The initial step of protein synthesis is the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the 7-methylguanosine (m(7)-GpppG) 5' cap of messenger RNAs1,2. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) represses cap-mediated translation by sequestering eIF4E through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)dependent mechanisms(3-6). Although the internal ribosome entry site is an alternative translation initiation mechanism, this pathway alone cannot account for the translational capacity of hypoxic cells(7,8). This raises a fundamental question in biology as to how proteins are synthesized in periods of oxygen scarcity and eIF4E inhibition(9). Here we describe an oxygen-regulated translation initiation complex that mediates selective cap-dependent protein synthesis. We show that hypoxia stimulates the formation of a complex that includes the oxygen-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha), the RNA-binding protein RBM4 and the cap-binding eIF4E2, an eIF4E homologue. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)(10) analysis identified an RNA hypoxia response element (rHRE) that recruits this complex to a wide array of mRNAs, including that encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. Once assembled at the rHRE, the HIF-2 alpha-RBM4-eIF4E2 complex captures the 5' cap and targets mRNAs to polysomes for active translation, thereby evading hypoxia-induced repression of protein synthesis. These findings demonstrate that cells have evolved a program by which oxygen tension switches the basic translation initiation machinery.","[Uniacke, James; Holterman, Chet E.; Lachance, Gabriel; Franovic, Aleksandra; Jacob, Mathieu D.; Payette, Josianne; Lee, Stephen] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada; [Fabian, Marc R.; Pause, Arnim] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Holcik, Martin] Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Res Inst, Apoptosis Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada","Lee, S (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.",slee@uottawa.ca,"Holcik, Martin/E-5372-2011","Holcik, Martin/0000-0002-1922-5299",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Terry Fox Foundation (Canadian Cancer Society) [700014]; Terry Fox Foundation; Canadian Cancer Society,"We thank J.

Determination of the structures of Na-v channels will shed light on ion channel mechanisms and facilitate potential clinical applications. A family of bacterial Na-v channels, exemplified by the Na+-selective channel of bacteria (NaChBac)(3), provides a useful model system for structure-function analysis. Here we report the crystal structure of NavRh, a NaChBac orthologue from the marine alphaproteobacterium HIMB114 (Rickettsiales sp. HIMB114; denoted Rh), at 3.05 angstrom resolution. The channel comprises an asymmetric tetramer. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of Thr 178 and Leu 179 constitute an inner site within the selectivity filter where a hydrated Ca2+ resides in the crystal structure. The outer mouth of the Na+ selectivity filter, defined by Ser 181 and Glu 183, is closed, as is the activation gate at the intracellular side of the pore. The voltage sensors adopt a depolarized conformation in which all the gating charges are exposed to the extracellular environment. We propose that NavRh is in an 'inactivated' conformation. Comparison of NavRh with Na(v)Ab(4) reveals considerable conformational rearrangements that may underlie the electromechanical coupling mechanism of voltage-gated channels.","[Zhang, Xu; Ren, Wenlin; Yan, Chuangye; Wang, Jiawei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xu; Ren, Wenlin; Yan, Chuangye; Wang, Jiawei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xu; Ren, Wenlin; Yan, Chuangye; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [DeCaen, Paul; Clapham, David E.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Cardiol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [DeCaen, Paul; Clapham, David E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tao, Xiao] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tang, Lin; He, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingjing] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, State Key Lab Drug Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Hasegawa, Kazuya; Kumasaka, Takashi] SPring 8, Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, Sayo, Hyogo 6795198, Japan","Yan, N (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",nyan@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Kumasaka, Takashi/0000-0001-9289-1557","Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918802, 2011CB910501, 2011CB911102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31125009, 91017011]; Tsinghua University","We thank R.

Inactivation is a hallmark of Na-V channel function and is critical for control of membrane excitability(3), but the structural basis for this process has remained elusive. Here we report crystallographic snapshots of the wild-type Na(V)Ab channel from Arcobacter butzleri captured in two potentially inactivated states at 3.2 angstrom resolution. Compared to previous structures of Na(V)Ab channels with cysteine mutations in the pore-lining S6 helices (ref. 4), the S6 helices and the intracellular activation gate have undergone significant rearrangements: one pair of S6 helices has collapsed towards the central pore axis and the other S6 pair has moved outward to produce a striking dimer-of-dimers configuration. An increase in global structural asymmetry is observed throughout our wild-type Na(V)Ab models, reshaping the ion selectivity filter at the extracellular end of the pore, the central cavity and its residues that are analogous to the mammalian drug receptor site, and the lateral pore fenestrations. The voltage-sensing domains have also shifted around the perimeter of the pore module in wild-type Na(V)Ab, compared to the mutant channel, and local structural changes identify a conserved interaction network that connects distant molecular determinants involved in Na-V channel gating and inactivation. These potential inactivated-state structures provide new insights into Na-V channel gating and novel avenues to drug development and therapy for a range of debilitating Na-V channelopathies.","[Payandeh, Jian; El-Din, Tamer M.

We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts, which represent 50% of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here we use genetic lineage tracing to show that resident non-myocytes in the murine heart can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo by local delivery of GMT after coronary ligation. Induced cardiomyocytes became binucleate, assembled sarcomeres and had cardiomyocyte-like gene expression. Analysis of single cells revealed ventricular cardiomyocyte-like action potentials, beating upon electrical stimulation, and evidence of electrical coupling. In vivo delivery of GMT decreased infarct size and modestly attenuated cardiac dysfunction up to 3 months after coronary ligation. Delivery of the pro-angiogenic and fibroblast-activating peptide, thymosin beta 4, along with GMT, resulted in further improvements in scar area and cardiac function. These findings demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in their native environment for potential regenerative purposes.","[Qian, Li; Huang, Yu; Spencer, C.

Forced expression of these factors in dividing non-cardiomyocytes in mice reprograms these cells into functional cardiac-like myocytes, improves cardiac function and reduces adverse ventricular remodelling following myocardial infarction.

During ageing, numerous intrinsic and extrinsic changes occur that result in altered stem-cell behaviour and reduced tissue maintenance and regeneration. In the Drosophila testis, ageing results in a marked decrease in the self-renewal factor Unpaired (Upd), leading to a concomitant loss of germline stem cells. Here we demonstrate that IGF-II messenger RNA binding protein (Imp) counteracts endogenous small interfering RNAs to stabilize upd (also known as os) RNA. However, similar to upd, Imp expression decreases in the hub cells of older males, which is due to the targeting of Imp by the heterochronic microRNA let-7. In the absence of Imp, upd mRNA therefore becomes unprotected and susceptible to degradation. Understanding the mechanistic basis for ageing-related changes in stem-cell behaviour will lead to the development of strategies to treat age-onset diseases and facilitate stem-cell-based therapies in older individuals.","[Toledano, Hila; D'Alterio, Cecilia; Jones, D.

Laser frequency combs are the ideal calibrators for astronomical spectrographs(2). They emit a spectrum of lines that are equally spaced in frequency(3) and that are as accurate and stable as the atomic clock relative to which the comb is stabilized. Absolute calibration(4) provides the radial velocity of an astronomical object relative to the observer (on Earth). For the detection of Earth-mass exoplanets(5,6) in Earth-like orbits around solar-type stars, or of cosmic acceleration(7-9), the observable is a tiny velocity change of less than 10 cm s(-1), where the repeatability of the calibration-the variation in stability across observations-is important. Hitherto, only laboratory systems(10-12) or spectrograph calibrations of limited performance(4,13,14) have been demonstrated. Here we report the calibration of an astronomical spectrograph with a short-term Doppler shift repeatability of 2.5 cm s(-1), and use it to monitor the star HD75289 and recompute the orbit of its planet.

Metastable states in Fermi gases with strong repulsive interactions(5-11) represent an exciting area of development. The realization of such systems is challenging, because a strong repulsive interaction in an atomic quantum gas implies the existence of a weakly bound molecular state, which makes the system intrinsically unstable against decay. Here we use radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure the complete excitation spectrum of fermionic K-40 impurities resonantly interacting with a Fermi sea of Li-6 atoms. In particular, we show that a well-defined quasiparticle exists for strongly repulsive interactions. We measure the energy and the lifetime of this 'repulsive polaron'(9,12,13), and probe its coherence properties by measuring the quasiparticle residue. The results are well described by a theoretical approach that takes into account the finite effective range of the interaction in our system. We find that when the effective range is of the order of the interparticle spacing, there is a substantial increase in the lifetime of the quasiparticles. The existence of such a long-lived, metastable many-body state offers intriguing prospects for the creation of exotic quantum phases in ultracold, repulsively interacting Fermi gases.","[Kohstall, C.; Zaccanti, M.; Jag, M.; Trenkwalder, A.; Schreck, F.; Grimm, R.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Kohstall, C.; Jag, M.; Grimm, R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Kohstall, C.; Jag, M.; Grimm, R.] Univ Innsbruck, Zentrum Quantenphys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Massignan, P.] Inst Ciencies Foton, Castelldefels 08860, Barcelona, Spain; [Bruun, G.

In the solid state, a well known case is an impurity coupled to a bosonic bath (such as lattice vibrations); the impurity and its accompanying lattice distortion form a new entity, a polaron. This quasiparticle plays an important role in the spectral function of high-transition-temperature superconductors, as well as in colossal magnetoresistance in manganites(1). For impurities in a fermionic bath, studies have considered heavy or immobile impurities which exhibit Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe(2) and the Kondo effect(3). More recently, mobile impurities have moved into the focus of research, and they have been found to form new quasiparticles known as Fermi polarons(4-7). The Fermi polaron problem constitutes the extreme, but conceptually simple, limit of two important quantum many-body problems: the crossover between a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate and a superfluid with BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) pairing with spin-imbalance(8) for attractive interactions, and Stoner's itinerant ferromagnetism(9) for repulsive interactions. It has been proposed that such quantum phases (and other elusive exotic states) might become realizable in Fermi gases confined to two dimensions(10,11). Their stability and observability are intimately related to the theoretically debated(12-16) properties of the Fermi polaron in a two-dimensional Fermi gas. Here we create and investigate Fermi polarons in a two-dimensional, spin-imbalanced Fermi gas, measuring their spectral function using momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(17-19). For attractive interactions, we find evidence for a disputed pairing transition between polarons and tightly bound dimers, which provides insight into the elementary pairing mechanism of imbalanced, strongly coupled two-dimensional Fermi gases. Additionally, for repulsive interactions, we study novel quasiparticles-repulsive polarons-the lifetime of which determines the possibility of stabilizing repulsively interacting Fermi systems.","[Koschorreck, Marco; Pertot, Daniel; Vogt, Enrico; Froehlich, Bernd; Feld, Michael; Koehl, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Kohl, M (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",mk540@cam.ac.uk,"Kohl, Michael/C-6114-2009; Koschorreck, Marco/D-1536-2009","Kohl, Michael/0000-0003-4055-713X; Koschorreck, Marco/0000-0003-0974-7007",EPSRC [EP/G029547/1]; Daimler-Benz Foundation; Studienstiftung; DAAD,"We thank S.

A particularly successful implementation is DNA origami, in which a long scaffold strand is folded by hundreds of short auxiliary strands into a complex shape(9,14-16,18-21,25). Modular strategies are in principle simpler and more versatile and have been used to assemble DNA(2-5,8,10-13,17,23) or RNA(7,22) tiles into periodic(3,4,7,22) and algorithmic(5) two-dimensional lattices, extended ribbons(10,12) and tubes(4,12,13), three-dimensional crystals(17), polyhedra(11) and simple finite two-dimensional shapes(7,8). But creating finite yet complex shapes from a large number of uniquely addressable tiles remains challenging. Here we solve this problem with the simplest tile form, a 'single-stranded tile' (SST) that consists of a 42-base strand of DNA composed entirely of concatenated sticky ends and that binds to four local neighbours during self-assembly(12). Although ribbons and tubes with controlled circumferences(12) have been created using the SST approach, we extend it to assemble complex two-dimensional shapes and tubes from hundreds (in some cases more than one thousand) distinct tiles. Our main design feature is a self-assembled rectangle that serves as a molecular canvas, with each of its constituent SST strands-folded into a 3 nm-by-7 nm tile and attached to four neighbouring tiles-acting as a pixel. A desired shape, drawn on the canvas, is then produced by one-pot annealing of all those strands that correspond to pixels covered by the target shape; the remaining strands are excluded. We implement the strategy with a master strand collection that corresponds to a 310-pixel canvas, and then use appropriate strand subsets to construct 107 distinct and complex two-dimensional shapes, thereby establishing SST assembly as a simple, modular and robust framework for constructing nanostructures with prescribed shapes from short synthetic DNA strands.","[Wei, Bryan; Yin, Peng] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wei, Bryan; Dai, Mingjie; Yin, Peng] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dai, Mingjie] Harvard Univ, Program Biophys, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Yin, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",py@hms.harvard.edu,"Dai, Mingjie/A-7612-2013","Dai, Mingjie/0000-0002-8665-4966","Office of Naval Research [N000141110914, N000141010827]; NSF [CCF1054898]; NIH [1DP2OD007292]; Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering","We thank S.

Radiogenic isotope variations are interpreted as evidence for the declining rates of continental crustal growth over time(3-5), with some estimates suggesting that over 70% of the present continental crustal reservoir was extracted by the end of the Archaean eon(3,5). Patterns of crustal growth and reworking in rocks younger than three billion years (Gyr) are thought to reflect the assembly and break-up of supercontinents by Wilson cycle processes and mark an important change in lithosphere dynamics(6). In southern West Greenland numerous studies have, however, argued for subduction settings and crust growth by arc accretion back to 3.8 Gyr ago(7-9), suggesting that modern-day tectonic regimes operated during the formation of the earliest crustal rock record. Here we report in situ uranium-lead, hafnium and oxygen isotope data from zircons of basement rocks in southern West Greenland across the critical time period during which modern-like tectonic regimes could have initiated. Our data show pronounced differences in the hafnium isotope-time patterns across this interval, requiring changes in the characteristics of the magmatic protolith. The observations suggest that 3.9-3.5-Gyr-old rocks differentiated from a >3.9-Gyr-old source reservoir with a chondritic to slightly depleted hafnium isotope composition. In contrast, rocks formed after 3.2 Gyr ago register the first additions of juvenile depleted material (that is, new mantle-derived crust) since 3.9 Gyr ago, and are characterized by striking shifts in hafnium isotope ratios similar to those shown by Phanerozoic subduction-related orogens(10-12). These data suggest a transitional period 3.5-3.2 Gyr ago from an ancient (3.9-3.5 Gyr old) crustal evolutionary regime unlike that of modern plate tectonics to a geodynamic setting after 3.2 Gyr ago that involved juvenile crust generation by plate tectonic processes.","[Naeraa, T.; Kokfelt, T.

It is taxonomically widespread but generally rare. Theory suggests that where colour polymorphism does occur, processes generating and maintaining it can promote speciation but the generality of this claim is unclear(1). Here we confirm, using species-level molecular phylogenies for five families of non-passerine birds, that colour polymorphism is associated with accelerated speciation rates in the three groups in which polymorphism is most prevalent. In all five groups, colour polymorphism is lost at a significantly greater rate than it is gained. Thus, the general rarity and phylogenetic dispersion of colour polymorphism is accounted for by a combination of higher speciation rate and higher transition rate from polymorphism to monomorphism, consistent with theoretical models where speciation is driven by fixation of one or more morphs(3). This is corroborated by evidence from a species-level molecular phylogeny of passerines, incorporating 4,128 (66.5%) extant species, that polymorphic species tend to be younger than monomorphic species. Our results provide empirical support for the general proposition, dating from classical evolutionary theory(2,4-6), that colour polymorphism can increase speciation rates.","[Hugall, Andrew F.; Stuart-Fox, Devi] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Stuart-Fox, D (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",ahugall@museum.vic.gov.au; devis@unimelb.edu.au,,"Stuart-Fox, Devi/0000-0003-3362-1412",Australian Research Council [DP1092908],"We thank M.

Solanum is one of the largest angiosperm genera(1) and includes annual and perennial plants from diverse habitats. Here we present a high-quality genome sequence of domesticated tomato, a draft sequence of its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium(2), and compare them to each other and to the potato genome (Solanum tuberosum). The two tomato genomes show only 0.6% nucleotide divergence and signs of recent admixture, but show more than 8% divergence from potato, with nine large and several smaller inversions. In contrast to Arabidopsis, but similar to soybean, tomato and potato small RNAs map predominantly to gene-rich chromosomal regions, including gene promoters. The Solanum lineage has experienced two consecutive genome triplications: one that is ancient and shared with rosids, and a more recent one. These triplications set the stage for the neofunctionalization of genes controlling fruit characteristics, such as colour and fleshiness.","[Sato, Shusei; Tabata, Satoshi; Hirakawa, Hideki; Asamizu, Erika; Shirasawa, Kenta; Isobe, Sachiko; Kaneko, Takakazu; Nakamura, Yasukazu; Shibata, Daisuke; Aoki, Koh] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, 2-6-7 Kazusa Kamatari, Kisarazu, Chiba 2920818, Japan; [Egholm, Michael; Knight, James] 454 Life Sci, Branford, CT 06405 USA; [Bogden, Robert] Amplicon Express Inc, Pullman, WA 99163 USA; [Li, Changbao] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Beijing Vegetable Res Ctr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Shuang, Yang; Xu, Xun; Pan, Shengkai; Cheng, Shifeng; Liu, Xin; Ren, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Li, Changbao; Han, Bin; Feng, Qi; Fan, Danlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Ctr Gene Res, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China; [Albiero, Alessandro; Dal Pero, Francesca; Todesco, Sara] BMR Genom SrL, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Van Eck, Joyce; Buels, Robert M.; Bombarely, Aureliano; Gosselin, Joseph R.; Huang, Minyun; Leto, Jonathan A.; Menda, Naama; Strickler, Susan; Mao, Linyong; Gao, Shan; Tecle, Isaak Y.; York, Thomas; Zheng, Yi; Vrebalov, Julia T.; Lee, JeMin; Zhong, Silin; Mueller, Lukas A.; Fei, Zhangjun; White, Ruth A.; Thannhauser, Theodore W.; Giovannoni, James J.] Cornell Univ, Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Stiekema, Willem J.] Ctr BioSyst Genom, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ribeca, Paolo; Alioto, Tyler] CNAG, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Yang, Wencai] China Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Dept Vegetable Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Huang, Sanwen; Du, Yongchen; Zhang, Zhonghua; Gao, Jianchang; Guo, Yanmei; Wang, Xiaoxuan; Li, Ying; He, Jun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetables & Flowers, Sinodutch Joint Lab Hort Genom Technol, Key Lab Hort Crops Genet Improvement,Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Chuanyou; Cheng, Zhukuan; Zuo, Jianru; Ren, Jianfeng; Zhao, Jiuhai; Yan, Liuhua; Jiang, Hongling; Wang, Bao; Li, Hongshuang; Li, Zhenjun; Fu, Fuyou; Chen, Bingtang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Genom, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Chuanyou; Cheng, Zhukuan; Zuo, Jianru; Ren, Jianfeng; Zhao, Jiuhai; Yan, Liuhua; Jiang, Hongling; Wang, Bao; Li, Hongshuang; Li, Zhenjun; Fu, Fuyou; Chen, Bingtang; Ling, Hongqing; Xue, Yongbiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ling, Hongqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Cell & Chromosome Engn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xue, Yongbiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Mol & Dev Biol Lab, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Ware, Doreen; McCombie, W.

Recombination in mammals has been recently linked to the activity of a histone H3 methyltransferase, PR domain containing 9 (PRDM9)(1-6), the product of the only known speciation-associated gene in mammals(7). PRDM9 is thought to determine the preferred recombination sites-recombination hotspots-through sequence-specific binding of its highly polymorphic multi-Zn-finger domain(8). Nevertheless, Prdm9 knockout mice are proficient at initiating recombination(9). Here we map and analyse the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in Prdm9 knockout mice and in two mouse strains with different Prdm9 alleles and their F-1 hybrid. We show that PRDM9 determines the positions of practically all hotspots in the mouse genome, with the exception of the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR)-the only area of the genome that undergoes recombination in 100% of cells(10). Surprisingly, hotspots are still observed in Prdm9 knockout mice, and as in wild type, these hotspots are found at H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation marks. However, in the absence of PRDM9, most recombination is initiated at promoters and at other sites of PRDM9-independent H3K4 trimethylation. Such sites are rarely targeted in wild-type mice, indicating an unexpected role of the PRDM9 protein in sequestering the recombination machinery away from gene-promoter regions and other functional genomic elements.","[Smagulova, Fatima; Petukhova, Galina V.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Brick, Kevin; Khil, Pavel; Camerini-Otero, R.

This is best illustrated by the sensory systems, in which the patterned feed-forward excitation provided by sensory organs and experience drives the formation of mature topographic circuits capable of extracting specific features of sensory stimuli(1,2). In contrast, little is known about the role of early activity in the development of the basal ganglia, a phylogenetically ancient group of nuclei fundamentally important for complex motor action and reward-based learning(3,4). These nuclei lack direct sensory input and are only loosely topographically organized(5,6), forming interlocking feed-forward and feed-back inhibitory circuits without laminar structure. Here we use transgenic mice and viral gene transfer methods to modulate neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity in vivo in the developing striatum. We find that the balance of activity between the two inhibitory and antagonist pathways in the striatum regulates excitatory innervation of the basal ganglia during development. These effects indicate that the propagation of activity through a multi-stage network regulates the wiring of the basal ganglia, revealing an important role of positive feedback in driving network maturation.","[Kozorovitskiy, Yevgenia; Saunders, Arpiar; Johnson, Caroline A.; Sabatini, Bernardo L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lowell, Bradford B.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Sabatini, BL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bsabatini@hms.harvard.edu,,"Kozorovitskiy, Yevgenia/0000-0002-3710-1484",NINDS [NS046579]; W.F.

Plaques comprise amyloid-beta fibrils that assemble from monomeric and oligomeric intermediates, and are prognostic indicators of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the importance of plaques to Alzheimer's disease, oligomers are considered to be the principal toxic forms of amyloid-beta(1,2). Interestingly, many adverse responses to amyloid-beta, such as cytotoxicity(3), microtubule loss(4), impaired memory and learning(5), and neuritic degeneration(6), are greatly amplified by tau expression. Amino-terminally truncated, pyroglutamylated (pE) forms of amyloid-beta(7,8) are strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease, are more toxic than amyloid-beta, residues 1-42 (A beta(1-42)) and A beta(1-40), and have been proposed as initiators of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis(9,10). Here we report a mechanism by which pE-A beta may trigger Alzheimer's disease. A beta(3(pE)-42) co-oligomerizes with excess A beta(1-42) to form metastable low-n oligomers (LNOs) that are structurally distinct and far more cytotoxic to cultured neurons than comparable LNOs made from A beta(1-42) alone. Tau is required for cytotoxicity, and LNOs comprising 5% A beta(3(pE)-42) plus 95% A beta(1-42) (5% pE-A beta) seed new cytotoxic LNOs through multiple serial dilutions into A beta(1-42) monomers in the absence of additional A beta(3(pE)-42). LNOs isolated from human Alzheimer's disease brain contained A beta(3(pE)-42), and enhanced A beta(3(pE)-42) formation in mice triggered neuron loss and gliosis at 3 months, but not in a tau-null background. We conclude that A beta(3(pE)-42) confers tau-dependent neuronal death and causes template-induced misfolding of A beta(1-42) into structurally distinct LNOs that propagate by a prion-like mechanism. Our results raise the possibility that A beta(3(pE)-42) acts similarly at a primary step in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.","[Nussbaum, Justin M.; Silva, Antonia; Swanson, Eric; Wangsanut, Tanaporn; Bloom, George S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Schilling, Stephan; Cynis, Holger; Demuth, Hans-Ulrich] Probiodrug AG, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Tayler, Kaycie; Wiltgen, Brian] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Hatami, Asa; Glabe, Charles G.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Roenicke, Raik; Reymann, Klaus] Deutsch Zentrum Neurodegenerat Erkrankungen, Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, D-39118 Magdeburg, Germany; [Hutter-Paier, Birgit] JSW Life Sci GmbH, A-8074 Grambach, Austria; [Alexandru, Anca; Jagla, Wolfgang; Graubner, Sigrid; Demuth, Hans-Ulrich] Ingenium Pharmaceut GmbH, D-82152 Munich, Germany; [Bloom, George S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Cell Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Bloom, GS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",Hans-Ulrich.Demuth@probiodrug.de; gsb4g@virginia.edu,"Wiltgen, Brian/D-2947-2013; Reymann, Klaus/J-8507-2013",,"Alzheimer's Association [4079]; Owens Family Foundation; Cure Alzheimer's Fund; NIH/NIGMS [T32 GM008136]; NIH/NIA [R01 AG033069, P50 AG16573]; German Federal Department of Science and Technology [03IS2211F]","The authors are grateful for support from the following sources: the Alzheimer's Association (grant 4079 to G.

Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs), a family of seven secreted glycoproteins, are known to support the activity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro and in vivo(1-10). ANGPTLs also have important roles in lipid metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammation, but were considered 'orphan ligands' because no receptors were identified(3,11,12). Here we show that the immune-inhibitory receptor human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) and its mouse orthologue paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PIRB) are receptors for several ANGPTLs. LILRB2 and PIRB are expressed on human and mouse HSCs, respectively, and the binding of ANGPTLs to these receptors supported ex vivo expansion of HSCs. In mouse transplantation acute myeloid leukaemia models, a deficiency in intracellular signalling of PIRB resulted in increased differentiation of leukaemia cells, revealing that PIRB supports leukaemia development. Our study indicates an unexpected functional significance of classical immune-inhibitory receptors in maintenance of stemness of normal adult stem cells and in support of cancer development.","[Zheng, Junke; Umikawa, Masato; Cui, Changhao; Li, Jiyuan; Chen, Xiaoli; Zhang, Chaozheng; Hyunh, HoangDinh; Kang, Xunlei; Silvany, Robert; Wan, Xuan; Ye, Jingxiao; Zhang, Cheng Cheng] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zheng, Junke; Umikawa, Masato; Cui, Changhao; Li, Jiyuan; Chen, Xiaoli; Zhang, Chaozheng; Hyunh, HoangDinh; Kang, Xunlei; Silvany, Robert; Wan, Xuan; Ye, Jingxiao; Zhang, Cheng Cheng] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Dev Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zheng, Junke] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Key Lab Cell Differentiat & Apoptosis Chinese Min, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Umikawa, Masato] Univ Ryukyus, Dept Med Biochem, Okinawa 9030215, Japan; [Canto, Alberto Puig; Ward, E.

However, the underlying mechanisms of cell death and survival under metabolic stress are not well understood. A key signalling pathway involved in metabolic adaptation is the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway(2,3). Energy stress conditions that decrease intracellular ATP levels below a certain level promote AMPK activation by LKB1. Previous studies showed that LKB1-deficient or AMPK-deficient cells are resistant to oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis(4-6), possibly because of the function of AMPK in metabolic adaptation. However, the mechanisms by which AMPK promotes metabolic adaptation in tumour cells are not fully understood. Here we show that AMPK activation, during energy stress, prolongs cell survival by redox regulation. Under these conditions, NADPH generation by the pentose phosphate pathway is impaired, but AMPK induces alternative routes to maintain NADPH and inhibit cell death. The inhibition of the acetyl-CoA carboxylases ACC1 and ACC2 by AMPK maintains NADPH levels by decreasing NADPH consumption in fatty-acid synthesis and increasing NADPH generation by means of fatty-acid oxidation. Knockdown of either ACC1 or ACC2 compensates for AMPK activation and facilitates anchorage-independent growth and solid tumour formation in vivo, whereas the activation of ACC1 or ACC2 attenuates these processes. Thus AMPK, in addition to its function in ATP homeostasis, has a key function in NADPH maintenance, which is critical for cancer cell survival under energy stress conditions, such as glucose limitations, anchorage-independent growth and solid tumour formation in vivo.","[Jeon, Sang-Min; Hay, Nissim] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Chandel, Navdeep S.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Hay, N (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",nhay@uic.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [CA090764, AG016927, AG025953]; Chicago Biomedical Consortium; Chicago Community;  [P60DK20595]","We thank B.

With scant exception, terrestrial organisms have evolved under predictable daily cycles owing to the Earth's rotation. The advantage conferred on organisms that anticipate such environmental cycles has driven the evolution of endogenous circadian rhythms that tune internal physiology to external conditions. The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms. Furthermore, we explore the interconnectivity between these metabolic cycles and transcription-translation feedback loops of the clockwork in each system. Our results suggest an intimate co-evolution of cellular timekeeping with redox homeostatic mechanisms after the Great Oxidation Event similar to 2.5 billion years ago.","[Edgar, Rachel S.; Valekunja, Utham K.; Feeney, Kevin A.; O'Neill, John S.; Reddy, Akhilesh B.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, Inst Metab Sci,Metab Res Labs,Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Green, Edward W.; Kyriacou, Charalambos P.] Univ Leicester, Dept Genet, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Zhao, Yuwei; Qin, Ximing; Xu, Yao; Johnson, Carl H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [van Ooijen, Gerben; Millar, Andrew J.] Synthet & Syst Biol SynthSys, Edinburgh EH9 3JD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Olmedo, Maria; Merrow, Martha] Univ Groningen, Ctr Life Sci, Dept Mol Chronobiol, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Pan, Min; Baliga, Nitin S.] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Maywood, Elizabeth S.; Hastings, Michael H.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England; [Millar, Andrew J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland","Reddy, AB (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, Inst Metab Sci,Metab Res Labs,Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England.",jso22@medschl.cam.ac.uk; areddy@cantab.net,"Olmedo, Maria/E-1824-2012; Johnson, Carl/I-4655-2014; Qin, Ximing/J-6485-2012; van Ooijen, Gerben/E-9371-2013; Millar, Andrew/G-2423-2012","Olmedo, Maria/0000-0002-5701-2665; van Ooijen, Gerben/0000-0001-7967-0637; O'Neill, John/0000-0003-2204-6096; Millar, Andrew/0000-0003-1756-3654; Edgar, Rachel/0000-0002-3348-0851; Hastings, Michael Harvey/0000-0001-8576-6651","Wellcome Trust [083643/Z/07/Z, 093734/Z/10/Z]; European Research Council (ERC) [281348]; EMBO; Medical Research Council Centre for Obesity and Related metabolic Disorders (MRC CORD); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; European Commission [018741]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/C006941/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [BB/D019621]; ENIGMA; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P50GM076547, R01GM088595, R01GM067152, R21HL102492]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Dutch Science Foundation VICI; University of Groningen","This work was primarily supported by the Wellcome Trust (083643/Z/07/Z and 093734/Z/10/Z), the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant No. 281348, MetaCLOCK), and EMBO Young Investigators Programme, as well as the Medical Research Council Centre for Obesity and Related metabolic Disorders (MRC CORD), and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

The small GTPase Rab5 has been proposed to be a master regulator of endosome biogenesis. Here, to test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of endosome dependency on Rab5 and validated it by titrating down all three Rab5 isoforms in adult mouse liver using state-of-the-art RNA interference technology. Unexpectedly, the endocytic system was resilient to depletion of Rab5 and collapsed only when Rab5 decreased to a critical level. Loss of Rab5 below this threshold caused a marked reduction in the number of early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes, associated with a block of low-density lipoprotein endocytosis. Loss of endosomes caused failure to deliver apical proteins to the bile canaliculi, suggesting a requirement for polarized cargo sorting. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the role of Rab5 as an endosome organizer in vivo and reveal the resilience mechanisms of the endocytic system.","[Zeigerer, Anja; Gilleron, Jerome; Marsico, Giovanni; Nonaka, Hidenori; Seifert, Sarah; Del Conte-Zerial, Perla; Kalaidzidis, Yannis; Zerial, Marino] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Bogorad, Roman L.; Koteliansky, Victor] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Epstein-Barash, Hila; Kuchimanchi, Satya; Peng, Chang Geng; Koteliansky, Victor] Alnylam Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ruda, Vera M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ruda, Vera M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ruda, Vera M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Hengstler, Jan G.] Leibniz Res Ctr Working Environm & Human Factors, D-44139 Dortmund, Germany; [Kalaidzidis, Yannis] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow 119899, Russia","Zerial, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",zerial@mpi-cbg.de,"Bogorad, Roman/G-2609-2011; Hengstler, Jan/O-1415-2013; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/H-3094-2016","Kalaidzidis, Yannis/0000-0002-6137-1193; Zeigerer, Anja/0000-0003-4072-0566; Gilleron, Jerome/0000-0002-6389-8685","Virtual Liver initiative; German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF); Max Planck Society (MPG); DFG; Marie Curie Action, Intra-European Fellowship [fp7-people-ief-2008]; EMBO","We acknowledge K.

They release 10(29) to 10(32) ergs of energy on a timescale of hours(1). Similar flares have been observed on many stars, with larger 'superflares' seen on a variety of stars(2,3), some of which are rapidly rotating(4,5) and some of which are of ordinary solar type(3,6). The small number of superflares observed on solar-type stars has hitherto precluded a detailed study of them. Here we report observations of 365 superflares, including some from slowly rotating solar-type stars, from about 83,000 stars observed over 120 days. Quasi-periodic brightness modulations observed in the solar-type stars suggest that they have much larger starspots than does the Sun. The maximum energy of the flare is not correlated with the stellar rotation period, but the data suggest that superflares occur more frequently on rapidly rotating stars. It has been proposed that hot Jupiters may be important in the generation of superflares on solar-type stars(7), but none have been discovered around the stars that we have studied, indicating that hot Jupiters associated with superflares are rare.","[Maehara, Hiroyuki; Shibayama, Takuya; Notsu, Shota; Notsu, Yuta; Nagao, Takashi; Kusaba, Satoshi; Honda, Satoshi; Nogami, Daisaku; Shibata, Kazunari] Kyoto Univ, Kwasan Observ, Yamashina Ku, Kyoto 6078471, Japan; [Maehara, Hiroyuki; Shibayama, Takuya; Notsu, Shota; Notsu, Yuta; Nagao, Takashi; Kusaba, Satoshi; Honda, Satoshi; Nogami, Daisaku; Shibata, Kazunari] Kyoto Univ, Hida Observ, Yamashina Ku, Kyoto 6078471, Japan","Maehara, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Kwasan Observ, Yamashina Ku, 17 Ohmine Cho Kita Kazan, Kyoto 6078471, Japan.",maehara@kwasan.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Notsu, Shota/0000-0003-2493-912X; Notsu, Yuta/0000-0002-0412-0849","NASA Science Mission Directorate; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","Kepler was selected as NASA's tenth Discovery mission.

A quantum interface can be realized by entangling the state of a single photon with the state of an atomic or solid-state quantum memory, as demonstrated in recent experiments with trapped ions(3,4), neutral atoms(5,6), atomic ensembles(7,8) and nitrogen-vacancy spins(9). The entangling interaction couples an initial quantum memory state to two possible light-matter states, and the atomic level structure of the memory determines the available coupling paths. In previous work, the transition parameters of these paths determined the phase and amplitude of the final entangled state, unless the memory was initially prepared in a superposition state(4) (a step that requires coherent control). Here we report fully tunable entanglement between a single Ca-40(+) ion and the polarization state of a single photon within an optical resonator. Our method, based on a bichromatic, cavity-mediated Raman transition, allows us to select two coupling paths and adjust their relative phase and amplitude.

Despite offering relatively high conversion efficiencies for solar energy, typical dye-sensitized solar cells suffer from durability problems that result from their use of organic liquid electrolytes containing the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple, which causes serious problems such as electrode corrosion and electrolyte leakage(3). Replacements for iodine-based liquid electrolytes have been extensively studied, but the efficiencies of the resulting devices remain low(3-9). Here we show that the solution-processable p-type direct bandgap semiconductor CsSnI3 can be used for hole conduction in lieu of a liquid electrolyte. The resulting solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells consist of CsSnI2.95F0.05 doped with SnF2, nanoporous TiO2 and the dye N719, and show conversion efficiencies of up to 10.2 per cent (8.51 per cent with a mask). With a bandgap of 1.3 electronvolts, CsSnI3 enhances visible light absorption on the red side of the spectrum to outperform the typical dye-sensitized solar cells in this spectral region.","[Chung, In; He, Jiaqing; Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Kanatzidis, MG (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",m-kanatzidis@northwestern.edu,"Chang, R.P.H/B-7505-2009; Chung, In/K-5036-2012","Chung, In/0000-0001-6274-3369","NSF-DMR [0843962]; DOE Energy Frontier Research Center, ANSER [DE-SC0001059]; Initiative for Energy and Sustainability at Northwestern (ISEN)","The authors acknowledge support for this collaborative research: NSF-DMR 0843962 for R.

Igneous geochemistry has been used to understand how changing heat flux influenced Archaean geodynamics(1,2), but records of systematic geochemical evolution are complicated by heterogeneity of the rock record and uncertainties regarding selection and preservation bias(3-5). Here we apply statistical sampling techniques to a geochemical database of about 70,000 samples from the continental igneous rock record to produce a comprehensive record of secular geochemical evolution throughout Earth history. Consistent with secular mantle cooling, compatible and incompatible elements in basalts record gradually decreasing mantle melt fraction through time. Superimposed on this gradual evolution is a pervasive geochemical discontinuity occurring about 2.5 Gyr ago, involving substantial decreases in mantle melt fraction in basalts, and in indicators of deep crustal melting and fractionation, such as Na/K, Eu/Eu* (europium anomaly(4)) and La/Yb ratios in felsic rocks. Along with an increase in preserved crustal thickness across the Archaean/Proterozoic boundary(6,7), these data are consistent with a model in which high-degree Archaean mantle melting produced a thick, mafic lower crust and consequent deep crustal delamination and melting-leading to abundant tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite magmatism and a thin preserved Archaean crust. The coincidence of the observed changes in geochemistry and crustal thickness with stepwise atmospheric oxidation(8) at the end of the Archaean eon provides a significant temporal link between deep Earth geochemical processes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen on the Earth.","[Keller, C.

For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses, they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming, including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing(3-5). We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.","[Wolkovich, E.

At the largest scale, rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) engulf and filter prey-laden water by lunge feeding(4), a strategy that is unique among vertebrates(1). Lunge feeding is facilitated by several morphological specializations, including bilaterally separate jaws that loosely articulate with the skull(5,6), hyper-expandable throat pleats, or ventral groove blubber(7), and a rigid y-shaped fibrocartilage structure branching from the chin into the ventral groove blubber(8). The linkages and functional coordination among these features, however, remain poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a sensory organ embedded within the fibrous symphysis between the unfused jaws that is present in several rorqual species, at both fetal and adult stages. Vascular and nervous tissue derived from the ancestral, anterior-most tooth socket insert into this organ, which contains connective tissue and papillae suspended in a gel-like matrix. These papillae show the hallmarks of a mechanoreceptor, containing nerves and encapsulated nerve termini. Histological, anatomical and kinematic evidence indicate that this sensory organ responds to both the dynamic rotation of the jaws during mouth opening and closure, and ventral groove blubber(7) expansion through direct mechanical linkage with the y-shaped fibrocartilage structure. Along with vibrissae on the chin(9), providing tactile prey sensation, this organ provides the necessary input to the brain for coordinating the initiation, modulation and end stages of engulfment, a paradigm that is consistent with unsteady hydrodynamic models and tag data from lunge-feeding rorquals(10-13). Despite the antiquity of unfused jaws in baleen whales since the late Oligocene(14) (similar to 23-28 million years ago), this organ represents an evolutionary novelty for rorquals, based on its absence in all other lineages of extant baleen whales. This innovation has a fundamental role in one of the most extreme feeding methods in aquatic vertebrates, which facilitated the evolution of the largest vertebrates ever.","[Pyenson, Nicholas D.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Pyenson, Nicholas D.] Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Dept Mammal, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pyenson, Nicholas D.] Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, Dept Paleontol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Goldbogen, Jeremy A.] Cascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Vogl, A.

To obtain a comprehensive genomic view of melanoma in humans, we sequenced the genomes of 25 metastatic melanomas and matched germline DNA. A wide range of point mutation rates was observed: lowest in melanomas whose primaries arose on non-ultraviolet-exposed hairless skin of the extremities (3 and 14 per megabase (Mb) of genome), intermediate in those originating from hair-bearing skin of the trunk (5-55 per Mb), and highest in a patient with a documented history of chronic sun exposure (111 per Mb). Analysis of whole-genome sequence data identified PREX2 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2)-a PTEN-interacting protein and negative regulator of PTEN in breast cancer(2)-as a significantly mutated gene with a mutation frequency of approximately 14% in an independent extension cohort of 107 human melanomas. PREX2 mutations are biologically relevant, as ectopic expression of mutant PREX2 accelerated tumour formation of immortalized human melanocytes in vivo. Thus, whole-genome sequencing of human melanoma tumours revealed genomic evidence of ultraviolet pathogenesis and discovered a new recurrently mutated gene in melanoma.","[Berger, Michael F.; Hodis, Eran; Lawrence, Michael S.; Nickerson, Elizabeth; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Onofrio, Robert; Ambrogio, Lauren; Auclair, Daniel; Fennell, Timothy; Carter, Scott L.; Stojanov, Petar; Voet, Douglas; Jing, Rui; Saksena, Gordon; Barretina, Jordi; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Stransky, Nicolas; Parkin, Melissa; Winckler, Wendy; Mahan, Scott; Ardlie, Kristin; Baldwin, Jennifer; Meyerson, Matthew; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Golub, Todd R.; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad; Chin, Lynda; Garraway, Levi A.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Heffernan, Timothy P.; Deribe, Yonathan Lissanu; Protopopov, Alexei; Ivanova, Elena; Watson, Ian R.; Ghosh, Papia; Zhang, Hailei; Zeid, Rhamy; Ren, Xiaojia; Wagle, Nikhil; Singer, Meredith A.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Meyerson, Matthew; Chin, Lynda; Garraway, Levi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wagle, Nikhil; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Meyerson, Matthew; Chin, Lynda; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sucker, Antje; Schadendorf, Dirk] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Dermatol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; [Drier, Yotam] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Wargo, Jennifer] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Meyerson, Matthew; Golub, Todd R.; Garraway, Levi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Wagner, Stephan N.] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Dermatol, Div Immunol Allergy & Infect Dis, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Wagner, Stephan N.] Austrian Acad Sci, CeMM Res Ctr Mol Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lander, Eric S.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Chin, L (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Inst Appl Canc Sci, Dept Genom Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",LChin@mdanderson.org; levi_garraway@dfci.harvard.edu,"Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; Drier, Yotam/K-5208-2012","Drier, Yotam/0000-0003-1725-2995; Wagner, Stephan/0000-0003-4941-7029",National Human Genome Research Institute; National Cancer Institute; FWF-Austrian Science Fund; NIH; Melanoma Research Alliance; Starr Cancer Consortium; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund,"Illumina sequencing was performed at the Broad Institute and array-based genomic characterization and functional studies were performed at the Belfer Institute of DFCI.

Many of these disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases, are associated with the accumulation of misfolded disease-specific proteins. The unfolded protein response is a protective cellular mechanism triggered by rising levels of misfolded proteins. One arm of this pathway results in the transient shutdown of protein translation, through phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF2. Activation of the unfolded protein response and/or increased eIF2 alpha-P levels are seen in patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases(1-4), but how this links to neurodegeneration is unknown. Here we show that accumulation of prion protein during prion replication causes persistent translational repression of global protein synthesis by eIF2 alpha-P, associated with synaptic failure and neuronal loss in prion-diseased mice. Further, we show that promoting translational recovery in hippocampi of prion-infected mice is neuroprotective. Overexpression of GADD34, a specific eIF2 alpha-P phosphatase, as well as reduction of levels of prion protein by lentivirally mediated RNA interference, reduced eIF2 alpha-P levels. As a result, both approaches restored vital translation rates during prion disease, rescuing synaptic deficits and neuronal loss, thereby significantly increasing survival. In contrast, salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2 alpha-P dephosphorylation(5), increased eIF2 alpha-P levels, exacerbating neurotoxicity and significantly reducing survival in prion-diseased mice. Given the prevalence of protein misfolding and activation of the unfolded protein response in several neurodegenerative diseases, our results suggest that manipulation of common pathways such as translational control, rather than disease-specific approaches, may lead to new therapies preventing synaptic failure and neuronal loss across the spectrum of these disorders.","[Moreno, Julie A.; Radford, Helois; Peretti, Diego; Steinert, Joern R.; Verity, Nicholas; Martin, Maria Guerra; Halliday, Mark; Morgan, Jason; Dinsdale, David; Willis, Anne E.; Bushell, Martin; Mallucci, Giovanna R.] Univ Leicester, MRC, Toxicol Unit, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Ortori, Catherine A.; Barrett, David A.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharm, Ctr Analyt Biosci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Tsaytler, Pavel; Bertolotti, Anne] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Mallucci, GR (reprint author), Univ Leicester, MRC, Toxicol Unit, Hodgkin Bldg,Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England.",grm7@le.ac.uk,"Steinert, Joern/A-6678-2008; Barrett, David/C-9922-2011","Steinert, Joern/0000-0003-1640-0845; Barrett, David/0000-0001-6900-9474","Medical Research Council, UK","We thank D.

APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease(2,3) and is associated with Down's syndrome dementia and poor neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury and haemorrhage(3). Neurovascular dysfunction is present in normal APOE4 carriers(4-6) and individuals with APOE4-associated disorders(3,7-10). In mice, lack of Apoe leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown(11,12), whereas APOE4 increases BBB susceptibility to injury(13). How APOE genotype affects brain microcirculation remains elusive. Using different APOE transgenic mice, including mice with ablation and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), here we show that expression of APOE4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not APOE2 and APOE3, leads to BBB breakdown by activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-kappa B-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes. This, in turn, leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived neurotoxic proteins, and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions. We show that the vascular defects in Apoe-deficient and APOE4-expressing mice precede neuronal dysfunction and can initiate neurodegenerative changes. Astrocyte-secreted APOE3, but not APOE4, suppressed the CypA-nuclear factor-kappa B-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes through a lipoprotein receptor. Our data suggest that CypA is a key target for treating APOE4-mediated neurovascular injury and the resulting neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.","[Bell, Robert D.; Winkler, Ethan A.; Singh, Itender; Sagare, Abhay P.; Deane, Rashid; Wu, Zhenhua; Sallstrom, Jan; Zlokovic, Berislav V.] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Ctr Neurodegenerat & Vasc Brain Disorders, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Bell, Robert D.; Berk, Bradford C.] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Aab Cardiovasc Res Inst, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Holtzman, David M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Knight Alzheimers Dis Res Ctr, Hope Ctr Neurol Disorders,Dept Neurol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Betsholtz, Christer; Armulik, Annika] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Vasc Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Armulik, Annika] Univ Zurich Hosp, Inst Neuropathol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zlokovic, Berislav V.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Ctr Neurodegenerat & Regenerat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Zlokovic, Berislav V.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Zlokovic, BV (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Ctr Neurodegenerat & Vasc Brain Disorders, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.",zlokovic@usc.edu,,"Keller, Annika/0000-0003-1466-3633; Berk, Bradford/0000-0002-2767-4115","National Institute of Health [R37NS34467, R37AG23084, RO1AG039452, R37AG13956]",We would like to thank the National Institute of Health for grants R37NS34467 (B.V.Z.); R37AG23084 (B.V.Z.); RO1AG039452 (B.V.Z.); and R37AG13956 (D.

However, the underlying support mechanisms are not understood(4). Here we identify a metabolic component of axon-glia interactions by generating conditional Cox10 (protoheme IX farnesyltransferase) mutant mice, in which oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells fail to assemble stable mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX, also known as mitochondrial complex IV). In the peripheral nervous system, Cox10 conditional mutants exhibit severe neuropathy with dysmyelination, abnormal Remak bundles, muscle atrophy and paralysis. Notably, perturbing mitochondrial respiration did not cause glial cell death. In the adult central nervous system, we found no signs of demyelination, axonal degeneration or secondary inflammation. Unlike cultured oligodendrocytes, which are sensitive to COX inhibitors(5), post-myelination oligodendrocytes survive well in the absence of COX activity. More importantly, by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy, brain lactate concentrations in mutants were increased compared with controls, but were detectable only in mice exposed to volatile anaesthetics. This indicates that aerobic glycolysis products derived from oligodendrocytes are rapidly metabolized within white matter tracts. Because myelinated axons can use lactate when energy-deprived(6), our findings suggest a model in which axon-glia metabolic coupling serves a physiological function.","[Fuenfschilling, Ursula; Supplie, Lotti M.; Saab, Aiman S.; Edgar, Julia; Brinkmann, Bastian G.; Kassmann, Celia M.; Tzvetanova, Iva D.; Moebius, Wiebke; Hamprecht, Bernd; Sereda, Michael W.; Goebbels, Sandra; Nave, Klaus-Armin] Max Planck Inst Expt Med, Dept Neurogenet, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Mahad, Don] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Inst Ageing & Hlth, Mitochondrial Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Boretius, Susann; Frahm, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Biomed NMR Forsch GmbH, D-37070 Gottingen, Germany; [Diaz, Francisca; Moraes, Carlos T.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Cell Biol & Anat, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Meijer, Dies] Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Suter, Ueli] ETH Honggerberg, Dept Biol, Inst Cell Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sereda, Michael W.] Univ Gottingen UMG, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Nave, KA (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Expt Med, Dept Neurogenet, Hermann Rein Str 3, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",nave@em.mpg.de,"Suter, Ueli/A-1624-2010; Edgar, Julia /G-3275-2012; Meijer, Dies/C-7786-2012","Meijer, Dies/0000-0002-8461-6341; Mobius, Wiebke/0000-0002-2902-7165; Boretius, Susann/0000-0003-2792-7423",BMBF (Leukonet); DFG (CMPB); EU; Oliver's Army; Swiss National Science Foundation; National Center 'Neural Plasticity and Repair'; Swiss National Science Foundation [PAOOA-117479/1]; European Leukodystrophy Association,"We thank C.

Here we show that in numerous fungal species, several core enzymes of glycolysis, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), reside in both the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. We detected in these enzymes cryptic type 1 peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1)(3), which are activated by post-transcriptional processes. Notably, the molecular mechanisms that generate the peroxisomal isoforms vary considerably among different species. In the basidiomycete plant pathogen Ustilago maydis, peroxisomal targeting of Pgk1 results from ribosomal read-through, whereas alternative splicing generates the PTS1 of Gapdh. In the filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans, peroxisomal targeting of these enzymes is achieved by exactly the opposite mechanisms. We also detected PTS1 motifs in the glycolytic enzymes triose-phosphate isomerase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. U. maydis mutants lacking the peroxisomal isoforms of Gapdh or Pgk1 showed reduced virulence. In addition, mutational analysis suggests that GAPDH, together with other peroxisomal NADH-dependent dehydrogenases, has a role in redox homeostasis. Owing to its hidden nature, partial peroxisomal targeting of well-studied cytoplasmic enzymes has remained undetected. Thus, we anticipate that further bona fide cytoplasmic proteins exhibit similar dual targeting.","[Freitag, Johannes; Ast, Julia; Boelker, Michael] Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Bolker, M (reprint author), Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",boelker@uni-marburg.de,,"Ast, Julia/0000-0002-0039-4762",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG-GK1216]; Marburg University Research Academy (MARA),We are indebted to J.

The SmpB protein forms a complex with the tmRNA, and the transfer-RNA-like domain (TLD) of the tmRNA then enters the A site of the ribosome. Subsequently, the TLD-SmpB module is translocated to the P site, a process that is facilitated by the elongation factor EF-G, and translation is switched to the mRNA-like domain (MLD) of the tmRNA. Accurate loading of the MLD into the mRNA path is an unusual initiation mechanism. Despite various snapshots of different ribosome-tmRNA complexes at low to intermediate resolution(3-7), it is unclear how the large, highly structured tmRNA is translocated and how the MLD is loaded. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a fusidic-acid-stalled ribosomal 70S-tmRNA-SmpB-EF-G complex (carrying both of the large ligands, that is, EF-G and tmRNA) at 8.3 angstrom resolution. This post-translocational intermediate (TIPOST) presents the TLD-SmpB module in an intrasubunit ap/P hybrid site and a tRNA(fMet) in an intrasubunit pe/E hybrid site. Conformational changes in the ribosome and tmRNA occur in the intersubunit space and on the solvent side. The key underlying event is a unique extra-large swivel movement of the 30S head, which is crucial for both tmRNA-SmpB translocation and MLD loading, thereby coupling translocation to MLD loading. This mechanism exemplifies the versatile, dynamic nature of the ribosome, and it shows that the conformational modes of the ribosome that normally drive canonical translation can also be used in a modified form to facilitate more complex tasks in specialized non-canonical pathways.","[Ramrath, David J.

However, the lineage of the enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI) remained unknown. In vascular plants, CHI-catalysed conversion of chalcones to chiral (S)-flavanones is a committed step in the production of plant flavonoids, compounds that contribute to attraction, defence(2) and development(3). CHI operates near the diffusion limit with stereospecific control(4,5). Although associated primarily with plants, the CHI fold occurs in several other eukaryotic lineages and in some bacteria. Here we report crystal structures, ligand-binding properties and in vivo functional characterization of a non-catalytic CHI-fold family from plants. Arabidopsis thaliana contains five actively transcribed genes encoding CHI-fold proteins, three of which additionally encode amino-terminal chloroplast-transit sequences. These three CHI-fold proteins localize to plastids, the site of de novo fatty-acid biosynthesis in plant cells. Furthermore, their expression profiles correlate with those of core fatty-acid biosynthetic enzymes, with maximal expression occurring in seeds and coinciding with increased fatty-acid storage in the developing embryo. In vitro, these proteins are fatty-acid-binding proteins (FAPs). FAP knockout A. thaliana plants show elevated alpha-linolenic acid levels and marked reproductive defects, including aberrant seed formation. Notably, the FAP discovery defines the adaptive evolution of a stereospecific and catalytically 'perfected' enzyme(6) from a non-enzymatic ancestor over a defined period of plant evolution.","[Ngaki, Micheline N.; Li, Ling; Wurtele, Eve Syrkin] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Louie, Gordon V.; Philippe, Ryan N.; Pojer, Florence; Bowman, Marianne E.; Larsen, Elise; Noel, Joseph P.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Jack H Skirball Ctr Chem Biol & Prote, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Manning, Gerard] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Razavi Newman Ctr Bioinformat, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Wurtele, ES (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mash@iastate.edu; noel@salk.edu,"Li, Ling/B-6598-2012; FIP, BM30A/I-5166-2015","Li, Ling/0000-0003-2371-6215; Manning, Gerard/0000-0002-5087-9151; Wurtele, Eve/0000-0003-1552-9495","Fulbright Fellowship; National Science Foundation [MCB-0645794, EEC-0813570, MCB-0951170]; National Cancer Institute [CA14195]; Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University; Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences","We thank A.

Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the mu-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6.

The structure reveals important features of the ligand-binding pocket that contribute to the high affinity and subtype selectivity of JDTic for the human kappa-OR. Modelling of other important kappa-OR-selective ligands, including the morphinan-derived antagonists norbinaltorphimine and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole, and the diterpene agonist salvinorin A analogue RB-64, reveals both common and distinct features for binding these diverse chemotypes. Analysis of site-directed mutagenesis and ligand structure-activity relationships confirms the interactions observed in the crystal structure, thereby providing a molecular explanation for kappa-OR subtype selectivity, and essential insights for the design of compounds with new pharmacological properties targeting the human kappa-OR.","[Wu, Huixian; Wacker, Daniel; Mileni, Mauro; Katritch, Vsevolod; Han, Gye Won; Liu, Wei; Thompson, Aaron A.; Cherezov, Vadim; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Vardy, Eyal; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill Med Sch, Natl Inst Mental Hlth Psychoact Drug Screening Pr, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Vardy, Eyal; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill Med Sch, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Carroll, F.

The aetiology of PPCM, and why it is associated with pre-eclampsia, remain unknown. Here we show that PPCM is associated with a systemic angiogenic imbalance, accentuated by pre-eclampsia. Mice that lack cardiac PGC-1 alpha, a powerful regulator of angiogenesis, develop profound PPCM. Importantly, the PPCM is entirely rescued by pro-angiogenic therapies. In humans, the placenta in late gestation secretes VEGF inhibitors like soluble FLT1 (sFLT1), and this is accentuated by multiple gestation and pre-eclampsia. This anti-angiogenic environment is accompanied by subclinical cardiac dysfunction, the extent of which correlates with circulating levels of sFLT1. Exogenous sFLT1 alone caused diastolic dysfunction in wild-type mice, and profound systolic dysfunction in mice lacking cardiac PGC-1a. Finally, plasma samples from women with PPCM contained abnormally high levels of sFLT1. These data indicate that PPCM is mainly a vascular disease, caused by excess anti-angiogenic signalling in the peripartum period. The data also explain how late pregnancy poses a threat to cardiac homeostasis, and why pre-eclampsia and multiple gestation are important risk factors for the development of PPCM.","[Patten, Ian S.; Rowe, Glenn C.; Jang, Cholsoon; Liu, Laura; Farrell, Caitlin; Koulisis, Nicole; del Monte, Federica; Arany, Zoltan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Cardiovasc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Patten, Ian S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Vasc Biol Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rana, Sarosh; Hacker, Michele R.; Rhee, Julie S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Maternal Fetal Med,Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shahul, Sajid; Mitchell, John; Mahmood, Feroze; Hess, Philip] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesia & Crit Care, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Khankin, Eliyahu V.; Burke, Suzanne D.; Karumanchi, S.

When induced by an intense laser field, electron tunnelling from atoms and molecules initiates a broad range of phenomena such as the generation of attosecond pulses(1), laser-induced electron diffraction(2,3) and holography(2,4). These processes evolve on the attosecond timescale (1 attosecond equivalent to 1 as = 10(-18) seconds) and are well suited to the investigation of a general issue much debated since the early days of quantum mechanics(5-7)-the link between the tunnelling of an electron through a barrier and its dynamics outside the barrier. Previous experiments have measured tunnelling rates with attosecond time resolution(8) and tunnelling delay times(9). Here we study laser-induced tunnelling by using a weak probe field to steer the tunnelled electron in the lateral direction and then monitor the effect on the attosecond light bursts emitted when the liberated electron re-encounters the parent ion(10). We show that this approach allows us to measure the time at which the electron exits from the tunnelling barrier. We demonstrate the high sensitivity of the measurement by detecting subtle delays in ionization times from two orbitals of a carbon dioxide molecule. Measurement of the tunnelling process is essential for all attosecond experiments where strong-field ionization initiates ultrafast dynamics(10). Our approach provides a general tool for time-resolving multi-electron rearrangements in atoms and molecules(11-13)-one of the key challenges in ultrafast science.","[Shafir, Dror; Soifer, Hadas; Bruner, Barry D.; Dagan, Michal; Dudovich, Nirit] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Mairesse, Yann] Univ Bordeaux 1, CEA, CNRS, CELIA,UMR5107, F-33400 Talence, France; [Patchkovskii, Serguei] Natl Res Council Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada; [Ivanov, Misha Yu.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Phys, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ivanov, Misha Yu.; Smirnova, Olga] Max Born Inst Nonlinear Opt & Short Pulse Spect, D-12489 Berlin, Germany","Dudovich, N (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",nirit.dudovich@weizmann.ac.il,"Soifer, Hadas/G-5522-2010; Mairesse, Yann/B-3049-2015","Soifer, Hadas/0000-0001-8879-0577","Minerva Foundation; Israeli Science Foundation; Crown Center of Photonics; Israeli Ministry of Science; Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; DFG [Sm292/2-1]; EPSRC [EP/I032517/1, EP/I0325171/1]; ANR [ANR-08-JCJC-0029 HarModyn]; Conseil Regional d'Aquitaine [20091304003 AttoMol]","N.D. acknowledges the Minerva Foundation, the Israeli Science Foundation and the Crown Center of Photonics for financial support.

The most widely known and applied class of liquid crystals are a subset of thermotropic liquid crystals known as calamitic, in which adding heat can result in phase transitions from or into the nematic, cholesteric and smectic mesophases. Photoresponsive liquid-crystal materials and mixtures can undergo isothermal phase transitions if light affects the order parameter of the system within a mesophase sufficiently. In nearly all previous examinations, light exposure of photoresponsive liquid-crystal materials and mixtures resulted in order-decreasing photo-induced isothermal phase transitions(2). Under specialized conditions, an increase in order with light exposure has been reported, despite the tendency of the photoresponsive liquid-crystal system to reduce order in the exposed state(3-7). A direct, photoinduced transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase has been observed in a mixture of spiropyran molecules and a nematic liquid crystal(8). Here we report a class of naphthopyran-based materials that exhibit photo-induced conformational changes in molecular structure capable of yielding order-increasing phase transitions. Appropriate functionalization of the naphthopyran molecules leads to an exceedingly large order parameter in the open form, which results in a clear to strongly absorbing dichroic state. The increase in order with light exposure has profound implications in optics, photonics, lasing and displays and will merit further consideration for applications in solar energy harvesting. The large, photoinduced dichroism exhibited by the material system has been long sought in ophthalmic applications such as photochromic and polarized variable transmission sunglasses.","[Kosa, Tamas; Sukhomlinova, Ludmila; Su, Linli; Taheri, Bahman] Alpha Micron Inc, Kent, OH 44240 USA; [White, Timothy J.; Bunning, Timothy J.] Mat & Mfg Directorate, AF Res Lab, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA","Kosa, T (reprint author), Alpha Micron Inc, Kent, OH 44240 USA.",tamas@alphamicron.com; timothy.white2@wpafb.af.mil,"White, Timothy/D-4392-2012",,US Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Materials and Manufacturing Directorate of the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research; US Air Force [FA8650-05-D-5807],"T.J.W. and T.J.B. were supported by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate of the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

This expansion is important because it is associated with shifts in large-scale atmospheric circulation(2-4) and major climate zones(5,6). Although recent studies have attributed tropical expansion in the Southern Hemisphere to ozone depletion(7-10), the drivers of Northern Hemisphere expansion are not well known and the expansion has not so far been reproduced by climate models(11). Here we use a climate model with detailed aerosol physics to show that increases in heterogeneous warming agents-including black carbon aerosols and tropospheric ozone-are noticeably better than greenhouse gases at driving expansion, and can account for the observed summertime maximum in tropical expansion. Mechanistically, atmospheric heating from black carbon and tropospheric ozone has occurred at the mid-latitudes, generating a poleward shift of the tropospheric jet(12), thereby relocating the main division between tropical and temperate air masses. Although we still underestimate tropical expansion, the true aerosol forcing is poorly known and could also be underestimated. Thus, although the insensitivity of models needs further investigation, black carbon and tropospheric ozone, both of which are strongly influenced by human activities, are the most likely causes of observed Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion.","[Allen, Robert J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sherwood, Steven C.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Sherwood, Steven C.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Norris, Joel R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Zender, Charles S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Allen, RJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rjallen@ucr.edu,"Zender, Charles/D-4485-2012; Sherwood, Steven/B-5673-2008","Zender, Charles/0000-0003-0129-8024; Sherwood, Steven/0000-0001-7420-8216",University of California at Riverside,"This study was funded by R.J.A.'s University of California at Riverside initial complement.

Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution(1). Estimates of CMB heat flux(2-5) depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles-unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work(6) and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump(7,8). We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection(1); the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core.","[Pozzo, Monica; Alfe, Dario] UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Pozzo, Monica; Alfe, Dario] UCL, Thomas Young Ctr UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Davies, Chris; Gubbins, David] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Gubbins, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Alfe, Dario] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Alfe, Dario] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Alfe, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Earth Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",d.alfe@ucl.ac.uk,"Alfe`, Dario/C-1521-2008; Pozzo, Monica/C-4965-2011; Davies, Chris/I-7652-2012","Alfe`, Dario/0000-0002-9741-8678; Davies, Chris/0000-0002-1074-3815; Gubbins, David/0000-0002-8125-4752","CSEDI from the National Science Foundation [EAR1065597]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H01571X/1, NE/H02462X/1]","D.G. is supported by CSEDI grant EAR1065597 from the National Science Foundation.

Extended leaf phenology, whereby understory species assimilate carbon in early spring before canopy closure or in late autumn after canopy fall, has been identified as a key feature of many forest species invasions(5,8-10), but it remains unclear whether there are systematic differences in the growth phenology of native and invasive forest species(11) or whether invaders are more responsive to warming trends that have lengthened the duration of spring or autumn growth(12). Here, in a 3-year monitoring study of 43 native and 30 non-native shrub and liana species common to deciduous forests in the eastern United States, I show that extended autumn leaf phenology is a common attribute of eastern US forest invasions, where non-native species are extending the autumn growing season by an average of 4 weeks compared with natives. In contrast, there was no consistent evidence that non-natives as a group show earlier spring growth phenology, and non-natives were not better able to track interannual variation in spring temperatures. Seasonal leaf production and photosynthetic data suggest that most non-native species capture a significant proportion of their annual carbon assimilate after canopy leaf fall, a behaviour that was virtually absent in natives and consistent across five phylogenetic groups. Pronounced differences in how native and non-native understory species use pre- and post-canopy environments suggest eastern US invaders are driving a seasonal redistribution of forest productivity that may rival climate change in its impact on forest processes.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Fridley, JD (reprint author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 107 Coll Pl, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",fridley@syr.edu,,,Syracuse University,"I acknowledge technical assistance and advice from A.

We have dissected a region of the 16p11.2 chromosome-which encompasses 29 genes-that confers susceptibility to neurocognitive defects when deleted or duplicated(2,3). Overexpression of each human transcript in zebrafish embryos identified KCTD13 as the sole message capable of inducing the microcephaly phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 duplication(2-5), whereas suppression of the same locus yielded the macrocephalic phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 deletion(5,6), capturing the mirror phenotypes of humans. Analyses of zebrafish and mouse embryos suggest that microcephaly is caused by decreased proliferation of neuronal progenitors with concomitant increase in apoptosis in the developing brain, whereas macrocephaly arises by increased proliferation and no changes in apoptosis. A role for KCTD13 dosage changes is consistent with autism in both a recently reported family with a reduced 16p11.2 deletion and a subject reported here with a complex 16p11.2 rearrangement involving de novo structural alteration of KCTD13. Our data suggest that KCTD13 is a major driver for the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with the 16p11.2 CNV, reinforce the idea that one or a small number of transcripts within a CNV can underpin clinical phenotypes, and offer an efficient route to identifying dosage-sensitive loci.","[Golzio, Christelle; Willer, Jason; Oh, Edwin C.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Golzio, Christelle; Willer, Jason; Oh, Edwin C.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Talkowski, Michael E.; Sun, Mei; Gusella, James F.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Mol Neurogenet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Talkowski, Michael E.; Gusella, James F.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Taniguchi, Yu; Sawa, Akira; Kamiya, Atsushi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Jacquemont, Sebastien; Beckmann, Jacques S.] CHU Vaudois, Serv Med Genet, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Reymond, Alexandre] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Gen, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Beckmann, Jacques S.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Med Genet, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Dept Pediat, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Katsanis, N (reprint author), Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",katsanis@cellbio.duke.edu,"Katsanis, Nicholas/E-1837-2012; kamiya, atsushi/L-8550-2016; Beckmann, Jacques S /A-9772-2008","Beckmann, Jacques S /0000-0002-9741-1900; Golzio, Christelle/0000-0002-4420-3921; Katsanis, Nicholas/0000-0002-2480-0171","Silvo O.

Clinical systems that achieve muscle contraction through functional electrical stimulation (FES) have proven to be effective in allowing patients with tetraplegia to regain control of hand movements and to achieve a greater measure of independence in daily activities(1,2). In existing clinical systems, the patient uses residual proximal limb movements to trigger pre-programmed stimulation that causes the paralysed muscles to contract, allowing use of one or two basic grasps. Instead, we have developed an FES system in primates that is controlled by recordings made from microelectrodes permanently implanted in the brain. We simulated some of the effects of the paralysis caused by C5 or C6 spinal cord injury(3) by injecting rhesus monkeys with a local anaesthetic to block the median and ulnar nerves at the elbow. Then, using recordings from approximately 100 neurons in the motor cortex, we predicted the intended activity of several of the paralysed muscles, and used these predictions to control the intensity of stimulation of the same muscles. This process essentially bypassed the spinal cord, restoring to the monkeys voluntary control of their paralysed muscles. This achievement is a major advance towards similar restoration of hand function in human patients through brain-controlled FES. We anticipate that in human patients, this neuroprosthesis would allow much more flexible and dexterous use of the hand than is possible with existing FES systems.","[Ethier, C.; Oby, E.

A neural interface system(1-5) could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices(6-8). Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm(9), but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.","[Hochberg, Leigh R.; Jarosiewicz, Beata; Simeral, John D.; Liu, Jie; Donoghue, John P.] Rehabil Res & Dev Serv, Dept Vet Affairs, Providence, RI 02908 USA; [Hochberg, Leigh R.; Bacher, Daniel; Simeral, John D.; Liu, Jie; Donoghue, John P.] Brown Univ, Sch Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Hochberg, Leigh R.; Bacher, Daniel; Jarosiewicz, Beata; Masse, Nicolas Y.; Simeral, John D.; Liu, Jie; Donoghue, John P.] Brown Univ, Inst Brain Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Hochberg, Leigh R.; Simeral, John D.; Cash, Sydney S.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Hochberg, Leigh R.; Cash, Sydney S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jarosiewicz, Beata; Masse, Nicolas Y.; Donoghue, John P.] Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Vogel, Joern; Haddadin, Sami; van der Smagt, Patrick] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Robot & Mechatron DLR Oberpfaffenhofen, D-82230 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany","Donoghue, JP (reprint author), Rehabil Res & Dev Serv, Dept Vet Affairs, Providence, RI 02908 USA.",leigh@brown.edu; john_donoghue@brown.edu,,"Vogel, Jorn/0000-0002-1987-0028; van der Smagt, Patrick/0000-0003-4418-4916; Hochberg, Leigh/0000-0003-0261-2273","Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, Office of Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs [B6453R, A6779I, B6310N]; National Institutes of Health: NINDS/NICHD [RC1HD063931]; NIDCD [R01DC009899]; NICHD-NCMRR [N01HD53403, N01HD10018]; NIBIB [R01EB007401]; NINDS-Javits [NS25074]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); Department of Veterans Affairs; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; MGH-Deane Institute for Integrated Research on Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke; Katie Samson Foundation; Craig H.

In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories(1). These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide(2). Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.","[Dixon, Jesse R.; Selvaraj, Siddarth; Yue, Feng; Kim, Audrey; Li, Yan; Shen, Yin; Ren, Bing] Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dixon, Jesse R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Med Scientist Training Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dixon, Jesse R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Selvaraj, Siddarth] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat & Syst Biol Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hu, Ming; Liu, Jun S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, UCSD Moores Canc Ctr, Inst Genom Med,Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Ren, B (reprint author), Ludwig Inst Canc Res, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",biren@ucsd.edu,,"Hu, Ming/0000-0002-6062-8794",Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [RN2-00905-1]; NIH [B.R.

A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C)(2) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.","[Nora, Elphege P.; Schulz, Edda G.; Giorgetti, Luca; Okamoto, Ikuhiro; Servant, Nicolas; Piolot, Tristan; Barillot, Emmanuel; Heard, Edith] Inst Curie, F-75248 Paris, France; [Nora, Elphege P.; Schulz, Edda G.; Giorgetti, Luca; Okamoto, Ikuhiro; Piolot, Tristan; Heard, Edith] CNRS, UMR3215, F-75248 Paris, France; [Nora, Elphege P.; Schulz, Edda G.; Giorgetti, Luca; Okamoto, Ikuhiro; Piolot, Tristan; Heard, Edith] INSERM, U934, F-75248 Paris, France; [Lajoie, Bryan R.; van Berkum, Nynke L.; Dekker, Job] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Programs Syst Biol & Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Servant, Nicolas; Barillot, Emmanuel] INSERM, U900, F-75248 Paris, France; [Servant, Nicolas; Barillot, Emmanuel] Mines ParisTech, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France; [Meisig, Johannes; Bluethgen, Nils] Charite, Inst Pathol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Meisig, Johannes; Bluethgen, Nils] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Sedat, John] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Gribnau, Joost] Univ Med Ctr, Erasmus MC, Dept Reprod & Dev, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands","Heard, E (reprint author), Inst Curie, 26 Rue Ulm, F-75248 Paris, France.",job.dekker@umassmed.edu; edith.heard@curie.fr,"Bluthgen, Nils/A-1711-2011; Heard, Edith/D-7197-2017","Bluthgen, Nils/0000-0002-0171-7447; Heard, Edith/0000-0001-8052-7117; Nora, Elphege/0000-0002-8347-4396",Ministere de la Recherche et de l'Enseignement Superieur; ARC; HFSP [LT000597/2010-L]; EU EpiGeneSys FP7 Network of Excellence [257082]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; ANR; ERC [250367]; EU [242129]; BMBF (FORSYS); EMBO [ASTF 307-2011]; NIH [R01 HG003143]; W.

Hence, there is a need for X-linked gene dosage compensation between XY males and XX females. In placental mammals, this is achieved by random inactivation of one X chromosome in all female somatic cells(1). Upregulation of Xist transcription on the future inactive X chromosome acts against Tsix antisense transcription, and spreading of Xist RNA in cis triggers epigenetic changes leading to X-chromosome inactivation. Previously, we have shown that the X-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF12 is upregulated in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells and activates Xist transcription and X-chromosome inactivation(2). Here we identify the pluripotency factor REX1 as a key target of RNF12 in the mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation. RNF12 causes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of REX1, and Rnf12 knockout embryonic stem cells show an increased level of REX1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, REX1 binding sites were detected in Xist and Tsix regulatory regions. Overexpression of REX1 in female embryonic stem cells was found to inhibit Xist transcription and X-chromosome inactivation, whereas male Rex1(+/-) embryonic stem cells showed ectopic X-chromosome inactivation. From this, we propose that RNF12 causes REX1 breakdown through dose-dependent catalysis, thereby representing an important pathway to initiate X-chromosome inactivation. Rex1 and Xist are present only in placental mammals, which points to co-evolution of these two genes and X-chromosome inactivation.","[Gontan, Cristina; Achame, Eskeatnaf Mulugeta; Barakat, Tahsin Stefan; Rentmeester, Eveline; Grootegoed, J.

Here we identify fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) as a critical transducer in this process in mice, and link its regulation to the nuclear receptor PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma), which is the adipocyte master regulator and the target of the thiazolidinedione class of insulin sensitizing drugs(3-5). FGF1 is the prototype of the 22-member FGF family of proteins and has been implicated in a range of physiological processes, including development, wound healing and cardiovascular changes(6). Surprisingly, FGF1 knockout mice display no significant phenotype under standard laboratory conditions(7-9). We show that FGF1 is highly induced in adipose tissue in response to a high-fat diet and that mice lacking FGF1 develop an aggressive diabetic phenotype coupled to aberrant adipose expansion when challenged with a high-fat diet. Further analysis of adipose depots in FGF1-deficient mice revealed multiple histopathologies in the vasculature network, an accentuated inflammatory response, aberrant adipocyte size distribution and ectopic expression of pancreatic lipases. On withdrawal of the high-fat diet, this inflamed adipose tissue fails to properly resolve, resulting in extensive fat necrosis. In terms of mechanisms, we show that adipose induction of FGF1 in the fed state is regulated by PPAR gamma acting through an evolutionarily conserved promoter proximal PPAR response element within the FGF1 gene. The discovery of a phenotype for the FGF1 knockout mouse establishes the PPAR gamma-FGF1 axis as critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitization.","[Jonker, Johan W.; Suh, Jae Myoung; Atkins, Annette R.; Ahmadian, Maryam; Whyte, Jamie; He, Mingxiao; Juguilon, Henry; Yin, Yun-Qiang; Phillips, Colin T.; Yu, Ruth T.; Downes, Michael; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Li, Pingping; Olefsky, Jerrold M.; Henry, Robert R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Henry, Robert R.] Vet Affairs San Diego Healthcare Syst, Sect Diabetes Metab, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Evans, RM (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",downes@salk.edu; evans@salk.edu,"Suh, Jae Myoung/B-3268-2015","Jonker, Johan/0000-0002-3919-5437; Li, Pingping/0000-0003-0679-270X","National Institutes of Health [DK062434, DK057978, DK090962, DK063491, HL105278]; Helmsley Charitable Trust; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); EU [IRG-277169]; NIDDK","We thank J.

Unlike the 'classical' opioid receptors, delta, kappa and mu (delta-OR, kappa-OR and mu-OR), which were delineated by pharmacological criteria in the 1970s and 1980s, the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (NOP, also known as ORL-1) was discovered relatively recently by molecular cloning and characterization of an orphan GPCR(1). Although it shares high sequence similarity with classical opioid GPCR subtypes (similar to 60%), NOP has a markedly distinct pharmacology, featuring activation by the endogenous peptide N/OFQ, and unique selectivity for exogenous ligands(2,3). Here we report the crystal structure of human NOP, solved in complex with the peptide mimetic antagonist compound-24 (C-24) (ref. 4), revealing atomic details of ligand-receptor recognition and selectivity. Compound-24 mimics the first four amino-terminal residues of the NOP-selective peptide antagonist UFP-101, a close derivative of N/OFQ, and provides important clues to the binding of these peptides. The X-ray structure also shows substantial conformational differences in the pocket regions between NOP and the classical opioid receptors k (ref. 5) and m (ref. 6), and these are probably due to a small number of residues that vary between these receptors. The NOP-compound-24 structure explains the divergent selectivity profile of NOP and provides a new structural template for the design of NOP ligands.","[Thompson, Aaron A.; Liu, Wei; Chun, Eugene; Katritch, Vsevolod; Wu, Huixian; Cherezov, Vadim; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Vardy, Eyal; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill Med Sch, Natl Inst Mental Hlth Psychoact Drug Screening Pr, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Vardy, Eyal; Huang, Xi-Ping; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill Med Sch, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Trapella, Claudio; Guerrini, Remo] Univ Ferrara, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Trapella, Claudio; Guerrini, Remo] Univ Ferrara, LTTA, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Calo, Girolamo] Univ Ferrara, Pharmacol Sect, Dept Expt & Clin Med, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Calo, Girolamo] Univ Ferrara, Natl Inst Neurosci, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy","Stevens, RC (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",stevens@scripps.edu,"; Cherezov, Vadim/L-9812-2013; Trapella, Claudio/I-2128-2012; Wu, Huixian/N-6353-2014; Roth, Bryan/F-3928-2010; Katritch, Vsevolod/Q-8357-2016","Katritch, Vsevolod/0000-0003-3883-4505; Cherezov, Vadim/0000-0002-5265-3914; Trapella, Claudio/0000-0002-6666-143X; Wu, Huixian/0000-0003-1357-9747; Guerrini, Remo/0000-0002-7619-0918","PSI:Biology [U54 GM094618]; NIH [P50 GM073197, R01 DA017204, R01 DA27170]; NIMH; Michael Hooker Chair of Pharmacology; University of Ferrara (FAR); Italian Ministry of University (FIRB); National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [Y1-GM-1104]","This work was supported by PSI:Biology grant U54 GM094618 for biological studies and structure production, NIH Roadmap grant P50 GM073197 for technology development and R01 DA017204, R01 DA27170, and the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program(X.-P.

They belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and are excellent therapeutic targets for pain control. The delta-opioid receptor (delta-OR) has a role in analgesia, as well as in other neurological functions that remain poorly understood(1). The structures of the mu-OR and kappa-OR have recently been solved(2,3). Here we report the crystal structure of the mouse d delta-OR, bound to the subtype-selective antagonist naltrindole. Together with the structures of the mu-OR and kappa-OR, the delta-OR structure provides insights into conserved elements of opioid ligand recognition while also revealing structural features associated with ligand-subtype selectivity. The binding pocket of opioid receptors can be divided into two distinct regions. Whereas the lower part of this pocket is highly conserved among opioid receptors, the upper part contains divergent residues that confer subtype selectivity. This provides a structural explanation and validation for the 'message-address' model of opioid receptor pharmacology(4,5), in which distinct 'message' (efficacy) and 'address' (selectivity) determinants are contained within a single ligand. Comparison of the address region of the delta-OR with other GPCRs reveals that this structural organization may be a more general phenomenon, extending to other GPCR families as well.","[Granier, Sebastien; Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Granier, Sebastien] CNRS, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] INSERM, U661, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier I, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Granier, S (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",granier@stanford.edu; kobilka@stanford.edu,"Weis, William/G-1437-2011; Granier, Sebastien/J-1089-2016","Weis, William/0000-0002-5583-6150; ","INSERM; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, DA031418]; Mathers Foundation","We thank R.

Despite the biological and therapeutic significance, the molecular mechanism of R-spondin action remains unclear. Here we show that the cell-surface transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) and its homologue ring finger 43 (RNF43) are negative feedback regulators of Wnt signalling. ZNRF3 is associated with the Wnt receptor complex, and inhibits Wnt signalling by promoting the turnover of frizzled and LRP6. Inhibition of ZNRF3 enhances Wnt/beta-catenin signalling and disrupts Wnt/ planar cell polarity signalling in vivo. Notably, R-spondin mimics ZNRF3 inhibition by increasing the membrane level of Wnt receptors. Mechanistically, R-spondin interacts with the extracellular domain of ZNRF3 and induces the association between ZNRF3 and LGR4, which results in membrane clearance of ZNRF3. These data suggest that R-spondin enhances Wnt signalling by inhibiting ZNRF3. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into the regulation of Wnt receptor turnover, and reveals ZNRF3 as a tractable target for therapeutic exploration.","[Hao, Huai-Xiang; Xie, Yang; Zhang, Yue; Charlat, Olga; Oster, Emma; Avello, Monika; Lei, Hong; Mickanin, Craig; Liu, Dong; Mao, Xiaohong; Ma, Qicheng; Zamponi, Raffaella; Finan, Peter M.; Porter, Jeffery A.; Serluca, Fabrizio C.; Cong, Feng] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ruffner, Heinz; Bouwmeester, Tewis] Novartis Pharma AG, Novartis Inst Biomed Res, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Kirschner, Marc W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Cong, F (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, 250 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",feng.cong@novartis.com,,,,,,37,261,279,3,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-May,2012,485,7397,,,,,195,U76,,10.1038/nature11019,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,939HJ,WOS:000303799800032,22575959,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Although biochemical studies indicate that N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks-around stop codons and within long internal exons-and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.","[Dominissini, Dan; Moshitch-Moshkovitz, Sharon; Salmon-Divon, Mali; Osenberg, Sivan; Cesarkas, Karen; Jacob-Hirsch, Jasmine; Amariglio, Ninette; Rechavi, Gideon] Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Res Ctr, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Dominissini, Dan; Ungar, Lior; Osenberg, Sivan; Rechavi, Gideon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Schwartz, Schraga; Sorek, Rotem] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Ungar, Lior; Kupiec, Martin] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Biotechnol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Rechavi, G (reprint author), Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Canc Res Ctr, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel.",Gidi.Rechavi@sheba.health.gov.il,,"Schwartz, Schraga/0000-0002-3671-9709; Dominissini, Dan/0000-0003-1121-5130",Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI); Bio-Med Morasha ISF [1942/08]; Israel Ministry for Science and Technology; ERC-StG [260432],"We thank H.

The seven P2X receptor subtypes are implicated in physiological processes that include modulation of synaptic transmission, contraction of smooth muscle, secretion of chemical transmitters and regulation of immune responses. Despite the importance of P2X receptors in cellular physiology, the three-dimensional composition of the ATP-binding site, the structural mechanism of ATP-dependent ion channel gating and the architecture of the open ion channel pore are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X(4) receptor in complex with ATP and a new structure of the apo receptor. The agonist-bound structure reveals a previously unseen ATP-binding motif and an open ion channel pore. ATP binding induces cleft closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket, flexing of the lower body beta-sheet and a radial expansion of the extracellular vestibule. The structural widening of the extracellular vestibule is directly coupled to the opening of the ion channel pore by way of an iris-like expansion of the transmembrane helices. The structural delineation of the ATP-binding site and the ion channel pore, together with the conformational changes associated with ion channel gating, will stimulate development of new pharmacological agents.","[Hattori, Motoyuki; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,"Hattori, Motoyuki/B-6069-2014",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; American Asthma Foundation; NIH,"We thank C.

It is widely suspected, but unproved, that the tight correlation between the mass of the black hole and the mass of the stellar bulge(1) results from the AGN quenching the surrounding star formation as it approaches its peak luminosity(2-4). X-rays trace emission from AGN unambiguously(5), whereas powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and are brightest at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths(6). Here we report submillimetre and X-ray observations that show that rapid star formation was common in the host galaxies of AGN when the Universe was 2-6 billion years old, but that the most vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an X-ray luminosity of 10(44) ergs per second. This suppression of star formation in the host galaxy of a powerful AGN is a key prediction of models in which the AGN drives an outflow(7-9), expelling the interstellar medium of its host and transforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.","[Page, M.

Previous candidate flares(2-6) have had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two 'relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet(7-10). Here we report a luminous ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core.","[Gezari, S.; Heckman, T.; Norman, C.; Scolnic, D.; Riess, A.

However, closer examination of cracking phenomena has revealed exquisitely intricate patterns such as spirals(4), oscillating(5,6,7) and branched(7) fracture paths and fractal geometries(8). Here we demonstrate the controlled initiation, propagation and termination of a variety of channelled crack patterns in a film/substrate system(9-11) comprising a silicon nitride thin film deposited on a silicon substrate using low-pressure chemical vapour deposition. Micro-notches etched into the silicon substrate concentrated stress for crack initiation, which occurred spontaneously during deposition of the silicon nitride layer. We reproducibly created three distinct crack morphologies-straight, oscillatory and orderly bifurcated (stitchlike)-through careful selection of processing conditions and parameters. We induced direction changes by changing the system parameters, and we terminated propagation at preformed multi-step crack stops. We believe that our patterning technique presents new opportunities in nanofabrication and offers a starting point for atomic-scale pattern formation(12), which would be difficult even with current state-of-the-art nanofabrication methodologies.","[Nam, Koo Hyun; Park, Il H.] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Phys, Res Ctr MEMS Space Telescope, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Ko, Seung Hwan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Appl Nano Technol & Sci Lab, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Nam, KH (reprint author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Phys, Res Ctr MEMS Space Telescope, Daehyun Dong 11-1, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",koonam@namk.org; maxko@kaist.ac.kr,"Ko, Seung Hwan/B-5448-2008; Ko, Seung Hwan/C-2043-2011","Ko, Seung Hwan/0000-0002-7477-0820; Nam, Koo Hyun/0000-0001-8069-7968",Creative Research Initiatives (Research Center of MEMS Space Telescope) of MEST/NRF,"This research was supported by Creative Research Initiatives (Research Center of MEMS Space Telescope) of MEST/NRF.

At this boundary, warm circumpolar water can override the continental slope front, reaching the grounding line(1,2) through submarine glacial troughs and causing high rates of melting at the deep ice-shelf bases(3,4). The interplay between ocean currents and continental bathymetry is therefore likely to influence future rates of ice-mass loss. Here we show that a redirection of the coastal current into the Filchner Trough and underneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf during the second half of the twenty-first century would lead to increased movement of warm waters into the deep southern ice-shelf cavity. Water temperatures in the cavity would increase by more than 2 degrees Celsius and boost average basal melting from 0.2 metres, or 82 billion tonnes, per year to almost 4 metres, or 1,600 billion tonnes, per year. Our results, which are based on the output of a coupled ice-ocean model forced by a range of atmospheric outputs from the HadCM3(5) climate model, suggest that the changes would be caused primarily by an increase in ocean surface stress in the southeastern Weddell Sea due to thinning of the formerly consolidated sea-ice cover. The projected ice loss at the base of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf represents 80 per cent of the present Antarctic surface mass balance(6).

Organic farming-a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, animals or humans-is often proposed as a solution(3,4). However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and bio-diversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices(5). Here we use a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming systems globally. Our analysis of available data shows that, overall, organic yields are typically lower than conventional yields. But these yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics, and range from 5% lower organic yields (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak-acidic to weak-alkaline soils), 13% lower yields (when best organic practices are used), to 34% lower yields (when the conventional and organic systems are most comparable). Under certain conditions-that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions-organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.","[Seufert, Verena; Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H2T 3A3, Canada; [Seufert, Verena; Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Global Environm & Climate Change Ctr, Montreal, PQ H2T 3A3, Canada; [Foley, Jonathan A.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm IonE, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Seufert, V (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H2T 3A3, Canada.",verena.seufert@mail.mcgill.ca,,"Seufert, Verena/0000-0003-2975-5856; Ramankutty, Navin/0000-0002-3737-5717",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We are grateful to the authors of the 66 studies whose extensive field work provided the data for this meta-analysis.

How the auditory system manages to extract intelligible speech under such acoustically complex and adverse listening conditions is not known, and, indeed, it is not clear how attended speech is internally represented(4,5). Here, using multi-electrode surface recordings from the cortex of subjects engaged in a listening task with two simultaneous speakers, we demonstrate that population responses in non-primary human auditory cortex encode critical features of attended speech: speech spectrograms reconstructed based on cortical responses to the mixture of speakers reveal the salient spectral and temporal features of the attended speaker, as if subjects were listening to that speaker alone. A simple classifier trained solely on examples of single speakers can decode both attended words and speaker identity. We find that task performance is well predicted by a rapid increase in attention-modulated neural selectivity across both single-electrode and population-level cortical responses. These findings demonstrate that the cortical representation of speech does not merely reflect the external acoustic environment, but instead gives rise to the perceptual aspects relevant for the listener's intended goal.","[Mesgarani, Nima; Chang, Edward F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Mesgarani, Nima; Chang, Edward F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Chang, EF (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",changed@neurosurg.ucsf.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R00-NS065120, DP2-OD00862, R01-DC012379]; Ester A. and Joseph Klingenstein Foundation","The authors would like to thank A.

But whereas de novo single nucleotide variants have been identified in affected individuals(4), their contribution to risk has yet to be clarified. Specifically, the frequency and distribution of these mutations have not been well characterized in matched unaffected controls, and such data are vital to the interpretation of de novo coding mutations observed in probands. Here we show, using whole-exome sequencing of 928 individuals, including 200 phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, that highly disruptive (nonsense and splice-site) de novo mutations in brain-expressed genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and carry large effects. On the basis of mutation rates in unaffected individuals, we demonstrate that multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants in the same gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles, providing a clear path forward for gene discovery. Among a total of 279 identified de novo coding mutations, there is a single instance in probands, and none in siblings, in which two independent nonsense variants disrupt the same gene, SCN2A (sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II, alpha subunit), a result that is highly unlikely by chance.","[Sanders, Stephan J.; Murtha, Michael T.; Murdoch, John D.; Raubeson, Melanie J.; Willsey, A.

To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3%) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivityamong themselves and to previous ASD genes(3) as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case-control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors.","[Neale, Benjamin M.; Samocha, Kaitlin E.; Lim, Elaine; Rossin, Elizabeth; Kirby, Andrew; Fromer, Menachem; Daly, Mark J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Analyt & Translat Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Neale, Benjamin M.; Samocha, Kaitlin E.; Lim, Elaine; Rossin, Elizabeth; Kirby, Andrew; Fromer, Menachem; Daly, Mark J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Neale, Benjamin M.; Samocha, Kaitlin E.; Stevens, Christine; Polak, Paz; Maguire, Jared; Voight, Benjamin F.; Lim, Elaine; Rossin, Elizabeth; Kirby, Andrew; Flannick, Jason; Fromer, Menachem; Shakir, Khalid; Fennell, Tim; Garimella, Kiran; Banks, Eric; Poplin, Ryan; Gabriel, Stacey; DePristo, Mark; Sunyaev, Shamil; Daly, Mark J.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kou, Yan; Ma'ayan, Avi; Dannenfelser, Ruth] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Kou, Yan; Makarov, Vladimir; Yoon, Seungtai; Cai, Guiqing; Lihm, Jayon; Buxbaum, Joseph D.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Seaver Autism Ctr Res & Treatment, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Liu, Li; Schafer, Chad; Roeder, Kathryn] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA; [Sabo, Aniko; Nagaswamy, Uma; Muzny, Donna; Reid, Jeffrey G.; Newsham, Irene; Wu, Yuanqing; Lewis, Lora; Han, Yi; Boerwinkle, Eric; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Makarov, Vladimir; Yoon, Seungtai; Cai, Guiqing; Lihm, Jayon; Buxbaum, Joseph D.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Polak, Paz; Sunyaev, Shamil] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Polak, Paz; Sunyaev, Shamil] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Crawford, Emily L.; Campbell, Nicholas G.; Sutcliffe, James S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Crawford, Emily L.; Campbell, Nicholas G.; Sutcliffe, James S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Dept Psychiat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Liu, Han; Zhao, Tuo] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Liu, Han; Zhao, Tuo] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Jabado, Omar; Peralta, Zuleyma; Buxbaum, Joseph D.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Voight, Benjamin F.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wimbish, Jack R.; Boone, Braden E.; Levy, Shawn E.] HudsonAlpha Inst Biotechnol, Huntsville, AL 35806 USA; [Betancur, Catalina] INSERM, U952, F-75005 Paris, France; [Betancur, Catalina] CNRS, UMR 7224, F-75005 Paris, France; [Betancur, Catalina] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Boerwinkle, Eric] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Human Genet Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Buxbaum, Joseph D.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Cook, Edwin H., Jr.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60608 USA; [Devlin, Bernie] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Daly, MJ (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Analyt & Translat Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",joseph.buxbaum@mssm.edu; kathryn.roeder@gmail.com; mjdaly@atgu.mgh.harvard.edu,"Fromer, Menachem/G-2116-2012; Sutcliffe, James/C-1348-2012; Liu, Li/G-1897-2015; Betancur, Catalina/K-3791-2017","Fromer, Menachem/0000-0003-3749-4342; Sutcliffe, James/0000-0001-5200-6007; Betancur, Catalina/0000-0002-3327-4804; Valladares, Otto/0000-0001-8055-2187; Geller, Evan/0000-0002-8035-8736; Buxbaum, Joseph/0000-0001-8898-8313","NIH [R01MH089208, R01 MH089025, R01 MH089004, R01MH089175, R01 MH089482, P50 HD055751, RO1 MH057881, R01 MH061009]; Seaver Foundation; NIH NCRR [UL1 RR024975]; Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development [P30 HD015052];  [R01MH084676];  [U54 HG003273];  [U54 HG003067]","This work was directly supported by NIH grants R01MH089208 (M.J.D.), R01 MH089025 (J.D.B.), R01 MH089004 (G.

Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes-so-called sporadic or simplex families(2,3)-we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent-child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported(4). Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 531) and previously reported trios (n = 19)(4), for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD(5). Moreover, 39% (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected beta-catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics.","[O'Roak, Brian J.; Vives, Laura; Girirajan, Santhosh; Karakoc, Emre; Krumm, Niklas; Coe, Bradley P.; Levy, Roie; Ko, Arthur; Lee, Choli; Smith, Joshua D.; Turner, Emily H.; Stanaway, Ian B.; Vernot, Benjamin; Malig, Maika; Baker, Carl; Akey, Joshua M.; Borenstein, Elhanan; Rieder, Mark J.; Nickerson, Deborah A.; Shendure, Jay; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Reilly, Beau; Bernier, Raphael] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Borenstein, Elhanan] Univ Washington, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Borenstein, Elhanan] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Eichler, EE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",shendure@uw.edu; eee@gs.washington.edu,"Coe, Bradley/A-2878-2009","Turner, Emily/0000-0001-9040-9229; Shendure, Jay/0000-0002-1516-1865; O'Roak, Brian/0000-0002-4141-0095","Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) [137578, 191889]; NIH [HD065285]","We would like to thank and recognize the following ongoing studies that produced and provided exome variant calls for comparison: NHLBI Lung Cohort Sequencing Project (HL 1029230), NHLBI WHI Sequencing Project (HL 102924), NIEHS SNPs (HHSN273200800010C), NHLBI/NHGRI SeattleSeq (HL 094976), and the Northwest Genomics Center (HL102926).

Although infection with microorganisms is not involved in the development of heart failure in most cases, inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure(1). However, the mechanisms responsible for initiating and integrating inflammatory responses within the heart remain poorly defined. Mitochondria are evolutionary endosymbionts derived from bacteria and contain DNA similar to bacterial DNA(2-4). Mitochondria damaged by external haemodynamic stress are degraded by the autophagy/lysosome systemin cardiomyocytes(5). Here we show that mitochondrial DNA that escapes from autophagy cell-autonomously leads to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9-mediated inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes and is capable of inducing myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac-specific deletion of lysosomal deoxyribonuclease (DNase) II showed no cardiac phenotypes under baseline conditions, but increased mortality and caused severe myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy 10 days after treatment with pressure overload. Early in the pathogenesis, DNase II-deficient hearts showed infiltration of inflammatory cells and increased messenger RNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, with accumulation of mitochondrial DNA deposits in autolysosomes in the myocardium. Administration of inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides against TLR9, which is known to be activated by bacterial DNA(6), or ablation of Tlr9 attenuated the development of cardiomyopathy in DNase II-deficient mice. Furthermore, Tlr9 ablation improved pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction and inflammation even in mice with wild-type Dnase2a alleles. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanism of genesis of chronic inflammation in failing hearts.","[Oka, Takafumi; Hikoso, Shungo; Yamaguchi, Osamu; Taneike, Manabu; Takeda, Toshihiro; Tamai, Takahito; Oyabu, Jota; Murakawa, Tomokazu; Nishida, Kazuhiko; Komuro, Issei; Otsu, Kinya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Taneike, Manabu; Nishida, Kazuhiko; Otsu, Kinya] Kings Coll London, Div Cardiovasc, London SE5 9NU, England; [Nakayama, Hiroyuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Clin Pharmacol & Pharmacogen, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Host Def Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Dept Host Def, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yamamoto, Akitsugu] Nagahama Inst Biosci & Technol, Fac Biosci, Nagahama, Shiga 5260829, Japan","Otsu, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kinya.otsu@kcl.ac.uk,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan; Mitsubishi Pharma Research Foundation; British Heart Foundation [CH/11/3/29051, RG/11/12/29052]","We thank S.

The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 (ref. 5) mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that 'sialidase-sensitive' animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas 'sialidase-insensitive' human rotavirus strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1 (ref. 3). Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies(1,3,6,7), it is not yet known how VP8* of human rotaviruses interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. Here we show that VP8* of a human rotavirus strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-A-type antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in Chinese hamster ovary cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of human rotavirus. HBGAs are genetically determined glycoconjugates present in mucosal secretions, epithelia and on red blood cells(8), and are recognized as susceptibility and cell attachment factors for gastric pathogens like Helicobacter pylori(9) and noroviruses(10). Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the human rotavirus VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching. These results raise the possibility that host susceptibility to specific human rotavirus strains and pathogenesis are influenced by genetically controlled expression of different HBGAs among the world's population.","[Hu, Liya; Prasad, B.

Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis(1). Abundant scientific(2) and clinical evidence(1,3), including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors(4,5), suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and RET6,7; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.","[Smith, Catherine C.; Salerno, Sara; Damon, Lauren E.; Shah, Neil P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Qi; Kuriyan, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chin, Chen-Shan; Travers, Kevin J.; Wang, Susana; Schadt, Eric E.; Kasarskis, Andrew] Pacific Biosci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Levis, Mark J.] Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr Johns Hopkins, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Perl, Alexander E.] Univ Penn, Abramson Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hunt, Jeremy P.; Zarrinkar, Patrick P.] Ambit Biosci, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Shah, Neil P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA","Shah, NP (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",nshah@medicine.ucsf.edu,"Wang, Qi/H-9399-2012","Wang, Qi/0000-0002-9703-1676",Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; NCI Leukemia SPORE [P50 CA100632-06]; NCI [R01 CA12886]; NIH; Art and Alison Kern and the Edward S.

Despite recent efforts(1-3), the vast landscape of RNA regulatory elements remains largely uncharacterized. A long-standing obstacle is the contribution of local RNA secondary structure to the definition of interaction partners in a variety of regulatory contexts, including-but not limited to-transcript stability(3), alternative splicing(4) and localization(3). There are many documented instances where the presence of a structural regulatory element dictates alternative splicing patterns (for example, human cardiac troponin T) or affects other aspects of RNA biology(5). Thus, a full characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory programs requires capturing information provided by both local secondary structures and the underlying sequence(3,6). Here we present a computational framework based on context-free grammars(3,7) and mutual information(2) that systematically explores the immense space of small structural elements and reveals motifs that are significantly informative of genome-wide measurements of RNA behaviour. By applying this framework to genome-wide human mRNA stability data, we reveal eight highly significant elements with substantial structural information, for the strongest of which we show a major role in global mRNA regulation. Through biochemistry, mass spectrometry and in vivo binding studies, we identified human HNRPA2B1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, also known as HNRNPA2B1) as the key regulator that binds this element and stabilizes a large number of its target genes. We created a global post-transcriptional regulatory map based on the identity of the discovered linear and structural cis-regulatory elements, their regulatory interactions and their target pathways. This approach could also be used to reveal the structural elements that modulate other aspects of RNA behaviour.","[Goodarzi, Hani; Oikonomou, Panos; Tavazoie, Saeed] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Goodarzi, Hani; Oikonomou, Panos; Greco, Todd M.; Cristea, Ileana M.; Tavazoie, Saeed] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Najafabadi, Hamed S.; Salavati, Reza] McGill Univ, Inst Parasitol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Najafabadi, Hamed S.; Salavati, Reza] McGill Univ, McGill Ctr Bioinformat, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Fish, Lisa] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Syst Canc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Salavati, Reza] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Tavazoie, S (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",st2744@columbia.edu,"Greco, Todd/E-8279-2010; Oikonomou, Panos/J-5106-2014","Greco, Todd/0000-0002-5845-713X; Oikonomou, Panos/0000-0001-7387-0312; Najafabadi, Hamed/0000-0003-2735-4231; Goodarzi, Hani/0000-0002-9648-8949",Ruth L.

Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure.

These results indicate that synthetic REV-ERB ligands that pharmacologically target the circadian rhythm may be beneficial in the treatment of sleep disorders as well as metabolic diseases.","[Solt, Laura A.; Wang, Yongjun; Banerjee, Subhashis; Hughes, Travis; Kojetin, Douglas J.; Lundasen, Thomas; Liu, Jin; Burris, Thomas P.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Shin, Youseung; Cameron, Michael D.; Noel, Romain; Kamenecka, Theodore M.] Scripps Res Inst, Translat Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Yoo, Seung-Hee; Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Yoo, Seung-Hee; Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Butler, Andrew A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Metab & Aging, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Burris, Thomas P.] Scripps Res Inst, Ctr Diabet & Metab Dis, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Burris, TP (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",tburris@scripps.edu,"Takahashi, Joseph/E-8482-2012; Burris, Thomas/B-3886-2016","Takahashi, Joseph/0000-0003-0384-8878; Burris, Thomas/0000-0003-2922-4449","National Institutes of Health [DK080201, MH092769, DK089984]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; individual National Research Service Award [DK088499]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants (DK080201, MH092769 and DK089984) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Osteoprotegerin protects bone by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption, but no factor has yet been identified as a local determinant of bone mass that regulates both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Here we show that semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) exerts an osteoprotective effect by both suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption and increasing osteoblastic bone formation. The binding of Sema3A to neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and RhoA signalling pathways. In addition, Sema3A and Nrp1 binding stimulated osteoblast and inhibited adipocyte differentiation through the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. The osteopenic phenotype in Sema3a(-/-) mice was recapitulated by mice in which the Sema3A-binding site of Nrp1 had been genetically disrupted. Intravenous Sema3A administration in mice increased bone volume and expedited bone regeneration. Thus, Sema3A is a promising new therapeutic agent in bone and joint diseases.","[Hayashi, Mikihito; Nakashima, Tomoki; Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Cell Signaling, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Hayashi, Mikihito; Nakashima, Tomoki; Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Exploratory Res Adv Technol Program, Takayanagi Osteonetwork Project, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Hayashi, Mikihito; Nakashima, Tomoki; Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Int Res Ctr Mol Sci Tooth & Bone Dis, Global Ctr Excellence Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Taniguchi, Masahiko] Sapporo Med Univ, Sch Med, Res Inst Frontier Med, Dept Mol Med Sci,Chuo Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608556, Japan; [Kodama, Tatsuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Mol Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Lab Syst Biol & Med,Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Kumanogoh, Atsushi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Resp Med Allergy & Rheumat Dis, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kumanogoh, Atsushi] Osaka Univ, Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Dept Immunopathol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Univ Western Australia, Sch Surg, Ctr Orthopaed Res, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia","Takayanagi, H (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Cell Signaling, Bunkyo Ku, Yushima 1-5-45, Tokyo 1138549, Japan.",taka.csi@tmd.ac.jp,,,"Japan Science and Technology Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Tokyo Biochemical Research Foundation; Life Science Foundation of Japan; Takeda Science Foundation; Uehara Memorial Foundation; Naito Foundation; BMKK RA; Astellas Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders","We are grateful to D.

Earth's impact history is inferred therefore either from estimates of the present-day impactor flux as determined by observations of near-Earth asteroids, or from the Moon's incomplete impact chronology(2-4). Asteroids hitting Earth typically vaporize a mass of target rock comparable to the projectile's mass. As this vapour expands in a large plume or fireball, it cools and condenses into molten droplets called spherules(5). For asteroids larger than about ten kilometres in diameter, these spherules are deposited in a global layer. Spherule layers preserved in the geologic record accordingly provide information about an impact even when the source crater cannot be found(1). Here we report estimates of the sizes and impact velocities of the asteroids that created global spherule layers. The impact chronology from these spherule layers reveals that the impactor flux was significantly higher 3.5 billion years ago than it is now. This conclusion is consistent with a gradual decline of the impactor flux after the Late Heavy Bombardment.","[Johnson, B. C.; Melosh, H.

Many assume the LHB ended about 3.7 to 3.8 billion years (Gyr) ago with the formation of Orientale basin(2,3). Evidence for LHB-sized blasts on Earth, however, extend into the Archaean and early Proterozoic eons, in the form of impact spherule beds: globally distributed ejecta layers created by Chicxulub-sized or larger cratering events(4). At least seven spherule beds have been found that formed between 3.23 and 3.47 Gyr ago, four between 2.49 and 2.63 Gyr ago, and one between 1.7 and 2.1 Gyr ago(5-9). Here we report that the LHB lasted much longer than previously thought, with most late impactors coming from the E belt, an extended and now largely extinct portion of the asteroid belt between 1.7 and 2.1 astronomical units from Earth. This region was destabilized by late giant planet migration(10-13). E-belt survivors now make up the high-inclination Hungaria asteroids(14,15). Scaling from the observed Hungaria asteroids, we find that E-belt projectiles made about ten lunar basins between 3.7 and 4.1 Gyr ago. They also produced about 15 terrestrial basins between 2.5 and 3.7 Gyr ago, as well as around 70 and four Chicxulub-sized or larger craters on the Earth and Moon, respectively, between 1.7 and 3.7 Gyr ago. These rates reproduce impact spherule bed and lunar crater constraints.","[Bottke, William F.; Vokrouhlicky, David; Minton, David; Nesvorny, David; Morbidelli, Alessandro; Brasser, Ramon; Levison, Harold F.] SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Bottke, William F.; Vokrouhlicky, David; Minton, David; Nesvorny, David; Morbidelli, Alessandro; Brasser, Ramon; Levison, Harold F.] NASA, Lunar Sci Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Vokrouhlicky, David] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Astron, CR-18000 Prague 8, Czech Republic; [Minton, David] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Morbidelli, Alessandro; Brasser, Ramon] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, Lab Cassiopee, F-06304 Nice 4, France; [Brasser, Ramon] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Simonson, Bruce] Oberlin Coll, Dept Geol, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA","Bottke, WF (reprint author), SW Res Inst, 1050 Walnut St,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",bottke@boulder.swri.edu,,,University of Hawaii; NASA's Lunar Science Institute (Center for Lunar Origin and Evolution) [NNA09DB32A]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic; Germany's Helmholtz Alliance; NASA [NNX08AI29G]; NASA through the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at Ames Research Center,"We thank B.

When binding to the atomic nucleus, it also acquires an angular momentum quantum number corresponding to the quantized atomic orbital it occupies. Even if electrons in solids form bands and delocalize from the nuclei, in Mott insulators they retain their three fundamental quantum numbers: spin, charge and orbital(1). The hallmark of one-dimensional physics is a breaking up of the elementary electron into its separate degrees of freedom(2). The separation of the electron into independent quasi-particles that carry either spin (spinons) or charge (holons) was first observed fifteen years ago(3). Here we report observation of the separation of the orbital degree of freedom (orbiton) using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering on the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr2CuO3. We resolve an orbiton separating itself from spinons and propagating through the lattice as a distinct quasi-particle with a substantial dispersion in energy over momentum, of about 0.2 electronvolts, over nearly one Brillouin zone.","[Schlappa, J.; Zhou, K.

Such control has been achieved through topography, chemistry and the adsorption of monolayers or surfactants(2,3). The role of the substrate or interface has been to impart order over visible length scales and to confine the liquid crystal in a device. Here, we report results from a computational study of a liquid-crystal-based system in which the opposite is true: the liquid crystal is used to impart order on the interfacial arrangement of a surfactant. Recent experiments on macroscopic interfaces have hinted that an interfacial coupling between bulk liquid crystal and surfactant can lead to a two-dimensional phase separation of the surfactant at the interface(4), but have not had the resolution to measure the structure of the resulting phases. To enhance that coupling, we consider the limit of nanodroplets, the interfaces of which are decorated with surfactant molecules that promote local perpendicular orientation of mesogens within the droplet. In the absence of surfactant, mesogens at the interface are all parallel to that interface. As the droplet is cooled, the mesogens undergo a transition from a disordered (isotropic) to an ordered (nematic or smectic) liquid-crystal phase. As this happens, mesogens within the droplet cause a transition of the surfactant at the interface, which forms new ordered nanophases with morphologies dependent on surfactant concentration. Such nanophases are reminiscent of those encountered in block copolymers(5), and include circular, striped and worm-like patterns.","[Abbott, N. L.; de Pablo, J.

Accurate knowledge of sound velocities in the lower-mantle minerals under relevant high-pressure, high-temperature conditions is essential in constraining the mineralogy and chemical composition using seismological observations(1), but previous acoustic measurements were limited to a range of low pressures and temperatures. Here we determine the shear-wave velocities for silicate perovskite and ferropericlase under the pressure and temperature conditions of the deep lower mantle using Brillouin scattering spectroscopy(2). The mineralogical model that provides the best fit to a global seismic velocity profile(1) indicates that perovskite constitutes more than 93 per cent by volume of the lower mantle, which is a much higher proportion than that predicted by the conventional peridotitic mantle model. It suggests that the lower mantle is enriched in silicon relative to the upper mantle, which is consistent with the chondritic Earth model.

This principle has been challenged by long-standing theoretical models predicting that selection could modulate the rate of mutation itself(1,2). However, our understanding of how the mutation rate varies between different sites within a genome has been hindered by technical difficulties in measuring it. Here we present a study that overcomes previous limitations by combining phylogenetic and population genetic techniques. Upon comparing 34 Escherichia coli genomes, we observe that the neutral mutation rate varies by more than an order of magnitude across 2,659 genes, with mutational hot and cold spots spanning several kilobases. Importantly, the variation is not random: we detect a lower rate in highly expressed genes and in those undergoing stronger purifying selection. Our observations suggest that the mutation rate has been evolutionarily optimized to reduce the risk of deleterious mutations. Current knowledge of factors influencing the mutation rate-including transcription-coupled repair and context-dependent mutagenesis-do not explain these observations, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved. The findings have important implications for our understanding of evolution and the control of mutations.","[Martincorena, Inigo; Seshasayee, Aswin S.

Although transplanted rod-precursor cells are able to migrate into the adult retina and differentiate to acquire the specialized morphological features of mature photoreceptor cells(1), the fundamental question remains whether transplantation of photoreceptor cells can actually improve vision. Here we provide evidence of functional rod-mediated vision after photoreceptor transplantation in adult Gnat1(-/-) mice, which lack rod function and are a model of congenital stationary night blindness(2). We show that transplanted rod precursors form classic triad synaptic connections with second-order bipolar and horizontal cells in the recipient retina. The newly integrated photoreceptor cells are light-responsive with dim-flash kinetics similar to adult wild-type photoreceptors. By using intrinsic imaging under scotopic conditions we demonstrate that visual signals generated by transplanted rods are projected to higher visual areas, including V1. Moreover, these cells are capable of driving optokinetic head tracking and visually guided behaviour in the Gnat1(-/-) mouse under scotopic conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of photoreceptor transplantation as a therapeutic strategy for restoring vision after retinal degeneration.","[Pearson, R. A.; Barber, A.

These cells often reside in specific signalling niches that orchestrate the stem cell's balancing act between quiescence and cell-cycle re-entry based on the demand for tissue regeneration(2-4). How stem cells maintain their capacity to replenish themselves after tissue regeneration is poorly understood. Here we use RNA-interference-based loss-of-function screening as a powerful approach to uncover transcriptional regulators that govern the self-renewal capacity and regenerative potential of stem cells. Hair follicle stem cells provide an ideal model. These cells have been purified and characterized from their native niche in vivo and, in contrast to their rapidly dividing progeny, they can be maintained and passaged long-term in vitro(5-7). Focusing on the nuclear proteins and/or transcription factors that are enriched in stem cells compared with their progeny(5,6), we screened similar to 2,000 short hairpin RNAs for their effect on long-term, but not short-term, stem cell self-renewal in vitro. To address the physiological relevance of our findings, we selected one candidate that was uncovered in the screen: TBX1. This transcription factor is expressed in many tissues but has not been studied in the context of stem cell biology. By conditionally ablating Tbx1 in vivo, we showed that during homeostasis, tissue regeneration occurs normally but is markedly delayed. We then devised an in vivo assay for stem cell replenishment and found that when challenged with repetitive rounds of regeneration, the Tbx1-deficient stem cell niche becomes progressively depleted. Addressing the mechanism of TBX1 action, we discovered that TBX1 acts as an intrinsic rheostat of BMP signalling: it is a gatekeeper that governs the transition between stem cell quiescence and proliferation in hair follicles. Our results validate the RNA interference screen and underscore its power in unearthing new molecules that govern stem cell self-renewal and tissue-regenerative potential.","[Chen, Ting; Heller, Evan; Beronja, Slobodan; Oshimori, Naoki; Stokes, Nicole; Fuchs, Elaine] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Fuchs, E (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",fuchs@rockefeller.edu,,,NYSTEM [C026722]; NYSDOH [C023046]; National Institutes of Health [R01-AR050452]; Empire State Stem Cell [NYSTEM N09G074]; New York Stem Cell Foundation,"We are grateful to A.

Here we use high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1 (ref. 2). Our data reveal a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost entirely of transcripts with established 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 and Ybx1, with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs that we identified. We find no evidence to support proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased 5' untranslated region length or complexity(3). mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA translation is unknown(4). Remarkably, loss of just the 4E-BP family of translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1 substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation resistant to Torin 1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E and eIF4G1. Loss of this interaction diminishes the capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their translation. Our results clarify the translational program controlled by mTORC1 and identify 4E-BPs and eIF4G1 as its master effectors.","[Thoreen, Carson C.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thoreen, Carson C.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thoreen, Carson C.; Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Gray, NS (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, 250 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",nathanael_gray@dfci.harvard.edu; sabatini@wi.mit.edu,,/0000-0002-1446-7256,"National Institutes of Health [CA103866, CA129105]; Department of Defense [W81XWH-07-0448]; W.M.

Together, PAMP-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity constitute powerful defences against various phytopathogens. Pathogenic bacteria inject a variety of effector proteins into the host cell to assist infection or propagation. A number of effector proteins have been shown to inhibit plant immunity(5), but the biochemical basis remains unknown for the vast majority of these effectors. Here we show that the Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris type III effector AvrAC enhances virulence and inhibits plant immunity by specifically targeting Arabidopsis BIK1 and RIPK, two receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases known to mediate immune signalling(6-8). AvrAC is a uridylyl transferase that adds uridine 5'-monophosphate to and conceals conserved phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of BIK1 and RIPK, reducing their kinase activity and consequently inhibiting downstream signalling.","[Feng, Feng; Yang, Fan; Wu, Xiaogang; Zhang, Jie; Chen, She; Zhou, Jian-Min] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Feng, Feng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Feng, Feng; He, Chaozu] Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Rong, Wei; He, Chaozu] Hainan Univ, Hainan Key Lab Sustainable Utilizat Trop Bioresou, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jian-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Genom, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jian-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Zhou, JM (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",czhe@hainu.edu.cn; zhoujianmin@nibs.ac.cn,,,"Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2011CB100700, 2010CB835301, 2010CB835204]; Hainan University","The authors thank J.

The distribution of auxin depends on both auxin metabolism (biosynthesis, conjugation and degradation)(8-10) and cellular auxin transport(11-15). We identified in silico a novel putative auxin transport facilitator family, called PIN-LIKES (PILS). Here we illustrate that PILS proteins are required for auxin-dependent regulation of plant growth by determining the cellular sensitivity to auxin. PILS proteins regulate intracellular auxin accumulation at the endoplasmic reticulum and thus auxin availability for nuclear auxin signalling. PILS activity affects the level of endogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), presumably via intracellular accumulation and metabolism. Our findings reveal that the transport machinery to compartmentalize auxin within the cell is of an unexpected molecular complexity and demonstrate this compartmentalization to be functionally important for a number of developmental processes.","[Barbez, Elke; Beziat, Chloe; Rosquete, Michel Ruiz; Friml, Jiri; Kleine-Vehn, Juergen] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Barbez, Elke; Beziat, Chloe; Rosquete, Michel Ruiz; Friml, Jiri; Kleine-Vehn, Juergen] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Bioinformat, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Barbez, Elke; Beziat, Chloe; Rosquete, Michel Ruiz; Kleine-Vehn, Juergen] Univ Nat Resources & Life Siences BOKU, Dept Appl Genet & Cell Biol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Kubes, Martin; Dobrev, Petre I.; Zazimalova, Eva; Petrasek, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Expt Bot, CR-16502 Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Rolcik, Jakub] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Lab Growth Regulators, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Rolcik, Jakub] Inst Expt Bot AS CR, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Pencik, Ales] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Growth Regulators, Ctr Reg Hana Biotechnol & Agr Res, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Wang, Bangjun; Zhu, Jinsheng; Geisler, Markus] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Plant Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Lee, Yuree] Univ Lausanne, Dept Plant Mol Biol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Kleine-Vehn, J (reprint author), Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",juergen.kleine-vehn@boku.ac.at,"Petrasek, Jan/C-8240-2009; Friml, Jiri/D-9511-2012; Kleine-Vehn, Jurgen/C-8984-2014; Kubes, Martin/F-9761-2014; Dobrev, Petre/H-2391-2014; Zazimalova, Eva/G-7432-2014; Geisler, Markus/B-3921-2012","Petrasek, Jan/0000-0002-6719-2735; Kleine-Vehn, Jurgen/0000-0002-4354-3756; Barbez, Elke/0000-0002-5531-7916","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF); Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT); Research Foundation-Flanders; Swiss National Funds; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LC06034]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P305/11/2476, P305/11/0797]","We are grateful to C.

Although the nuclear receptors REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta have been proposed to form an accessory feedback loop that contributes to clock function(1,2), their precise roles and importance remain unresolved. To establish their regulatory potential, we determined the genome-wide cis-acting targets (cistromes) of both REV-ERB isoforms in murine liver, which revealed shared recognition at over 50% of their total DNA binding sites and extensive overlap with the master circadian regulator BMAL1. Although REV-ERB-alpha has been shown to regulate Bmal1 expression directly(1,2), our cistromic analysis reveals a more profound connection between BMAL1 and the REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta genomic regulatory circuits than was previously suspected. Genes within the intersection of the BMAL1, REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta cistromes are highly enriched for both clock and metabolic functions. As predicted by the cistromic analysis, dual depletion of Rev-erb-alpha and Rev-erb-beta function by creating double-knockout mice profoundly disrupted circadian expression of core circadian clock and lipid homeostatic gene networks. As a result, double-knockout mice show markedly altered circadian wheel-running behaviour and deregulated lipid metabolism. These data now unite REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta with PER, CRY and other components of the principal feedback loop that drives circadian expression and indicate a more integral mechanism for the coordination of circadian rhythm and metabolism.","[Cho, Han; Zhao, Xuan; Yu, Ruth T.; Barish, Grant D.; Chong, Ling-Wa; Atkins, Annette R.; Downes, Michael; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hatori, Megumi; DiTacchio, Luciano; Panda, Satchidananda] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Regulatory Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lam, Michael T.; Glass, Christopher K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liddle, Christopher] Westmead Millennium Inst, Storr Liver Unit, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Liddle, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Westmead Hosp, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Auwerx, Johan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Evans, RM (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",evans@salk.edu,"DiTacchio, Luciano/D-6341-2011","DiTacchio, Luciano/0000-0001-9570-7348","National Research Service Award [T32-HL007770]; National Institutes of Health [DK062434, DK057978, DK090962, DK091618, HL105278]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [NHMRC 512354, 632886]; Helmsley Charitable Trust; Glenn Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank S.

Triggering of the cyclic AMP pathway increases gluconeogenic gene expression via the de-phosphorylation of the CREB co-activator CRTC2 (ref. 1). Glucagon promotes CRTC2 dephosphorylation in part through the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated inhibition of the CRTC2 kinase SIK2. A number of Ser/Thr phosphatases seem to be capable of dephosphorylating CRTC2 (refs 2, 3), but the mechanisms by which hormonal cues regulate these enzymes remain unclear. Here we show in mice that glucagon stimulates CRTC2 dephosphorylation in hepatocytes by mobilizing intracellular calcium stores and activating the calcium/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr-phosphatase calcineurin (also known as PP3CA). Glucagon increased cytosolic calcium concentration through the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)Rs), which associate with CRTC2. After their activation, InsP(3)Rs enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression by promoting the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of CRTC2. During feeding, increases in insulin signalling reduced CRTC2 activity via the AKT-mediated inactivation of InsP(3)Rs. InsP(3)R activity was increased in diabetes, leading to upregulation of the gluconeogenic program. As hepatic downregulation of InsP(3)Rs and calcineurin improved circulating glucose levels in insulin resistance, these results demonstrate how interactions between cAMP and calcium pathways at the level of the InsP(3)R modulate hepatic glucose production under fasting conditions and in diabetes.","[Wang, Yiguo; Goode, Jason; Paz, Jose C.; Fischer, Wolfgang H.; Montminy, Marc] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Clayton Fdn Labs Peptide Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Li, Gang; Tabas, Ira] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Ouyang, Kunfu; Chen, Ju] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Screaton, Robert] Univ Ottawa, Eastern Ontario Res Inst, Childrens Hosp, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Screaton, Robert] Univ Ottawa, Dept Pediat, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Screaton, Robert] Univ Ottawa, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Tabas, Ira] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Tabas, Ira] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Clayton Fdn Labs Peptide Biol, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",montminy@salk.edu,"ouyang, kunfu/B-3073-2011; Chen, Ju/E-5579-2011; Paz, Jose Carlos/I-5783-2015","ouyang, kunfu/0000-0003-0292-375X; Paz, Jose Carlos/0000-0001-9684-9735; Screaton, Robert/0000-0002-4917-9473","National Institutes of Health [R01-DK049777, R01-DK083834, R01-DK091618, HL087123]; Kieckhefer Foundation; Clayton Foundation for Medical Research; Leona M. and Harry B.

Many K+ channel proteins, after initial channel opening, show a time-dependent reduction in current flux, termed 'inactivation', which involves movement of mobile cytosolic peptide segments (approximately 20-30 residues) into a position that physically occludes ion permeation(6-8). Peptide segments that produce inactivation show little amino-acid identity(6,9-13) and tolerate appreciable mutational substitutions(13) without disrupting the inactivation process. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance of several isolated inactivation domains reveals substantial conformational heterogeneity with only minimal tendency to ordered structures(14-17). Channel inactivation mechanisms may therefore help us to decipher how intrinsically disordered regions mediate functional effects. Whereas many aspects of inactivation of voltage-dependent K+ channels (Kv) can be described by a simple one-step occlusion mechanism(6,7,18,19), inactivation of the voltage-dependent large-conductance Ca2+-gated K+ (BK) channel mediated by peptide segments of auxiliary beta-subunits involves two distinguishable kinetic steps(20,21). Here we show that two-step inactivation mediated by an intrinsically disordered BK beta-subunit peptide involves a stereospecific binding interaction that precedes blockade. In contrast, blocking mediated by a Shaker Kv inactivation peptide is consistent with direct, simple occlusion by a hydrophobic segment without substantial steric requirement. The results indicate that two distinct types of molecular interaction between disordered peptide segments and their binding sites produce qualitatively similar functions.","[Gonzalez-Perez, Vivian; Zeng, Xu-Hui; Lingle, Christopher J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Henzler-Wildman, Katie] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Lingle, CJ (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",clingle@morpheus.wustl.edu,,"Henzler-Wildman, Katherine/0000-0002-5295-2121",Searle Scholars Program;  [GM-081748],"This work was supported by GM-081748 to C.J.L. and the Searle Scholars Program to K.H.-W.

Layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex might participate in sensorimotor integration and learning; they receive input from sensory cortex and excite deep layer neurons, which control movement. Here we imaged activity in the same set of layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex over weeks, while mice learned to detect objects with their whiskers and report detection with licking. Spatially intermingled neurons represented sensory (touch) and motor behaviours (whisker movements and licking). With learning, the population-level representation of task-related licking strengthened. In trained mice, population-level representations were redundant and stable, despite dynamism of single-neuron representations. The activity of a subpopulation of neurons was consistent with touch driving licking behaviour. Our results suggest that ensembles of motor cortex neurons couple sensory input to multiple, related motor programs during learning.","[Huber, D.; Gutnisky, D. A.; Peron, S.; O'Connor, D.

The heart acquires muscle mass and matures structurally to fulfil increasing circulatory needs, a process that is incompletely understood. Here we used multicolour clonal analysis to define the contributions of individual cardiomyocytes as the zebrafish heart undergoes morphogenesis from a primitive embryonic structure into its complex adult form. We find that the single-cardiomyocyte-thick wall of the juvenile ventricle forms by lateral expansion of several dozen cardiomyocytes into muscle patches of variable sizes and shapes. As juvenile zebrafish mature into adults, this structure becomes fully enveloped by a new lineage of cortical muscle. Adult cortical muscle originates from a small number of cardiomyocytes-an average of approximately eight per animal-that display clonal dominance reminiscent of stem cell populations. Cortical cardiomyocytes initially emerge from internal myofibres that in rare events breach the juvenile ventricular wall, and then expand over the surface. Our results illuminate the dynamic proliferative behaviours that generate adult cardiac structure, revealing clonal dominance as a key mechanism that shapes a vertebrate organ.","[Gupta, Vikas; Poss, Kenneth D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Gupta, Vikas; Poss, Kenneth D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Poss, KD (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",kenneth.poss@duke.edu,,"Poss, Kenneth/0000-0002-6743-5709","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [HL081674]; American Heart Association","We thank K.

The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination(1), no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies(2). Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal(3-7), but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way(8). Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS(3D) sample(9) of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history.","[Cappellari, Michele; Bureau, M.; Davies, Roger L.; Davis, Timothy A.; Scott, Nicholas] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Subdept Astrophys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England; [McDermid, Richard M.] Gemini Observ, No Operat Ctr, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Alatalo, Katherine; Blitz, Leo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bois, Maxime] Observ Paris, LERMA, F-75014 Paris, France; [Bois, Maxime] CNRS, F-75014 Paris, France; [Bournaud, Frederic; Duc, Pierre-Alain] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, CEA IRFU SAp, Lab AIM Paris Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Crocker, Alison F.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Astrophys, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Davis, Timothy A.; de Zeeuw, P.

However, many properties of exotic, strongly correlated spin systems, such as spin liquids, have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N approximate to 30 particles(3). Feynman predicted that a quantum simulator-a special-purpose 'analogue' processor built using quantum bits (qubits)-would be inherently suited to solving such problems(4,5). In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach(6-14), but simulations allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on two- or three-dimensional lattices of more than a few tens of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, in part because of the technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction, J(i,j), on a naturally occurring, two-dimensional triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-half particles (beryllium ions stored in a Penning trap). This is a computationally relevant scale more than an order of magnitude larger than previous experiments. We show that a spin-dependent optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J(i,j) proportional to d(i,j)(-a), where 0 <= a <= 3 and d(i,j) is the distance between spin pairs. These power laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a = 0), Coulomb-like (a = 1), monopole-dipole (a = 2) and dipole-dipole (a = 3) couplings. Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with a theory for 0.05 less than or similar to a less than or similar to 1.4. This demonstration, coupled with the high spin count, excellent quantum control and low technical complexity of the Penning trap, brings within reach the simulation of otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum magnetism.","[Britton, Joseph W.; Sawyer, Brian C.; Bollinger, John J.] US Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Div Time & Frequency, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Keith, Adam C.; Wang, C. -C.

Collective excitations at magnetic QCPs give rise to metallic properties that strongly deviate from the expectations of Landau's Fermi-liquid description(1), which is the standard theory of electron correlations in metals. Central to this theory is the notion of quasiparticles, electronic excitations that possess the quantum numbers of the non-interacting electrons. Here we report measurements of thermal and electrical transport across the field-induced magnetic QCP in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh2Si2 (refs 2, 3). We show that the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivities at the zero-temperature limit obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnetic fields above the critical field at which the QCP is attained. This is also expected for magnetic fields below the critical field, where weak antiferromagnetic order and a Fermi-liquid phase form below 0.07 K (at zero field). At the critical field, however, the low-temperature electrical conductivity exceeds the thermal conductivity by about 10 per cent, suggestive of a non-Fermi-liquid ground state. This apparent violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law provides evidence for an unconventional type of QCP at which the fundamental concept of Landau quasiparticles no longer holds(4-6). These results imply that Landau quasiparticles break up, and that the origin of this disintegration is inelastic scattering associated with electronic quantum critical fluctuations-these insights could be relevant to understanding other deviations from Fermi-liquid behaviour frequently observed in various classes of correlated materials.","[Pfau, Heike; Hartmann, Stefanie; Stockert, Ulrike; Sun, Peijie; Lausberg, Stefan; Brando, Manuel; Friedemann, Sven; Krellner, Cornelius; Geibel, Christoph; Wirth, Steffen; Kirchner, Stefan; Steglich, Frank] Max Planck Inst Chem Phys Solids, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Kirchner, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Abrahams, Elihu] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Si, Qimiao] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Steglich, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem Phys Solids, Nothnitzer Str 40, D-01187 Dresden, Germany.",steglich@cpfs.mpg.de,"Krellner, Cornelius/A-5389-2009; Brando, Manuel/B-4234-2009; Friedemann, Sven/D-4889-2013; Kirchner, Stefan/L-5971-2013; Pfau, Heike/O-7873-2014","Krellner, Cornelius/0000-0002-0671-7729; Friedemann, Sven/0000-0002-0606-4991; Pfau, Heike/0000-0001-6579-4188","DFG Research Unit [960]; NSF [DMR-1006985, 1066293]; Robert A.

Their demise after the rise in atmospheric oxygen by 2.32 billion years (Gyr) ago(1) has been attributed to the removal of dissolved iron through progressive oxidation(2) or sulphidation(3,4) of the deep ocean. Therefore, a sudden return of voluminous iron formations nearly 500 million years later poses an apparent conundrum(3,5). Most late Palaeoproterozoic iron formations are about 1.88 Gyr old(6-8) and occur in the Superior region of North America(5,9,10). Major iron formations are also preserved in Australia, but these were apparently deposited(11) after the transition to a sulphidic ocean at 1.84 Gyr ago that should have terminated iron formation deposition(4), implying that they reflect local marine conditions(5,12). Here we date zircons in tuff layers to show that iron formations in the Frere Formation of Western Australia are about 1.88 Gyr old, indicating that the deposition of iron formations from two disparate cratons was coeval and probably reflects global ocean chemistry. The sudden reappearance of major iron formations at 1.88 Gyr ago-contemporaneous with peaks in global mafic-ultramafic magmatism(13,14), juvenile continental and oceanic crust formation(15,16), mantle depletion(17,18) and volcanogenic massive sulphide formation(5,19)-suggests deposition of iron formations as a consequence of major mantle activity and rapid crustal growth(5,10,15,20). Our findings support the idea that enhanced submarine volcanism and hydrothermal activity linked to a peak in mantle melting released large volumes of ferrous iron and other reductants that overwhelmed the sulphate and oxygen reservoirs of the ocean, decoupling atmospheric and seawater redox states, and causing the return of widespread ferruginous conditions. Iron formations formed on clastic-starved coastal shelves where dissolved iron upwelled and mixed with oxygenated surface water. The disappearance of iron formations after this event may reflect waning mafic-ultramafic magmatism and a diminished flux of hydrothermal iron relative to seawater oxidants.","[Rasmussen, Birger; Fletcher, Ian R.; Gregory, Courtney J.] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Appl Geol, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Bekker, Andrey] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Muhling, Janet R.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Thorne, Alan M.] Geol Survey Western Australia, Dept Mines & Petr, Perth, WA 6004, Australia","Rasmussen, B (reprint author), Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Appl Geol, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",b.rasmussen@curtin.edu.au,"Muhling, Janet/C-4687-2011","Muhling, Janet/0000-0003-1890-9119",ARC; Western Australian government; NSERC,"This work was funded by an ARC Linkage Grant and the Western Australian government Exploration Incentive Scheme Grant to B.

Atmospheric and oceanic forcing have the potential to reduce the thickness and extent of floating ice shelves, potentially limiting their ability to buttress the flow of grounded tributary glaciers(4). Indeed, recent ice-shelf collapse led to retreat and acceleration of several glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula(5). But the extent and magnitude of ice-shelf thickness change, the underlying causes of such change, and its link to glacier flow rate are so poorly understood that its future impact on the ice sheets cannot yet be predicted(3). Here we use satellite laser altimetry and modelling of the surface firn layer to reveal the circum-Antarctic pattern of ice-shelf thinning through increased basal melt. We deduce that this increased melt is the primary control of Antarctic ice-sheet loss, through a reduction in buttressing of the adjacent ice sheet leading to accelerated glacier flow(2). The highest thinning rates occur where warm water at depth can access thick ice shelves via submarine troughs crossing the continental shelf. Wind forcing could explain the dominant patterns of both basal melting and the surface melting and collapse of Antarctic ice shelves, through ocean upwelling in the Amundsen(6) and Bellingshausen(7) seas, and atmospheric warming on the Antarctic Peninsula(8). This implies that climate forcing through changing winds influences Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance, and hence global sea level, on annual to decadal timescales.","[Pritchard, H. D.; Vaughan, D.

This is because long-term coexistence within overlapping ranges is thought to be unlikely in the absence of ecological differentiation(9). Here we challenge this widely held view by generalizing a standard model of sexual selection to include two ubiquitous features of populations with sexual selection: spatial variation in local carrying capacity, and mate-search costs in females. We show that, when these two features are combined, sexual preferences can single-handedly maintain coexistence, even when spatial variation in local carrying capacity is so slight that it might go unnoticed empirically. This theoretical study demonstrates that sexual selection alone can promote the long-term coexistence of ecologically equivalent species with overlapping ranges, and it thus provides a novel explanation for the maintenance of species diversity.","[M'Gonigle, Leithen K.; Otto, Sarah P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Mazzucco, Rupert; Dieckmann, Ulf] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","M'Gonigle, LK (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mgonigle@zoology.ubc.ca,"Otto, Sarah/K-5625-2012","Otto, Sarah/0000-0003-3042-0818; Mazzucco, Rupert/0000-0002-7608-0196",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada); European Science Foundation; WWTF; European Commission; Austrian Science Fund; Austrian Ministry of Science and Research,"We thank J.

The function of most NLR family members has not been characterized and their role in instructing adaptive immune responses remains unclear(2,3). NLRP10 (also known as PYNOD, NALP10, PAN5 and NOD8) is the only NLR lacking the putative ligand-binding leucine-rich-repeat domain, and has been postulated to be a negative regulator of other NLR members, including NLRP3 (refs 4-6). We did not find evidence that NLRP10 functions through an inflammasome to regulate caspase-1 activity nor that it regulates other inflammasomes. Instead, Nlrp10(-/-) mice had a profound defect in helper T-cell-driven immune responses to a diverse array of adjuvants, including lipopolysaccharide, aluminium hydroxide and complete Freund's adjuvant. Adaptive immunity was impaired in the absence of NLRP10 because of a dendritic cell (DC) intrinsic defect in emigration from inflamed tissues, whereas upregulation of DC costimulatory molecules and chemotaxis to CCR7-dependent and -independent ligands remained intact. The loss of antigen transport to the draining lymph nodes by a subset of migratory DCs resulted in an almost absolute loss in naive CD4(+) T-cell priming, highlighting the critical link between diverse innate immune stimulation, NLRP10 activity and the immune function of mature DCs.","[Eisenbarth, Stephanie C.; Gonzalez, David G.; Xu, Lan; Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Williams, Adam; Strowig, Till; Rongvaux, Anthony; Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Thaiss, Christoph A.; Zenewicz, Lauren A.; Elinav, Eran; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Colegio, Oscar R.; Xu, Lan] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Meng, Hailong; Kleinstein, Steven H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Joly, Sophie; Sutterwala, Fayyaz S.] Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Inflammat Program, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kleinstein, Steven H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Interdep Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sutterwala, Fayyaz S.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA","Eisenbarth, SC (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",stephanie.eisenbarth@yale.edu; richard.flavell@yale.edu,,"Eisenbarth, Stephanie/0000-0002-1244-208X; Strowig, Till/0000-0003-0185-1459; Zenewicz, Lauren/0000-0002-8787-5955","Yale CTSA [UL1 RR024139, 5KL2RR024138]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG 108-09]; Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer [1 P50 CA121974]; Dermatology Foundation; Cancer Research Institute; American Physicians for Medicine in Israel Foundation; United States-Israel binational Foundation; Yale Rheumatologic Disease Research Core Center [P30AR053495]; Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation;  [T32HL007974];  [K08AI085038];  [R01AI087630]","We would like to thank R.

However, the requirements for differentiation and the properties of pathogen-induced human T(H)17 cells remain poorly defined. Using an approach that combines the in vitro priming of naive T cells with the ex vivo analysis of memory T cells, we describe here two types of human T(H)17 cells with distinct effector function and differentiation requirements. Candida albicans-specific T(H)17 cells produced IL-17 and IFN-gamma, but no IL-10, whereas Staphylococcus aureus-specific T(H)17 cells produced IL-17 and could produce IL-10 upon restimulation. IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1 beta contributed to T(H)17 differentiation induced by both pathogens, but IL-1 beta was essential in C. albicans-induced T(H)17 differentiation to counteract the inhibitory activity of IL-12 and to prime IL-17/IFN-gamma double-producing cells. In addition, IL-1 beta inhibited IL-10 production in differentiating and in memory T(H)17 cells, whereas blockade of IL-1 beta in vivo led to increased IL-10 production by memory T(H)17 cells. We also show that, after restimulation, T(H)17 cells transiently downregulated IL-17 production through a mechanism that involved IL-2-induced activation of STAT5 and decreased expression of ROR-gamma t. Taken together these findings demonstrate that by eliciting different cytokines C. albicans and S. aureus prime T(H)17 cells that produce either IFN-gamma or IL-10, and identify IL-1 beta and IL-2 as pro-and anti-inflammatory regulators of T(H)17 cells both at priming and in the effector phase.","[Zielinski, Christina E.; Mele, Federico; Aschenbrenner, Dominik; Jarrossay, David; Ronchi, Francesca; Monticelli, Silvia; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Sallusto, Federica] Inst Res Biomed, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Gattorno, Marco] G Gaslini Sci Inst, I-16147 Genoa, Italy; [Lanzavecchia, Antonio] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Sallusto, F (reprint author), Inst Res Biomed, Via Vincenzo Vela 6, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.",christina.zielinski@charite.de; federica.sallusto@irb.usi.ch,,"Monticelli, Silvia/0000-0002-5909-8802","German Research Foundation (DFG) [Zi 1262/1-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [131092, 126027]; Institute of Arthritis Research (IAR); Helmut Horten Foundation","We thank O.

Recent in vitro studies show that the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses(1-7). Both the magnitude and breadth of the IFITM proteins' in vitro effects suggest that they are critical for intrinsic resistance to such viruses, including influenza viruses. Using a knockout mouse model(8), we now test this hypothesis directly and find that IFITM3 is essential for defending the host against influenza A virus in vivo. Mice lacking Ifitm3 display fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 'Spanish' influenza(9,10). Similar increased viral replication is seen in vitro, with protection rescued by the re-introduction of Ifitm3. To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalized subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro.

Here, we performed exudate leukocyte trafficking and mediator-metabololipidomics of murine peritoneal Escherichia coli infections with temporal identification of pro-inflammatory (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). In self-resolving E. coli exudates (10(5) colony forming units, c.f.u.), the dominant SPMs identified were resolvin (Rv) D5 and protectin D1 (PD1), which at 12 h were at significantly greater levels than in exudates from higher titre E. coli (10(7) c.f.u.)-challenged mice. Germfree mice had endogenous RvD1 and PD1 levels higher than in conventional mice. RvD1 and RvD5 (nanograms per mouse) each reduced bacterial titres in blood and exudates, E. coli-induced hypothermia and increased survival, demonstrating the first actions of RvD5. With human polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages, RvD1, RvD5 and PD1 each directly enhanced phagocytosis of E. coli, and RvD5 counter-regulated a panel of pro-inflammatory genes, including NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha. RvD5 activated the RvD1 receptor, GPR32, to enhance phagocytosis. With self-limited E. coli infections, RvD1 and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin accelerated resolution, each shortening resolution intervals (R-i). Host-directed RvD1 actions enhanced ciprofloxacin's therapeutic actions. In 10(7) c.f.u. E. coli infections, SPMs (RvD1, RvD5, PD1) together with ciprofloxacin also heightened host antimicrobial responses. In skin infections, SPMs enhanced vancomycin clearance of Staphylococcus aureus. These results demonstrate that specific SPMs are temporally and differentially regulated during infections and that they are anti-phlogistic, enhance containment and lower antibiotic requirements for bacterial clearance.","[Chiang, Nan; Fredman, Gabrielle; Oh, Sungwhan F.; Vickery, Thad; Schmidt, Birgitta A.; Serhan, Charles N.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Expt Therapeut & Reperfus Injury, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Harvard Inst Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Ctr Cardiovasc & Metab Res, Wallenberg Lab, SE-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden","Serhan, CN (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Expt Therapeut & Reperfus Injury, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Harvard Inst Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cnserhan@zeus.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Backhed, Fredrik/0000-0002-4871-8818","NIH [P01GM095467, R01GM38765]","The authors thank M.

Considerable effort has been invested in using IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for a variety of immune disorders ranging from AIDS to cancer. However, adverse effects have limited its use in the clinic. On activated T cells, IL-2 signals through a quaternary 'high affinity' receptor complex consisting of IL-2, IL-2R alpha (termed CD25), IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma(4-8). Naive T cells express only a low density of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma, and are therefore relatively insensitive to IL-2, but acquire sensitivity after CD25 expression, which captures the cytokine and presents it to IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma. Here, using in vitro evolution, we eliminated the functional requirement of IL-2 for CD25 expression by engineering an IL-2 'superkine' (also called super-2) with increased binding affinity for IL-2R beta. Crystal structures of the IL-2 superkine in free and receptor-bound forms showed that the evolved mutations are principally in the core of the cytokine, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the evolved mutations stabilized IL-2, reducing the flexibility of a helix in the IL-2R beta binding site, into an optimized receptor-binding conformation resembling that when bound to CD25. The evolved mutations in the IL-2 superkine recapitulated the functional role of CD25 by eliciting potent phosphorylation of STAT5 and vigorous proliferation of T cells irrespective of CD25 expression. Compared to IL-2, the IL-2 superkine induced superior expansion of cytotoxic T cells, leading to improved antitumour responses in vivo, and elicited proportionally less expansion of T regulatory cells and reduced pulmonary oedema. Collectively, we show that in vitro evolution has mimicked the functional role of CD25 in enhancing IL-2 potency and regulating target cell specificity, which has implications for immunotherapy.","[Levin, Aron M.; Garcia, K.

The histone H3 variant CENP-A (also known as CenH3) defines centromeres in monocentric organisms, which confine centromere activity to a discrete chromosomal region, and holocentric organisms, which distribute centromere activity along the chromosome length(1-3). Because the highly repetitive DNA found at most centromeres is neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere function, stable inheritance of CENP-A nucleosomal chromatin is postulated to propagate centromere identity epigenetically(4). Here, we show that in the holocentric nematode Caenorhabditis elegans pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes are not necessary to guide recruitment of new CENP-A nucleosomes. This is indicated by lack of CENP-A transmission by sperm during fertilization and by removal and subsequent reloading of CENP-A during oogenic meiotic prophase. Genome-wide mapping of CENP-A location in embryos and quantification of CENP-A molecules in nuclei revealed that CENP-A is incorporated at low density in domains that cumulatively encompass half the genome. Embryonic CENP-A domains are established in a pattern inverse to regions that are transcribed in the germline and early embryo, and ectopic transcription of genes in a mutant germline altered the pattern of CENP-A incorporation in embryos. Furthermore, regions transcribed in the germline but not embryos fail to incorporate CENP-A throughout embryogenesis. We propose that germline transcription defines genomic regions that exclude CENP-A incorporation in progeny, and that zygotic transcription during early embryogenesis remodels and reinforces this basal pattern. These findings link centromere identity to transcription and shed light on the evolutionary plasticity of centromeres.","[Gassmann, Reto; Yuen, Karen W.; Muroyama, Andrew; Barron, Francie; Maddox, Paul; Essex, Anthony; Monen, Joost; Oegema, Karen; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gassmann, Reto; Yuen, Karen W.; Muroyama, Andrew; Barron, Francie; Maddox, Paul; Essex, Anthony; Monen, Joost; Oegema, Karen; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rechtsteiner, Andreas; Egelhofer, Thea; Gaydos, Laura; Strome, Susan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ercan, Sevinc; Lieb, Jason D.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Carolina Ctr Genome Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Ercan, Sevinc; Lieb, Jason D.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Desai, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",sstrome@ucsc.edu; abdesai@ucsd.edu,"Gassmann, Reto/M-6488-2013","Gassmann, Reto/0000-0002-0360-2977; Barron, Francie/0000-0001-6568-7358","modENCODE [U01 HG004270]; NIH [GM074215, GM34059, T32 GM008646]; National Science Foundation of Switzerland; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research","We thank S.

Transient pausing of ribosomes can affect a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding(1). These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the messenger RNA(2). Thus, redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria by ribosome profiling-deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments(3-5). This approach enables the high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly, we found that codons decoded by rare transfer RNAs do not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine-Dalgarno-(SD) 6-like features within coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome(7,8) possessing an altered anti-SD sequence, we show that pausing is due to hybridization between the mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA of the translating ribosome. In protein-coding sequences, internal SD sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage, avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical SD sites. Our results indicate that internal SD-like sequences are a major determinant of translation rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes.","[Li, Gene-Wei; Oh, Eugene; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Weissman, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",weissman@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank E.

However, the mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that ensure proper feedback control of tissue growth(1-4), which when deregulated contribute to tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here we use the fly notum as a model system(5) to identify a novel process of crowding-induced cell delamination that balances growth to ensure the development of well-ordered cell packing. In crowded regions of the tissue, a proportion of cells undergo a serial loss of cell-cell junctions and a progressive loss of apical area, before being squeezed out by their neighbours. This path of delamination is recapitulated by a simple computational model of epithelial mechanics, in which stochastic cell loss relieves overcrowding as the system tends towards equilibrium. We show that this process of delamination is mechanistically distinct from apoptosis-mediated cell extrusion(6-8) and precedes the first signs of cell death. Overall, this analysis reveals a simple mechanism that buffers epithelia against variations in growth. Because live-cell delamination constitutes a mechanistic link between epithelial hyperplasia and cell invasion, this is likely to have important implications for our understanding of the early stages of cancer development.","[Marinari, Eliana; Curran, Scott; Baum, Buzz] UCL, MRC, Mol Cell Biol Lab, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mehonic, Aida; Duke, Thomas] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mehonic, Aida; Duke, Thomas] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gale, Jonathan] UCL, UCL Ear Inst, London WC1X 8EE, England","Baum, B (reprint author), UCL, MRC, Mol Cell Biol Lab, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",b.baum@ucl.ac.uk,,"Baum, Buzz/0000-0002-9201-6186","Cancer Research UK; University College London, Wellcome and the Royal Society","We thank J.

Although compensatory cell division can be triggered by dying cells(1-3), it is unknown how cell death might relieve overcrowding due to proliferation. When we trigger apoptosis in epithelia, dying cells are extruded to preserve a functional barrier(4). Extrusion occurs by cells destined to die signalling to surrounding epithelial cells to contract an actomyosin ring that squeezes the dying cell out(4-6). However, it is not clear what drives cell death during normal homeostasis. Here we show in human, canine and zebrafish cells that overcrowding due to proliferation and migration induces extrusion of live cells to control epithelial cell numbers. Extrusion of live cells occurs at sites where the highest crowding occurs in vivo and can be induced by experimentally overcrowding monolayers in vitro. Like apoptotic cell extrusion, live cell extrusion resulting from overcrowding also requires sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling and Rho-kinase-dependent myosin contraction, but is distinguished by signalling through stretch-activated channels. Moreover, disruption of a stretch-activated channel, Piezo1, in zebrafish prevents extrusion and leads to the formation of epithelial cell masses. Our findings reveal that during homeostatic turnover, growth and division of epithelial cells on a confined substratum cause overcrowding that leads to their extrusion and consequent death owing to the loss of survival factors. These results suggest that live cell extrusion could be a tumour-suppressive mechanism that prevents the accumulation of excess epithelial cells.","[Eisenhoffer, George T.; Loftus, Patrick D.; Rosenblatt, Jody] Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Dept Oncol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Yoshigi, Masaaki] Univ Utah, Dept Pediat, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA; [Otsuna, Hideo; Chien, Chi-Bin] Univ Utah, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Morcos, Paul A.] Gene Tools LLC, Philomath, OR 97370 USA","Rosenblatt, J (reprint author), Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Dept Oncol Sci, 2000 Circle Hope Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",jody.rosenblatt@hci.utah.edu,,,"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [EB-4443]; NIH-NIGMS NIH [1 DP2OD002056-01]; Laura and Arthur Colwin Endowed Marine Biology Laboratories Summer Research Fellowship Fund; NIH [5T32 CA03247-8, MH092256]; American Cancer Society [120464-PF-11-095-01 CSM]; University of Utah;  [P30 CA042014]","We thank B.

Impaired insulin action in peripheral tissues is a major pathogenic factor. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue through the GLUT4 (also known as SLC2A4) glucose transporter, and alterations in adipose tissue GLUT4 expression or function regulate systemic insulin sensitivity. Downregulation of human and mouse adipose tissue GLUT4 occurs early in diabetes development. Here we report that adipose tissue GLUT4 regulates the expression of carbohydrate-responsive-element-binding protein (ChREBP; also known as MLXIPL), a transcriptional regulator of lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose ChREBP is a major determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin sensitivity. We find a new mechanism for glucose regulation of ChREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical ChREBP isoform (ChREBP-alpha) induces expression of a novel, potent isoform (ChREBP-beta) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter. ChREBP-beta expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin sensitivity, indicating that it may be an effective target for treating diabetes.","[Herman, Mark A.; Peroni, Odile D.; Villoria, Jorge; Kahn, Barbara B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Herman, Mark A.; Peroni, Odile D.; Villoria, Jorge; Kahn, Barbara B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Schoen, Michael R.] Stadt Klinikum Karlsruhe, Clin Visceral Surg, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Abumrad, Nada A.; Klein, Samuel] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Human Nutr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Blueher, Matthias] Univ Leipzig, Dept Med, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Kahn, BB (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",bkahn@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Herman, Mark/H-3232-2012","Schon, Michael/0000-0002-0698-4130","NIH [R37 DK43051, K08 DK076726]; BADERC [DK057521]; BNORC [DK046200]; Picower and JPB Foundations; Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study; Nutrition and Obesity Research Unit [DK056341, DK037948]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschft DFG [KFO152, BL833/1]","We thank H.

It is broadly accepted that the paternal genome is actively depleted of 5-methylcytosine at fertilization, followed by passive loss that reaches a minimum at the blastocyst stage. However, this model is based on limited data, and so far no base-resolution maps exist to support and refine it. Here we generate genome-scale DNA methylation maps in mouse gametes and from the zygote through post-implantation. We find that the oocyte already exhibits global hypomethylation, particularly at specific families of long interspersed element 1 and long terminal repeat retroelements, which are disparately methylated between gametes and have lower methylation values in the zygote than in sperm. Surprisingly, the oocyte contributes a unique set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)-including many CpG island promoters-that are maintained in the early embryo but are lost upon specification and absent from somatic cells. In contrast, sperm-contributed DMRs are largely intergenic and become hypermethylated after the blastocyst stage. Our data provide a genome-scale, base-resolution timeline of DNA methylation in the pre-specified embryo, when this epigenetic modification is most dynamic, before returning to the canonical somatic pattern.","[Smith, Zachary D.; Chan, Michelle M.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Gu, Hongcang; Gnirke, Andreas; Regev, Aviv; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chan, Michelle M.] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Dept Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Meissner, A (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,"Mikkelsen, Tarjei/A-1306-2007","Mikkelsen, Tarjei/0000-0002-8133-3135","NIH [5DP1OD003958, 5RC1AA019317, U01ES017155, P01GM099117]; HHMI; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Massachusetts Life Science Center; Pew Charitable Trusts; Center for Excellence in Genome Science from the NHGRI [1P50HG006193-01]; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface","We would like to thank all members of the Meissner and Regev laboratories.

Features that can be clearly visualized at this resolution include the coordination of ADP in each of four distinct nucleotide-binding sites in the ring-shaped AAA(+) ATPase unit, a newly identified interaction interface between the ring and mechanical linker, and junctional structures between the ring and microtubule-binding stalk, all of which should be critical for the mechanism of dynein motility.

GRBs (c-ray bursts) have been proposed as possible candidate sources(1-3). In the GRB 'fireball' model, cosmic-ray acceleration should be accompanied by neutrinos produced in the decay of charged pions created in interactions between the high-energy cosmic-ray protons and gamma-rays(4). Previous searches for such neutrinos found none, but the constraints were weak because the sensitivity was at best approximately equal to the predicted flux(5-7). Here we report an upper limit on the flux of energetic neutrinos associated with GRBs that is at least a factor of 3.7 below the predictions(4,8-10). This implies either that GRBs are not the only sources of cosmic rays with energies exceeding 10(18) electronvolts or that the efficiency of neutrino production is much lower than has been predicted.","[Abbasi, R.; Ahlers, M.; Andeen, K.; Auffenberg, J.; Baker, M.; BenZvi, S.; Brown, A.

CQPS is a phenomenon exactly dual(1) to the Josephson effect; whereas the latter is a coherent transfer of charges between superconducting leads(2,3), the former is a coherent transfer of vortices or fluxes across a superconducting wire. In contrast to previously reported observations(4-8) of incoherent phase slip, CQPS has been only a subject of theoretical study(9-12). Its experimental demonstration is made difficult by quasiparticle dissipation due to gapless excitations in nanowires or in vortex cores. This difficulty might be overcome by using certain strongly disordered superconductors near the superconductor-insulator transition. Here we report direct observation of CQPS in a narrow segment of a superconducting loop made of strongly disordered indium oxide; the effect is made manifest through the superposition of quantum states with different numbers of flux quanta(13). As with the Josephson effect, our observation should lead to new applications in superconducting electronics and quantum metrology(1,10,11).","[Astafiev, O. V.; Kafanov, S.; Pashkin, Yu. A.; Tsai, J.

Explanations for this phenomenon have invoked a denser atmosphere that provided warmth by nitrogen pressure broadening(1) or enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations(2). Such solutions are allowed by geochemical studies and numerical investigations that place approximate concentration limits on Archaean atmospheric gases, including methane, carbon dioxide and oxygen(2-7). But no field data constraining ground-level air density and barometric pressure have been reported, leaving the plausibility of these various hypotheses in doubt. Here we show that raindrop imprints in tuffs of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, South Africa, constrain surface air density 2.7 billion years ago to less than twice modern levels. We interpret the raindrop fossils using experiments in which water droplets of known size fall at terminal velocity into fresh and weathered volcanic ash, thus defining a relationship between imprint size and raindrop impact momentum. Fragmentation following raindrop flattening limits raindrop size to a maximum value independent of air density, whereas raindrop terminal velocity varies as the inverse of the square root of air density. If the Archaean raindrops reached the modern maximum measured size, air density must have been less than 2.3 kg m(-3), compared to today's 1.2 kg m(-3), but because such drops rarely occur, air density was more probably below 1.3 kg m(-3). The upper estimate for air density renders the pressure broadening explanation(1) possible, but it is improbable under the likely lower estimates. Our results also disallow the extreme CO2 levels required for hot Archaean climates(8).","[Som, Sanjoy M.; Catling, David C.; Harnmeijer, Jelte P.; Polivka, Peter M.; Buick, Roger] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Som, Sanjoy M.; Catling, David C.; Harnmeijer, Jelte P.; Polivka, Peter M.; Buick, Roger] Univ Washington, Astrobiol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Som, Sanjoy M.] Blue Marble Space Inst Sci, Seattle, WA 98145 USA; [Harnmeijer, Jelte P.] Edinburgh Ctr Low Carbon Innovat, Sustainable Community Energy Network, Edinburgh EH8 9AA, Midlothian, Scotland; [Polivka, Peter M.] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Som, SM (reprint author), NASA, Exobiol Branch, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",sanjoy.m.som@nasa.gov,,"Buick, Roger/0000-0003-0139-1659; Catling, David/0000-0001-5646-120X","NASA [NNX08AP56G, NNX10AQ90G]; Coordination Action for Research Activities on life in Extreme Environments (CAREX); European Commission; University of Washington Department of Earth and Space Sciences, and its Geoclub","This work was supported by NASA Exobiology/Astrobiology grant NNX08AP56G.

Considerable progress has been made in documenting and more precisely correlating biotic patterns in the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian fossil record with geochemical and physical environmental perturbations(2-5), but the mechanisms responsible for those perturbations remain uncertain(1,2). Here we use new stratigraphic and geochemical data to show that early Palaeozoic marine sediments deposited approximately 540-480 Myr ago record both an expansion in the area of shallow epicontinental seas and anomalous patterns of chemical sedimentation that are indicative of increased oceanic alkalinity and enhanced chemical weathering of continental crust. These geochemical conditions were caused by a protracted period of widespread continental denudation during the Neoproterozoic followed by extensive physical reworking of soil, regolith and basement rock during the first continental-scale marine transgression of the Phanerozoic. The resultant globally occurring stratigraphic surface, which in most regions separates continental crystalline basement rock from much younger Cambrian shallow marine sedimentary deposits, is known as the Great Unconformity(6). Although Darwin and others have interpreted this widespread hiatus in sedimentation on the continents as a failure of the geologic record, this palaeogeomorphic surface represents a unique physical environmental boundary condition that affected seawater chemistry during a time of profound expansion of shallow marine habitats. Thus, the formation of the Great Unconformity may have been an environmental trigger for the evolution of biomineralization and the 'Cambrian explosion' of ecologic and taxonomic diversity following the Neoproterozoic emergence of animals.","[Peters, Shanan E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gaines, Robert R.] Pomona Coll, Dept Geol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Peters, SE (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",peters@geology.wisc.edu,"Peters, Shanan/A-5620-2013","Peters, Shanan/0000-0002-3346-4317","NSF [EAR-0819931, EAR-1046233, DUE-0942447]","We thank D.

One hypothesis is that magnetic information is transduced into neuronal impulses by using a magnetite-based magnetoreceptor(3,4). Previous studies claim to have identified a magnetic sense system in the pigeon, common to avian species, which consists of magnetite-containing trigeminal afferents located at six specific loci in the rostral subepidermis of the beak(5-8). These studies have been widely accepted in the field and heavily relied upon by both behavioural biologists and physicists(9-11). Here we show that clusters of iron-rich cells in the rostro-medial upper beak of the pigeon Columbia livia are macrophages, not magnetosensitive neurons. Our systematic characterization of the pigeon upper beak identified iron-rich cells in the stratum laxum of the subepidermis, the basal region of the respiratory epithelium and the apex of feather follicles. Using a three-dimensional blueprint of the pigeon beak created by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, we mapped the location of iron-rich cells, revealing unexpected variation in their distribution and number-an observation that is inconsistent with a role in magnetic sensation. Ultrastructure analysis of these cells, which are not unique to the beak, showed that their subcellular architecture includes ferritin-like granules, siderosomes, haemosiderin and filopodia, characteristics of iron-rich macrophages. Our conclusion that these cells are macrophages and not magnetosensitive neurons is supported by immunohistological studies showing co-localization with the antigen-presenting molecule major histocompatibility complex class II. Our work necessitates a renewed search for the true magnetite-dependent magnetoreceptor in birds.","[Treiber, Christoph Daniel; Salzer, Marion Claudia; Edelman, Nathaniel; Sugar, Cristina; Breuss, Martin; Pichler, Paul; Keays, David Anthony] Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Riegler, Johannes; Lythgoe, Mark] UCL, Ctr Adv Biomed Imaging, Dept Med, London WC1E 6DD, England; [Riegler, Johannes; Lythgoe, Mark] UCL, Inst Child Hlth, London WC1E 6DD, England; [Cadiou, Herve] Univ Strasbourg, INCI, CNRS, UPR 3212, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Breuss, Martin; Shaw, Jeremy] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Crawley 6009, Australia","Keays, DA (reprint author), Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",keays@imp.ac.at,"Shaw, Jeremy/B-4156-2011; Saunders, Martin/B-3082-2011","Shaw, Jeremy/0000-0002-5140-457X; Saunders, Martin/0000-0001-6873-7816; Breuss, Martin Werner/0000-0003-2200-8604",Boehringer Ingelheim,"We would like to thank M.

Drosophila melanogaster's rhythmic locomotor behaviour provides the main phenotype for the identification of higher eukaryotic clock genes(2,3). Under laboratory light-dark cycles, flies show enhanced activity before lights on and off signals(4,5), and these anticipatory responses have defined the neuronal sites of the corresponding morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators(6,7). However, the natural environment provides much richer cycling environmental stimuli than the laboratory, so we sought to examine fly locomotor rhythms in the wild. Here we show that several key laboratory-based assumptions about circadian behaviour are not supported by natural observations. These include the anticipation of light transitions, the midday 'siesta', the fly's crepuscular activity, its nocturnal behaviour under moonlight, and the dominance of light stimuli over temperature. We also observe a third major locomotor component in addition to M and E, which we term 'A' (afternoon). Furthermore, we show that these natural rhythm phenotypes can be observed in the laboratory by using realistic temperature and light cycle simulations. Our results suggest that a comprehensive re-examination of circadian behaviour and its molecular readouts under simulated natural conditions will provide a more authentic interpretation of the adaptive significance of this important rhythmic phenotype. Such studies should also help to clarify the underlying molecular and neuroanatomical substrates of the clock under natural protocols.","[Vanin, Stefano; Montelli, Stefano; Menegazzi, Pamela; Pegoraro, Mirko; Sandrelli, Federica; Costa, Rodolfo] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Bhutani, Supriya; Green, Edward W.; Pegoraro, Mirko; Kyriacou, Charalambos P.] Univ Leicester, Dept Genet, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Costa, R (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",rodolfo.costa@unipd.it,"Menegazzi, Pamela/M-7022-2017","Menegazzi, Pamela/0000-0001-5232-1920; Bhutani, Supriya/0000-0002-0855-2139; Vanin, Stefano/0000-0003-1676-5916; SANDRELLI, FEDERICA/0000-0002-5631-7467",European Community [018741]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; National Environmental Research Council; Royal Society; Medical Research Council; Italian Space Agency (DCMC); Ministero dell'Universita e delle Ricerca (MIUR),"We thank S.

Astrocytes, which make up the largest glial population, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity during postnatal development(2). Because defects in astrocyte generation are associated with severe neurological disorders such as brain tumours(3), it is important to understand how astrocytes are produced. Astrocytes reportedly arise from two sources(4-6): radial glia in the ventricular zone and progenitors in the subventricular zone, with the contribution from each region shifting with time. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, the glial cell population, which contains predominantly astrocytes, expands 6-8-fold in the rodent brain(7). Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this expansion. Here we show that a major source of glia in the postnatal cortex in mice is the local proliferation of differentiated astrocytes. Unlike glial progenitors in the subventricular zone, differentiated astrocytes undergo symmetric division, and their progeny integrate functionally into the existing glial network as mature astrocytes that form endfeet with blood vessels, couple electrically to neighbouring astrocytes, and take up glutamate after neuronal activity.","[Ge, Woo-Ping; Jan, Yuh Nung; Jan, Lily Yeh] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ge, Woo-Ping; Jan, Yuh Nung; Jan, Lily Yeh] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ge, Woo-Ping; Jan, Yuh Nung; Jan, Lily Yeh] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Gage, Fred H.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Jan, LY (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol, 1550 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",lily.jan@ucsf.edu,"Miyawaki, Atsushi/K-3569-2014","Miyawaki, Atsushi/0000-0002-2329-3235; Jan, Yuh Nung/0000-0003-1367-6299; Jan, Lily/0000-0003-3938-8498","Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) [1K99NS073735]; National Institute of Mental Health [4R37MH065334]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5R01MH084234]; NIH/National Institute on Aging [P01 AG010435, MH090258]; Jeffry M. and Barbara Picower Foundation(JBP); McDonnell Foundation","We thank K.

These neurons can be tagged during learning for subsequent identification(3) and manipulation(4-6). Moreover, their ablation or inactivation results in reduced memory expression, suggesting their necessity in mnemonic processes. However, the question of sufficiency remains: it is unclear whether it is possible to elicit the behavioural output of a specific memory by directly activating a population of neurons that was active during learning. Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)(7,8) and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear-conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context-specific. Together, our findings indicate that activating a sparse but specific ensemble of hippocampal neurons that contribute to a memory engram is sufficient for the recall of that memory. Moreover, our experimental approach offers a general method of mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams.","[Liu, Xu; Ramirez, Steve; Pang, Petti T.; Puryear, Corey B.; Govindarajan, Arvind; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, RIKEN MIT Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Liu, Xu; Ramirez, Steve; Pang, Petti T.; Puryear, Corey B.; Govindarajan, Arvind; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, RIKEN MIT Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Tonegawa, S (reprint author), MIT, RIKEN MIT Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tonegawa@mit.edu,,,"Tonegawa laboratory; National Institutes of Health [R01-MH078821, P50-MH58880]; RIKEN Brain Science Institute","We thank S.

Splicing is physically and functionally coupled to transcription, and is greatly affected by the rate of transcript elongation(1-3). As the nascent pre-mRNA emerges from transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), it is assembled into a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle; this is the functional form of the nascent pre-mRNA and determines the fate of the mature transcript(4). However, factors that connect the transcribing polymerase with the mRNP particle and help to integrate transcript elongation with mRNA splicing remain unclear. Here we characterize the human interactome of chromatin-associated mRNP particles. This led us to identify deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) and ZNF326 (which we call ZNF-protein interacting with nuclear mRNPs and DBC1 (ZIRD)) as subunits of a novel protein complex-named DBIRD-that binds directly to RNAPII. DBIRD regulates alternative splicing of a large set of exons embedded in (A + T)-rich DNA, and is present at the affected exons. RNA-interference-mediated DBIRD depletion results in region-specific decreases in transcript elongation, particularly across areas encompassing affected exons. Together, these data indicate that the DBIRD complex acts at the interface between mRNP particles and RNAPII, integrating transcript elongation with the regulation of alternative splicing.","[Close, Pierre; Dirac-Svejstrup, A.

The prevailing model underlying epithelial folding involves cell shape changes driven by myosin-dependent apical constriction(1). Here we describe an alternative mechanism that requires differential positioning of adherens junctions controlled by modulation of epithelial apical-basal polarity. Using live embryo imaging, we show that before the initiation of dorsal transverse folds during Drosophila gastrulation, adherens junctions shift basally in the initiating cells, but maintain their original subapical positioning in the neighbouring cells. Junctional positioning in the dorsal epithelium depends on the polarity proteins Bazooka and Par-1. In particular, the basal shift that occurs in the initiating cells is associated with a progressive decrease in Par-1 levels. We show that uniform reduction of the activity of Bazooka or Par-1 results in uniform apical or lateral positioning of junctions and in each case dorsal fold initiation is abolished. In addition, an increase in the Bazooka/Par-1 ratio causes formation of ectopic dorsal folds. The basal shift of junctions not only alters the apical shape of the initiating cells, but also forces the lateral membrane of the adjacent cells to bend towards the initiating cells, thereby facilitating tissue deformation. Our data thus establish a direct link between modification of epithelial polarity and initiation of epithelial folding.","[Wang, Yu-Chiun; Wieschaus, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Wang, Yu-Chiun; Wieschaus, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Khan, Zia] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Khan, Zia; Kaschube, Matthias] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Wieschaus, EF (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",efw@princeton.edu,,,Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM071508]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [5R37HD15587],"We thank A.

Dystrophin-deficient muscle fibres are fragile and susceptible to an influx of Ca2+, which activates inflammatory and muscle degenerative pathways(4-6). At present there is no cure for DMD, and existing therapies are ineffective. Here we show that increasing the expression of intramuscular heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) preserves muscle strength and ameliorates the dystrophic pathology in two mouse models of muscular dystrophy. Treatment with BGP-15 (a pharmacological inducer of Hsp72 currently in clinical trials for diabetes) improved muscle architecture, strength and contractile function in severely affected diaphragm muscles in mdx dystrophic mice. In dko mice, a phenocopy of DMD that results in severe spinal curvature (kyphosis), muscle weakness and premature death(7,8), BGP-15 decreased kyphosis, improved the dystrophic pathophysiology in limb and diaphragm muscles and extended lifespan. We found that the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA, the main protein responsible for the removal of intracellular Ca2+) is dysfunctional in severely affected muscles of mdx and dko mice, and that Hsp72 interacts with SERCA to preserve its function under conditions of stress, ultimately contributing to the decreased muscle degeneration seen with Hsp72 upregulation. Treatment with BGP-15 similarly increased SERCA activity in dystrophic skeletal muscles. Our results provide evidence that increasing the expression of Hsp72 in muscle (through the administration of BGP-15) has significant therapeutic potential for DMD and related conditions, either as a self-contained therapy or as an adjuvant with other potential treatments, including gene, cell and pharmacological therapies.","[Gehrig, Stefan M.; van der Poel, Chris; Sayer, Timothy A.; Schertzer, Jonathan D.; Church, Jarrod E.; Lynch, Gordon S.] Univ Melbourne, Basic & Clin Myol Lab, Dept Physiol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Henstridge, Darren C.; Febbraio, Mark A.] Baker IDI Heart & Diabet Inst, Cellular & Mol Metab Lab, Melbourne, Vic 8008, Australia; [Lamon, Severine; Russell, Aaron P.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Phys Act & Nutr Res, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Davies, Kay E.] Univ Oxford, MRC Funct Genom Unit, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England","Lynch, GS (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Basic & Clin Myol Lab, Dept Physiol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",gsl@unimelb.edu.au,"Lynch, Gordon/G-9553-2015","Lynch, Gordon/0000-0001-9220-9810; Church, Jarrod/0000-0001-8266-4043; Lamon, Severine/0000-0002-3271-6551","National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [1009114, 472650, 1004441]; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies (France); Muscular Dystrophy Association (USA); Swiss National Science Foundation; National Heart Foundation (Australia); National Heart Foundation; Fondazione Telethon","We thank R.

H+-PPases are found primarily as homodimers in the vacuolar membrane of plants and the plasma membrane of several protozoa and prokaryotes(2,3). The three-dimensional structure and detailed mechanisms underlying the enzymatic and proton translocation reactions of H+-PPases are unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of a Vigna radiata H+-PPase (VrH(+)-PPase) in complex with a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue, imidodiphosphate (IDP), at 2.35 angstrom resolution. Each VrH(+)-PPase subunit consists of an integral membrane domain formed by 16 transmembrane helices. IDP is bound in the cytosolic region of each subunit and trapped by numerous charged residues and five Mg2+ ions. A previously undescribed proton translocation pathway is formed by six core transmembrane helices. Proton pumping can be initialized by PPi hydrolysis, and H+ is then transported into the vacuolar lumen through a pathway consisting of Arg 242, Asp 294, Lys 742 and Glu 301. We propose a working model of the mechanism for the coupling between proton pumping and PPi hydrolysis by H+-PPases.","[Lin, Shih-Ming; Huang, Yun-Tzu; Chiu, Chen-Liang; Liu, Mu-Hsuan; Tung, Jung-Yu; Liu, Tseng-Huang; Pan, Rong-Long; Sun, Yuh-Ju] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Life Sci, Coll Life Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Lin, Shih-Ming; Huang, Yun-Tzu; Chiu, Chen-Liang; Liu, Mu-Hsuan; Tung, Jung-Yu; Liu, Tseng-Huang; Pan, Rong-Long; Sun, Yuh-Ju] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Bioinformat & Struct Biol, Coll Life Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Tsai, Jia-Yin; Hsiao, Chwan-Deng] Acad Sinica, Inst Mol Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan","Sun, YJ (reprint author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Life Sci, Coll Life Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",rlpan@life.nthu.edu.tw; yjsun@life.nthu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 99-2311-B-007-007-MY3, NSC 100-2311-B-007-001-MY3, NSC 100-2627-M-007-012]; National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan [99N82416E1]","We thank M.

We show that atom-cavity systems form universal nodes capable of sending, receiving, storing and releasing photonic quantum information. Quantum connectivity between nodes is achieved in the conceptually most fundamental way-by the coherent exchange of a single photon. We demonstrate the faithful transfer of an atomic quantum state and the creation of entanglement between two identical nodes in separate laboratories. The non-local state that is created is manipulated by local quantum bit (qubit) rotation. This efficient cavity-based approach to quantum networking is particularly promising because it offers a clear perspective for scalability, thus paving the way towards large-scale quantum networks and their applications.","[Ritter, Stephan; Noelleke, Christian; Hahn, Carolin; Reiserer, Andreas; Neuzner, Andreas; Uphoff, Manuel; Muecke, Martin; Figueroa, Eden; Bochmann, Joerg; Rempe, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Ritter, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",stephan.ritter@mpq.mpg.de,"Ritter, Stephan/F-1579-2010; Reiserer, Andreas/J-3243-2014; Reiserer, Andreas/G-4980-2017","Ritter, Stephan/0000-0001-9002-7407; Reiserer, Andreas/0000-0001-9595-7363; Reiserer, Andreas/0000-0001-9595-7363",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Research Unit 635); European Union; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung via IKT (QK_QuOReP); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,"We thank D.

Compared to axon guidance, far less is understood about how individual pre- and postsynaptic partners are matched. To ensure the proper relay of olfactory information in the fruitfly Drosophila, axons of similar to 50 classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) form one-to-one connections with dendrites of similar to 50 classes of projection neurons (PNs). Here, using genetic screens, we identified two evolutionarily conserved, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-repeat containing transmembrane Teneurin proteins, Ten-m and Ten-a, as synaptic-partner-matching molecules between PN dendrites and ORN axons. Ten-m and Ten-a are highly expressed in select PN-ORN matching pairs. Teneurin loss- and gain-of-function cause specific mismatching of select ORNs and PNs. Finally, Teneurins promote homophilic interactions in vitro, and Ten-m co-expression in non-partner PNs and ORNs promotes their ectopic connections in vivo. We propose that Teneurins instruct matching specificity between synaptic partners through homophilic attraction.","[Hong, Weizhe; Mosca, Timothy J.; Luo, Liqun] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Luo, LQ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lluo@stanford.edu,"Hong, Weizhe/E-3164-2010","Hong, Weizhe/0000-0003-1523-8575; Mosca, Timothy/0000-0003-3485-0719","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 DC-005982, 5T32 NS007280, HD007249]","We thank V.

The SAC is imposed by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), whose assembly is catalysed by unattached chromosomes and which binds and inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), the E3 ubiquitin ligase that initiates chromosome segregation. Here, using the crystal structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe MCC(a complex of mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint proteins Mad2, Mad3 and APC/C co-activator protein Cdc20), we reveal the molecular basis of MCC-mediated APC/C inhibition and the regulation of MCC assembly. The MCC inhibits the APC/C by obstructing degron recognition sites on Cdc20 (the substrate recruitment subunit of the APC/C) and displacing Cdc20 to disrupt formation of a bipartite D-box receptor with the APC/C subunit Apc10. Mad2, in the closed conformation (C-Mad2), stabilizes the complex by optimally positioning the Mad3 KEN-box degron to bind Cdc20. Mad3 and p31(comet) (also known as MAD2L1-binding protein) compete for the same C-Mad2 interface, which explains how p31(comet) disrupts MCC assembly to antagonize the SAC. This study shows how APC/C inhibition is coupled to degron recognition by co-activators.","[Chao, William C.

Upon ultraviolet-B irradiation, UVR8 undergoes an immediate switch from homodimer to monomer, which triggers a signalling pathway for ultraviolet protection. The mechanism by which UVR8 senses ultraviolet-B remains largely unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of UVR8 at 1.8 angstrom resolution, revealing a symmetric homodimer of seven-bladed beta-propeller that is devoid of any external cofactor as the chromophore. Arginine residues that stabilize the homodimeric interface, principally Arg 286 and Arg 338, make elaborate intramolecular cation-pi interactions with surrounding tryptophan amino acids. Two of these tryptophans, Trp 285 and Trp 233, collectively serve as the ultraviolet-B chromophore. Our structural and biochemical analyses identify the molecular mechanism for UVR8-mediated ultraviolet-B perception, in which ultraviolet-B radiation results in destabilization of the intramolecular cation-pi interactions, causing disruption of the critical intermolecular hydrogen bonds mediated by Arg 286 and Arg 338 and subsequent dissociation of the UVR8 homodimer.","[Wu, Di; Hu, Qi; Yan, Zhen; Zhang, Jing; Deng, Haiteng; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wu, Di; Hu, Qi; Yan, Zhen; Yan, Chuangye; Zhang, Jing; Deng, Haiteng; Wang, Jiawei; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wen; Huang, Xi; Yang, Panyu; Deng, XingWang] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yan, Chuangye; Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Struct Biol Ctr, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xi; Yang, Panyu; Deng, XingWang] Peking Univ, Peking Yale Joint Ctr Plant Mol Genet & Agrobiote, State Key Lab Prot & Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Shi, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shi-lab@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918801, 2012CB910900]; National Natural Science Foundation; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Beijing Municipal Commission of Science; Beijing Municipal Commission of Technology","We thank J.

Stellar pulsations are thought to elevate gas to an altitude cool enough for the condensation of dust(1), which is then accelerated by radiation pressure, entraining the gas and driving the wind(2,4,5). Explaining the amount of mass loss, however, has been a problem because of the difficulty of observing tenuous gas and dust only tens of milliarcseconds from the star. For this reason, there is no consensus on the way sufficient momentum is transferred from the light from the star to the outflow. Here we report spatially resolved, multiwavelength observations of circumstellar dust shells of three stars on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. When imaged in scattered light, dust shells were found at remarkably small radii (less than about two stellar radii) and with unexpectedly large grains (about 300 nanometres in radius). This proximity to the photosphere argues for dust species that are transparent to the light from the star and, therefore, resistant to sublimation by the intense radiation field. Although transparency usually implies insufficient radiative pressure to drive a wind(6,7), the radiation field can accelerate these large grains through photon scattering rather than absorption(8)-a plausible mass loss mechanism for lower-amplitude pulsating stars.","[Norris, Barnaby R.

One important practical goal is to realize such devices on large, flexible and affordable substrates, on which direct growth of nitride semiconductors of sufficient quality is problematic. Several techniques-such as laser lift-off(4,5)-have been investigated to enable the transfer of nitride devices from one substrate to another, but existing methods still have some important disadvantages. Here we demonstrate that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can form a release layer that enables the mechanical transfer of gallium nitride (GaN)-based device structures onto foreign substrates. The h-BN layer serves two purposes: it acts as a buffer layer for the growth of high-quality GaN-based semiconductors, and provides a shear plane that makes it straightforward to release the resulting devices. We illustrate the potential versatility of this approach by using h-BN-buffered sapphire substrates to grow an AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with electron mobility of 1,100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), an InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well structure, and a multiple-quantum-well light-emitting diode. These device structures, ranging in area from five millimetres square to two centimetres square, are then mechanically released from the sapphire substrates and successfully transferred onto other substrates.","[Kobayashi, Yasuyuki; Kumakura, Kazuhide; Akasaka, Tetsuya; Makimoto, Toshiki] Nippon Telegraph & Tel Corp 3 1, NTT Basic Res Labs, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan","Kobayashi, Y (reprint author), Nippon Telegraph & Tel Corp 3 1, NTT Basic Res Labs, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan.",kobayashi.yasuyuki@lab.ntt.co.jp,"KUMAKURA, Kazuhide/C-2432-2011; Kobayashi, Yasuyuki/G-4750-2014; Akasaka, Tetsuya/N-5822-2015",,,,,28,103,105,18,231,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Apr,2012,484,7393,,,,,223,227,,10.1038/nature10970,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,930OV,WOS:000303149900031,22498627,No,,,11/20/17

These links are extensive, influencing a range of climate processes such as hurricane activity(2) and African Sahel(3-5) and Amazonian(5) droughts. The variability is distinct from historical global-mean temperature changes and is commonly attributed to natural ocean oscillations(6-10). A number of studies have provided evidence that aerosols can influence long-term changes in sea surface temperatures(11,12), but climate models have so far failed to reproduce these interactions(6,9) and the role of aerosols in decadal variability remains unclear. Here we use a state-of-the-art Earth system climate model to show that aerosol emissions and periods of volcanic activity explain 76 per cent of the simulated multidecadal variance in detrended 1860-2005 North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. After 1950, simulated variability is within observational estimates; our estimates for 1910-1940 capture twice the warming of previous generation models but do not explain the entire observed trend. Other processes, such as ocean circulation, may also have contributed to variability in the early twentieth century. Mechanistically, we find that inclusion of aerosol-cloud microphysical effects, which were included in few previous multimodel ensembles, dominates the magnitude (80 per cent) and the spatial pattern of the total surface aerosol forcing in the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions influenced a range of societally important historical climate events such as peaks in hurricane activity and Sahel drought. Decadal-scale model predictions of regional Atlantic climate will probably be improved by incorporating aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and estimates of future concentrations of aerosols, emissions of which are directly addressable by policy actions.","[Booth, Ben B.

Receptor and motor complexes are coupled by the diffusible protein CheY-P. Receptor output (the steady-state concentration of CheY-P) varies from cell to cell(5). However, the motor is ultrasensitive, with a narrow operating range of CheY-P concentrations(6). How the match between receptor output and motor input might be optimized is unclear. Here we show that the motor can shift its operating range by changing its composition. The number of FliM subunits in the C-ring increases in response to a decrement in the concentration of CheY-P, increasing motor sensitivity. This shift in sensitivity explains the slow partial adaptation observed in mutants that lack the receptor methyltransferase and methylesterase(7,8) and why motors show signal-dependent FliM turnover(9).

Here we show that two Drosophila Teneurins, Ten-m and Ten-a, are required for neuromuscular synapse organization and target selection. Ten-a is presynaptic whereas Ten-m is mostly postsynaptic; neuronal Ten-a and muscle Ten-m form a complex in vivo. Pre- or postsynaptic Teneurin perturbations cause severe synapse loss and impair many facets of organization trans-synaptically and cell autonomously. These include defects in active zone apposition, release sites, membrane and vesicle organization, and synaptic transmission. Moreover, the presynaptic microtubule and postsynaptic spectrin cytoskeletons are severely disrupted, suggesting a mechanism whereby Teneurins organize the cytoskeleton, which in turn affects other aspects of synapse development. Supporting this, Ten-m physically interacts with a-Spectrin. Genetic analyses of teneurin and neuroligin reveal that they have differential roles that synergize to promote synapse assembly. Finally, at elevated endogenous levels, Ten-m regulates target selection between specific motor neurons and muscles. Our study identifies the Teneurins as a key bi-directional trans-synaptic signal involved in general synapse organization, and demonstrates that proteins such as these can also regulate target selection.","[Mosca, Timothy J.; Hong, Weizhe; Dani, Vardhan S.; Favaloro, Vincenzo; Luo, Liqun] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Mosca, TJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tmosca@stanford.edu,"Hong, Weizhe/E-3164-2010","Hong, Weizhe/0000-0003-1523-8575; Mosca, Timothy/0000-0003-3485-0719","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 DC-005982, 5T32 NS007280, HD007249]","We thank H.

Current climate change has already altered global plant phenology and distribution(2,3), and projected increases in temperature pose a significant challenge to agriculture(4). Despite the important role of temperature on plant development, the underlying pathways are unknown. It has previously been shown that thermal acceleration of flowering is dependent on the florigen, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)(5,6). How this occurs is, however, not understood, because the major pathway known to upregulate FT, the photoperiod pathway, is not required for thermal acceleration of flowering(6). Here we demonstrate a direct mechanism by which increasing temperature causes the bHLH transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) to activate FT. Our findings provide a new understanding of how plants control their timing of reproduction in response to temperature. Flowering time is an important trait in crops as well as affecting the life cycles of pollinator species. A molecular understanding of how temperature affects flowering will be important for mitigating the effects of climate change.","[Kumar, S.

Impaired spiral artery remodelling has been implicated in pre-eclampsia, a major complication of pregnancy, for a long time but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear(1,2). Corin (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme) is a cardiac protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac hormone that is important in regulating blood pressure(3). Unexpectedly, corin expression was detected in the pregnant uterus(4). Here we identify a new function of corin and ANP in promoting trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling. We show that pregnant corin-or ANP-deficient mice developed high blood pressure and proteinuria, characteristics of pre-eclampsia. In these mice, trophoblast invasion and uterine spiral artery remodelling were markedly impaired. Consistent with this, the ANP potently stimulated human trophoblasts in invading Matrigels. In patients with pre-eclampsia, uterine Corin messenger RNA and protein levels were significantly lower than that in normal pregnancies. Moreover, we have identified Corin gene mutations inpre-eclamptic patients, which decreased corin activity in processing pro-ANP. These results indicate that corin and ANP are essential for physiological changes at the maternal-fetal interface, suggesting that defects in corin and ANP function may contribute to pre-eclampsia.","[Cui, Yujie; Wang, Wei; Lou, Jinglei; Srinivasan, Dinesh Kumar; Peng, Jianhao; Chen, Shenghan; Wu, Shannon; Wu, Qingyu] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Dong, Ningzheng; Liu, Meng; Fang, Chaodong; Liu, Zhenzhen; Dong, Liang; Zhou, Yiqing; Wu, Qingyu] Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Jiangsu Inst Hematol, Cyrus Tang Hematol Ctr, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Dong, Ningzheng] Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Jiangsu Inst Hematol, Key Lab Thrombosis & Hemostasis, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Weiwei; Huang, Xiaoyi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Int Peace Matern & Child Hlth Hosp, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China","Wu, QY (reprint author), Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",wuq@ccf.org,"Srinivasan, Dinesh Kumar/A-9872-2008","Srinivasan, Dinesh Kumar/0000-0001-6535-5441; Wu, Qingyu/0000-0003-0561-9315","Ralph Wilson Medical Foundation; Bakken Heart-Brain Institute; National Institutes of Health [HL089298, HD064634]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31070716, 81170247, 31161130356]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","We thank J.

Consequently, genomic processes must be regulated by mechanisms that alter genome function relatively rapidly(1-4). Conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments measure transcription factor occupancy(5), but give no indication of kinetics and are poor predictors of transcription factor function at a given locus. To measure transcription-factor-binding dynamics across the genome, we performed competition ChIP (refs 6, 7) with a sequence-specific Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor, Rap1 (ref. 8). Rap1-binding dynamics and Rap1 occupancy were only weakly correlated (R-2 = 0.14), but binding dynamics were more strongly linked to function than occupancy. Long Rap1 residence was coupled to transcriptional activation, whereas fast binding turnover, which we refer to as 'treadmilling', was linked to low transcriptional output. Thus, DNA-binding events that seem identical by conventional ChIP may have different underlying modes of interaction that lead to opposing functional outcomes. We propose that transcription factor binding turnover is a major point of regulation in determining the functional consequences of transcription factor binding, and is mediated mainly by control of competition between transcription factors and nucleosomes. Our model predicts a clutch-like mechanism that rapidly engages a treadmilling transcription factor into a stable binding state, or vice versa, to modulate transcription factor function.","[Lickwar, Colin R.; Hanlon, Sean E.; Lieb, Jason D.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Curriculum Genet & Mol Biol, Dept Biol,Carolina Ctr Genome Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Mueller, Florian; McNally, James G.] NCI, LRBGE, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Mueller, Florian] Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Inst Pasteur, Grp Imagerie & Modelisat, Unite Rech Associee 2582, F-75015 Paris, France","Lieb, JD (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Curriculum Genet & Mol Biol, Dept Biol,Carolina Ctr Genome Sci, CB 3280,408 Fordham Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",jlieb@bio.unc.edu,"Mueller, Florian/C-9075-2012","Mueller, Florian/0000-0002-9622-4396","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01-GM072518]; NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research; Region Ile-de-France in the framework of C'Nano IdF, the nanoscience competence center of Paris Region","We thank T.

At the following proofreading step the ribosome re-examines the tRNA and rejects it if it does not match the A codon(2,3,10-14). It was suggested that universally conserved G530, A1492 and A1493 of 16S ribosomal RNA, critical for tRNA binding in the Asite(15-17), actively monitor cognate tRNA(18), and that recognition of the correct codon-anticodon duplex induces an overall ribosome conformational change (domain closure)(19). Here we propose an integrated mechanism for decoding based on six X-ray structures of the 70S ribosome determined at 3.1-3.4A resolution, modelling cognate or near-cognate states of the decoding centre at the proofreading step. We show that the 30S subunit undergoes an identical domain closure upon binding of either cognate or near-cognate tRNA. This conformational change of the 30S subunit forms a decoding centre that constrains the mRNA in such a way that the first two nucleotides of the A codon are limited to form Watson-Crick base pairs. When U center dot G and G center dot U mismatches, generally considered to form wobble base pairs, are at the first or second codon-anticodon position, the decoding centre forces this pair to adopt the geometry close to that of a canonical C center dot G pair. This by itself, or with distortions in the codon-anticodon mini-helix and the anticodon loop, causes the near-cognate tRNA to dissociate from the ribosome.","[Demeshkina, Natalia; Jenner, Lasse; Yusupov, Marat; Yusupova, Gulnara] Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, Dept Biol & Genom Struct, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Demeshkina, Natalia; Jenner, Lasse; Yusupov, Marat; Yusupova, Gulnara] CNRS, UMR7104, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Demeshkina, Natalia; Jenner, Lasse; Yusupov, Marat; Yusupova, Gulnara] INSERM, U964, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Demeshkina, Natalia; Jenner, Lasse; Yusupov, Marat; Yusupova, Gulnara] Univ Strasbourg, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Westhof, Eric] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Biol Mol & Cellulaire, Architecture & Reactivite ARN, F-67084 Strasbourg, France","Yusupov, M (reprint author), Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, Dept Biol & Genom Struct, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",marat@igbmc.fr; gula@igbmc.fr,"Yusupov, Marat/I-6126-2013; Yusupova , Gulnara/E-1877-2014","Yusupov, Marat/0000-0001-5544-0597; Jenner, Lasse/0000-0003-3917-8853","ANR [BLAN07-3_190451, ANR-07-PCVI-0015-01]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale en France; European Commission SPINE2","We are grateful to C.

Many cancer cells express high telomerase activity, and mutations in telomerase subunits are associated with degenerative syndromes including dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anaemia. The therapeutic value of altering telomerase activity thus provides ample impetus to study the biogenesis and regulation of this enzyme in human cells and model systems. We have previously identified a precursor of the fission yeast telomerase RNA subunit (TER1)(1) and demonstrated that the mature 3'-end is generated by the spliceosome in a single cleavage reaction akin to the first step of splicing(2). Directly upstream and partly overlapping with the spliceosomal cleavage site is a putative binding site for Sm proteins. Sm and like-Sm (LSm) proteins belong to an ancient family of RNA-binding proteins represented in all three domains of life(3). Members of this family form ring complexes on specific sets of target RNAs and have critical roles in their biogenesis, function and turnover. Here we demonstrate that the canonical Sm ring and the Lsm2-8 complex sequentially associate with fission yeast TER1. The Sm ring binds to the TER1 precursor, stimulates spliceosomal cleavage and promotes the hypermethylation of the 5'-cap by Tgs1. Sm proteins are then replaced by the Lsm2-8 complex, which promotes the association with the catalytic subunit and protects the mature 3'-end of TER1 from exonucleolytic degradation. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur during telomerase biogenesis and characterize roles for Sm and Lsm complexes as well as for the methylase Tgs1.","[Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Blanchette, Marco; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Blanchette, Marco] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Baumann, P (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",peb@stowers.org,,"Baumann, Peter/0000-0003-4892-1485",Stowers Institute for Medical Research; American Heart Association,"We thank S.

This seemingly straightforward reaction requires large, multimodular enzyme complexes that adopt multiple conformations to alternately activate, protect and perform catalysis on the reactive B-12 cofactor. Crystal structures determined thus far have provided structural information for only fragments of these complexes(4-12), inspiring speculation about the overall protein assembly and conformational movements inherent to activity. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of a complete 220 kDa complex that contains all enzymes responsible for B-12-dependent methyl transfer, namely the corrinoid iron-sulphur protein and its methyltransferase from the model acetogen Moorella thermoacetica. These structures provide the first three-dimensional depiction of all protein modules required for the activation, protection and catalytic steps of B-12-dependent methyl transfer. In addition, the structures capture B-12 at multiple locations between its 'resting' and catalytic positions, allowing visualization of the dramatic protein rearrangements that enable methyl transfer and identification of the trajectory for B-12 movement within the large enzyme scaffold. The structures are also presented alongside in crystallo spectroscopic data, which confirm enzymatic activity within crystals and demonstrate the largest known conformational movements of proteins in a crystalline state. Taken together, this work provides a model for the molecular juggling that accompanies turnover and helps explain why such an elaborate protein framework is required for such a simple, yet biologically essential reaction.","[Kung, Yan; Ando, Nozomi; Doukov, Tzanko I.; Blasiak, Leah C.; Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ando, Nozomi; Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bender, Guenes; Ragsdale, Stephen W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Seravalli, Javier] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biochem, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Drennan, CL (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cdrennan@mit.edu,,"Kung, Yan/0000-0002-6132-7969","National Institutes of Health [GM69857, GM39451]; MIT Energy Initiative; National Center for Research Resources at the National Institutes of Health [RR-15301]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank J.

Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation. Differences between the respective temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere parallel variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation recorded in marine sediments. These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.","[Shakun, Jeremy D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shakun, Jeremy D.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Clark, Peter U.; Marcott, Shaun A.; Mix, Alan C.; Schmittner, Andreas] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [He, Feng; Liu, Zhengyu] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Zhengyu] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Zhengyu] Peking Univ, Lab Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Otto-Bliesner, Bette] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Bard, Edouard] Univ Aix Marseille, CNRS, Coll France, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France","Shakun, JD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",shakun@fas.harvard.edu,"He, Feng/B-3583-2008; Bard, Edouard/G-7717-2014; Marcott, Shaun/L-7098-2015; Schmittner, Andreas/O-9647-2015","He, Feng/0000-0002-3355-6406; Schmittner, Andreas/0000-0002-8376-0843",Office of Science of the Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; NSF [AGS-0602395]; NOAA,"Discussions with numerous people, including E.

Here we develop a high-quality reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks. By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine-freshwater divergence. Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine-freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive evolution in nature.","[Grabherr, Manfred G.; Russell, Pamela; Mauceli, Evan; Johnson, Jeremy; Swofford, Ross; Pirun, Mono; Zody, Michael C.; Lander, Eric S.; Di Palma, Federica; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Jones, Felicity C.; Chan, Yingguang Frank; Miller, Craig T.; Summers, Brian R.; Knecht, Anne K.; Brady, Shannon D.; Zhang, Haili; Pollen, Alex A.; Howes, Timothy; Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Beckman Ctr B300, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Grabherr, Manfred G.; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Biochem & Microbiol, Sci Life Lab Uppsala, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; [White, Simon; Searle, Stephen] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Birney, Ewan] European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Schmutz, Jeremy; Grimwood, Jane; Dickson, Mark C.; Myers, Richard M.] HudsonAlpha Inst Biotechnol, Huntsville, AL 35806 USA; [Amemiya, Chris] Benaroya Res Inst Virginia Mason, Dept Mol Genet, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Lindblad-Toh, K (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",kersli@broad.mit.edu; kingsley@stanford.edu,"Schmutz, Jeremy/N-3173-2013","Schmutz, Jeremy/0000-0001-8062-9172; Howes, Timothy/0000-0002-0370-0200; Jones, Felicity/0000-0002-5027-1031; Birney, Ewan/0000-0001-8314-8497; Russell, Pamela/0000-0003-2997-6392",National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); NHGRI CEGS [P50-HG002568]; Stanford Affymetrix Bio-X; Jane Coffins Childs Fund; NSF; NDSEG; ESF,"Stickleback sequencing at Broad Institute was supported by grants from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).

Here we optically imaged the spatial and temporal activity patterns of neuronal populations in mice performing a PPC-dependent task that combined a perceptual decision and memory-guided navigation in a virtual environment. Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales (<100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the PPC may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.","[Harvey, Christopher D.; Coen, Philip; Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Bezos Ctr Neural Circuit Dynam, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Harvey, Christopher D.; Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Harvey, Christopher D.; Coen, Philip; Tank, David W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Harvey, CD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",christopher_harvey@hms.harvard.edu; dwtank@princeton.edu,,"COEN, PHILIP/0000-0003-1495-1061","NIH [R01-MH083686, RC1-NS068148]; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface","We thank D.

Their origin has been ascribed to selection of random rearrangements, targeted DNA damage, or frequent nuclear interactions between translocation partners; however, the relative contribution of each of these elements has not been measured directly or on a large scale. Here we examine the role of nuclear architecture and frequency of DNA damage in the genesis of chromosomal translocations by measuring these parameters simultaneously in cultured mouse B lymphocytes. In the absence of recurrent DNA damage, translocations between Igh or Myc and all other genes are directly related to their contact frequency. Conversely, translocations associated with recurrent site-directed DNA damage are proportional to the rate of DNA break formation, as measured by replication protein A accumulation at the site of damage. Thus, non-targeted rearrangements reflect nuclear organization whereas DNA break formation governs the location and frequency of recurrent translocations, including those driving B-cell malignancies.","[Klein, Isaac; Jankovic, Mila; Oliveira, Thiago; Bothmer, Anne; Robbiani, Davide F.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Hakim, Ofir; Voss, Ty C.; Hager, Gordon L.] NCI, Lab Receptor Biol & Gene Express, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Resch, Wolfgang; Yamane, Arito; Kieffer-Kwon, Kyong-Rim; Ansarah-Sobrinho, Camilo; Liang, Genqing; Cobell, Jesse; Nakahashi, Hirotaka; Casellas, Rafael] NCI, NIAMS, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Oliveira, Thiago] Univ Sao Paulo, Med Sch Ribeirao Preto, Dept Genet, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Stem Cells & Cell Therapy, BR-14051140 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Oliveira, Thiago] Ctr Cell Based Therapy, BR-14051140 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Nussenzweig, Andre] NCI, Lab Genome Integr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Casellas, Rafael] NCI, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Nussenzweig, MC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",nussen@rockefeller.edu; casellar@mail.nih.gov,"perumal, murugiah/D-1565-2012; Yamane, Arito/A-2959-2013","Oliveira, Thiago/0000-0002-2654-0879","Starr Foundation; NIH [AI037526]; NIAMS; NCI, NIH","We thank members of the Casellas and Nussenzweig laboratories for discussions; G.

There was accordingly considerable interest when the RR Lyrae star OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792 (referred to here as RRLYR-02792) was found to be a member of an eclipsing binary system(4), because the mass of the pulsator (hitherto constrained only by models) could be unambiguously determined. Here we report that RRLYR-02792 has a mass of 0.26 solar masses (M-circle dot) and therefore cannot be a classical RR Lyrae star. Using models, we find that its properties are best explained by the evolution of a close binary system that started with 1.4M(circle dot) and 0.8M(circle dot) stars orbiting each other with an initial period of 2.9 days. Mass exchange over 5.4 billion years produced the observed system, which is now in a very short-lived phase where the physical properties of the pulsator happen to place it in the same instability strip of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as that occupied by RR Lyrae stars. We estimate that only 0.2 per cent of RR Lyrae stars may be contaminated by systems similar to this one, which implies that distances measured with RR Lyrae stars should not be significantly affected by these binary interlopers.","[Pietrzynski, G.; Gieren, W.; Graczyk, D.; Pilecki, B.; Gorski, M.; Konorski, P.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Concepcion, Chile; [Pietrzynski, G.; Stepien, K.; Pilecki, B.; Udalski, A.; Soszynski, I.; Gorski, M.; Konorski, P.] Univ Warsaw Observ, PL-00478 Warsaw, Poland; [Thompson, I.

Recent proposals(6-9) suggest that laser oscillators which use very narrow optical transitions in atoms can be orders of magnitude more spectrally pure than present lasers. Lasers of this high spectral purity are predicted to operate deep in the 'bad-cavity', or superradiant, regime, where the bare atomic linewidth is much less than the cavity linewidth. Here we demonstrate a Raman superradiant laser source in which spontaneous synchronization of more than one million rubidium-87 atomic dipoles is continuously sustained by less than 0.2 photons on average inside the optical cavity. By operating at low intracavity photon number, we demonstrate isolation of the collective atomic dipole from the environment by a factor of more than ten thousand, as characterized by cavity frequency pulling measurements. The emitted light has a frequency linewidth, measured relative to the Raman dressing laser, that is less than that of single-particle decoherence linewidths and more than ten thousand times less than the quantum linewidth limit typically applied to 'good-cavity' optical lasers(10), for which the cavity linewidth is much less than the atomic linewidth. These results demonstrate several key predictions for future superradiant lasers, which could be used to improve the stability of passive atomic clocks(3) and which may lead to new searches for physics beyond the standard model(11,12).","[Bohnet, Justin G.; Chen, Zilong; Weiner, Joshua M.; Meiser, Dominic; Holland, Murray J.; Thompson, James K.] NIST, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bohnet, Justin G.; Chen, Zilong; Weiner, Joshua M.; Meiser, Dominic; Holland, Murray J.; Thompson, James K.] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Thompson, JK (reprint author), NIST, JILA, 440 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jkt@jila.colorado.edu,"Chen, Zilong/H-3405-2011","Chen, Zilong/0000-0003-4467-8537",NSF PFC; NIST; ARO; DARPA QuASaR through ARO; NSF; NSF GRF; A*STAR Singapore,"We thank J.

An idle quantum bit (qubit) can be efficiently insulated from the outside world by dynamical decoupling(3), as has recently been demonstrated for individual solid-state qubits(4-9). However, protecting qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate is a non-trivial problem(3,10,11): in general, the decoupling disrupts the interqubit dynamics and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly salient for hybrid systems(12-22), in which different types of qubit evolve and decohere at very different rates. Here we present the integration of dynamical decoupling into quantum gates for a standard hybrid system, the electron-nuclear spin register. Our design harnesses the internal resonance in the coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and decoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates using a two-qubit register in diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the qubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle qubits. We also perform Grover's quantum search algorithm(1), and achieve fidelities of more than 90% even though the algorithm run-time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of magnitude. Our results directly allow decoherence-protected interface gates between different types of solid-state qubit. Ultimately, quantum gates with integrated decoupling may reach the accuracy threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information processing with solid-state devices(1,11).","[Wang, Z. H.; Dobrovitski, V.

The first and largest of these events, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is characterized by a massive input of carbon, ocean acidification(2) and an increase in global temperature of about 5 degrees C within a few thousand years(3). Although various explanations for the PETM have been proposed(4-6), a satisfactory model that accounts for the source, magnitude and timing of carbon release at the PETM and successive hyperthermals remains elusive. Here we use a new astronomically calibrated cyclostratigraphic record from central Italy(7) to show that the Early Eocene hyperthermals occurred during orbits with a combination of high eccentricity and high obliquity. Corresponding climate-ecosystem-soil simulations accounting for rising concentrations of background greenhouse gases(8) and orbital forcing show that the magnitude and timing of the PETM and subsequent hyperthermals can be explained by the orbitally triggered decomposition of soil organic carbon in circum-Arctic and Antarctic terrestrial permafrost. This massive carbon reservoir had the potential to repeatedly release thousands of petagrams (10(15) grams) of carbon to the atmosphere-ocean system, once a long-term warming threshold had been reached just before the PETM. Replenishment of permafrost soil carbon stocks following peak warming probably contributed to the rapid recovery from each event(9), while providing a sensitive carbon reservoir for the next hyperthermal(10). As background temperatures continued to rise following the PETM, the areal extent of permafrost steadily declined, resulting in an incrementally smaller available carbon pool and smaller hyperthermals at each successive orbital forcing maximum. A mechanism linking Earth's orbital properties with release of soil carbon from permafrost provides a unifying model accounting for the salient features of the hyperthermals.","[DeConto, Robert M.; Tracy, David] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Galeotti, Simone] Univ Urbino, Earth Life & Environm Sci Dept, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Pagani, Mark] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Schaefer, Kevin; Zhang, Tingjun] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Pollard, David] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Beerling, David J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Zhang, Tingjun] Lanzhou Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab W Chinas Environm Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","DeConto, RM (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",deconto@geo.umass.edu,"Pagani, Mark/B-3233-2008; Beerling, David/C-2840-2009","Beerling, David/0000-0003-1869-4314; Galeotti, Simone/0000-0001-9636-9344","US National Science Foundation [ATM-0513402/0513421, EAR-0628358]; Royal Society","This work was funded by the US National Science Foundation under award ATM-0513402/0513421 to R.M.D. and D.P., and EAR-0628358 to M.P.

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes(11-23).","[Simini, Filippo; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simini, Filippo; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys Biol & Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simini, Filippo; Maritan, Amos] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis G Galilei, CNISM, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Simini, Filippo; Maritan, Amos] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Simini, Filippo] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Inst Phys, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Gonzalez, Marta C.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Barabasi, AL (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",amos.maritan@pd.infn.it; alb@neu.edu,"Gonzalez, Marta/E-9456-2011","Gonzalez, Marta/0000-0002-8482-0318","Cariparo foundation; Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance; US Army Research Laboratory [W911NF-09-2-0053]; Office of Naval Research [N000141010968]; Defense Threat Reduction Agency [WMD BRBAA07-J-2-0035, BRBAA08-Per4-C-2-0033]; James S.

Despite the ubiquity of life in the deep biosphere, the large community sizes and the low energy fluxes in this vast buried ecosystemare not yet understood(1,2). It is not known whether organisms of the deep biosphere are specifically adapted to extremely low energy fluxes or whether most of the observed cells are in a dormant, spore-like state(3). Here we apply a new approach-the D:L-amino-acid model-to quantify the distributions and turnover times of living microbial biomass, endospores and microbial necromass, as well as to determine their role in the sub-seafloor carbon budget. The approach combines sensitive analyses of unique bacterial markers (muramic acid and D-amino acids) and the bacterial endospore marker, dipicolinic acid, with racemization dynamics of stereo-isomeric amino acids. Endospores are as abundant as vegetative cells and microbial activity is extremely low, leading to microbial biomass turnover times of hundreds to thousands of years. We infer from model calculations that biomass production is sustained by organic carbon deposited from the surface photosynthetic world millions of years ago and that microbial necromass is recycled over timescales of hundreds of thousands of years.","[Lomstein, Bente Aa; Langerhuus, Alice T.] Aarhus Univ, Microbiol Sect, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [D'Hondt, Steven; Spivack, Arthur J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Jorgensen, Bo B.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Geomicrobiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Lomstein, BA (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Microbiol Sect, Dept Biosci, Bldg 1540,Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",bente.lomstein@biology.au.dk,"Lomstein, Bente/I-7684-2013; Jorgensen, Bo/C-2214-2013","Jorgensen, Bo/0000-0001-9398-8027","US National Science Foundation; Max Planck Society; Danish National Research Foundation; Danish National Science Research Council; Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; Faculty of Science and Technology at the University of Aarhus","Bacterial cultures were provided by H.

The disease is characterized inmost cases by mutation of the MECP2 gene, which encodes a methyl-CpG-binding protein(1-5). Although MECP2 is expressed in many tissues, the disease is generally attributed to a primary neuronal dysfunction(6). However, as shown recently, glia, specifically astrocytes, also contribute to Rett pathophysiology. Here we examine the role of another form of glia, microglia, in a murine model of Rett syndrome. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiation-conditioned Mecp2-null hosts resulted in engraftment of brain parenchyma by bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells of microglial phenotype, and arrest of disease development. However, when cranial irradiation was blocked by lead shield, and microglial engraftment was prevented, disease was not arrested. Similarly, targeted expression of MECP2 in myeloid cells, driven by Lysm(cre) on an Mecp2-null background, markedly attenuated disease symptoms. Thus, through multiple approaches, wild-type Mecp2-expressing microglia within the context of an Mecp2-null male mouse arrested numerous facets of disease pathology: lifespan was increased, breathing patterns were normalized, apnoeas were reduced, body weight was increased to near that of wild type, and locomotor activity was improved. Mecp2(+/-) females also showed significant improvements as a result of wild-type microglial engraftment. These benefits mediated by wild-type microglia, however, were diminished when phagocytic activity was inhibited pharmacologically by using annexin V to block phosphatydilserine residues on apoptotic targets, thus preventing recognition and engulfment by tissue-resident phagocytes. These results suggest the importance of microglial phagocytic activity in Rett syndrome. Our data implicate microglia as major players in the pathophysiology of this devastating disorder, and suggest that bone marrow transplantation might offer a feasible therapeutic approach for it.","[Derecki, Noel C.; Cronk, James C.; Lu, Zhenjie; Xu, Eric; Kipnis, Jonathan] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Derecki, Noel C.; Cronk, James C.; Kipnis, Jonathan] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Cronk, James C.; Kipnis, Jonathan] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Med Scientist Training Program, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Xu, Eric] Univ Virginia, Undergrad Sch Arts & Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Abbott, Stephen B.

The resultant angiogenic expansion of the local vasculature can promote physiological and pathological growth processes(1). Previous work has uncovered that the VEGF and Notch pathways are tightly linked. Signalling triggered by VEGF-A (also known as VEGF) has been shown to induce expression of the Notch ligand DLL4 in angiogenic vessels and, most prominently, in the tip of endothelial sprouts(2,3). DLL4 activates Notch in adjacent cells, which suppresses the expression of VEGF receptors and thereby restrains endothelial sprouting and proliferation(2,4-6). Here we show, by using inducible loss-of-function genetics in combination with inhibitors in vivo, that DLL4 protein expression in retinal tip cells is only weakly modulated by VEGFR2 signalling. Surprisingly, Notch inhibition also had no significant impact on VEGFR2 expression and induced deregulated endothelial sprouting and proliferation even in the absence of VEGFR2, which is the most important VEGF-A receptor and is considered to be indispensable for these processes. By contrast, VEGFR3, the main receptor for VEGF-C, was strongly modulated by Notch. VEGFR3 kinase-activity inhibitors but not ligand-blocking antibodies suppressed the sprouting of endothelial cells that had low Notch signalling activity. Our results establish that VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 are regulated in a highly differential manner by Notch. We propose that successful anti-angiogenic targeting of these receptors and their ligands will strongly depend on the status of endothelial Notch signalling.","[Benedito, Rui; Rocha, Susana F.; Woeste, Marina; Zamykal, Martin; Adams, Ralf H.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Benedito, Rui; Rocha, Susana F.; Woeste, Marina; Zamykal, Martin; Adams, Ralf H.] Univ Munster, Fac Med, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Radtke, Freddy] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res ISREC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Casanovas, Oriol] IDIBELL, Catalan Inst Oncol, Translat Res Lab, Lhospitalet De Llobregat 08907, Spain; [Duarte, Antonio] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Fac Vet Med, Interdisciplinary Ctr Res Anim Hlth CIISA, P-1300474 Lisbon, Portugal; [Pytowski, Bronislaw] ImClone Syst, New York, NY 10014 USA","Adams, RH (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",rui.benedito@mpi-muenster.mpg.de; ralf.adams@mpi-muenster.mpg.de,"CIISA, FMV/D-2242-2016; Benedito, Rui/G-8295-2012","Benedito, Rui/0000-0003-2458-3055; Duarte, Antonio/0000-0002-9255-3635; Casanovas, Oriol/0000-0002-4298-3995; Radtke, Freddy/0000-0003-4315-4045","Max Planck Society; University of Munster; German Research Foundation [SFB 629, SPP 1190]","We thank M.

Effector proteins influence DNA-templated processes, including transcription, DNA recombination and DNA repair; however, no effector functions have yet been identified within the mammalian machinery that regulate DNA replication. Here we show that ORC1-a component of ORC (origin of replication complex), which mediates pre-DNA replication licensing(2)-contains a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain that specifically recognizes histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me2). Recognition of H4K20me2 is a property common to BAH domains present within diverse metazoan ORC1 proteins. Structural studies reveal that the specificity of the BAH domain for H4K20me2 is mediated by a dynamic aromatic dimethyl-lysine-binding cage and multiple intermolecular contacts involving the bound peptide. H4K20me2 is enriched at replication origins, and abrogating ORC1 recognition of H4K20me2 in cells impairs ORC1 occupancy at replication origins, ORC chromatin loading and cell-cycle progression. Mutation of the ORC1 BAH domain has been implicated in the aetiology of Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS)(3,4), a form of primordial dwarfism(5), and ORC1 depletion in zebrafish results in an MGS-like phenotype(4). We find that wild-type human ORC1, but not ORC1-H4K20me2-binding mutants, rescues the growth retardation of orc1 morphants. Moreover, zebrafish depleted of H4K20me2 have diminished body size, mirroring the phenotype of orc1 morphants. Together, our results identify the BAH domain as a novel methyl-lysine-binding module, thereby establishing the first direct link between histone methylation and the metazoan DNA replication machinery, and defining a pivotal aetiological role for the canonical H4K20me2 mark, via ORC1, in primordial dwarfism.","[Song, Jikui; Ishibe-Murakami, Satoko; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kuo, Alex J.; Cheung, Peggie; Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yamazoe, Sayumi; Chen, James K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Patel, DJ (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",pateld@mskcc.org; ogozani@stanford.edu,"perumal, murugiah/D-1565-2012; Chen, James/G-9972-2011","Chen, James/0000-0002-9220-8436",Abby Rockefeller Mauze Foundation; STARR Foundation; Maloris Foundation; Genentech Foundation; Ellison Senior Scholar in Aging Award;  [R01 GM079641];  [DP1 OD003792],"We thank R.

The molecular machinery responsible for myonuclear positioning is not known. Improperly positioned nuclei are a hallmark of numerous diseases of muscle(2), including centronuclear myopathies(3), but it is unclear whether correct nuclear positioning is necessary for muscle function. Here we identify the microtubule-associated protein ensconsin (Ens)/microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) and kinesin heavy chain (Khc)/Kif5b as essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of myonuclear positioning in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes. We find that these proteins interact physically and that expression of the Kif5b motor domain fused to the MAP7 microtubule-binding domain rescues nuclear positioning defects in MAP7-depleted cells. This suggests that MAP7 links Kif5b to the microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear positioning. Finally, we show that myonuclear positioning is physiologically important. Drosophila ens mutant larvae have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear positioning, and these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific expression of Ens. We conclude that improper nuclear positioning contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous fashion.","[Gache, Vincent; Cadot, Bruno; Gomes, Edgar R.] Univ Paris 06, INSERM, UMR S 787, F-75634 Paris, France; [Metzger, Thomas; Xu, Mu; Folker, Eric S.; Richardson, Brian E.; Baylies, Mary K.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Program Dev Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Metzger, Thomas; Baylies, Mary K.] Cornell Univ, Weill Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Gomes, Edgar R.] Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, Inst Myol, F-75013 Paris, France","Gomes, ER (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, INSERM, UMR S 787, F-75634 Paris, France.",edgar.gomes@upmc.fr; m-baylies@ski.mskcc.org,"CADOT, bruno/E-1710-2013; Gomes, Edgar/D-9000-2015; GACHE, Vincent/M-9556-2015","CADOT, bruno/0000-0002-1888-3898; Gomes, Edgar/0000-0002-6941-4872; GACHE, Vincent/0000-0002-2928-791X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM056989, GM0781318]; Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA); NIH [T32 BM008539]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); Region Ile-de-France; INSERM Avenir; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","We thank K.

The AAA+ ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein regulates ciliary trafficking(2), mitotic spindle formation(3) and organelle transport(4), and dissecting its precise functions has been challenging because of its rapid timescale of action and the lack of cell-permeable, chemical modulators. Here we describe the discovery of ciliobrevins, the first specific small-molecule antagonists of cytoplasmic dynein. Ciliobrevins perturb protein trafficking within the primary cilium, leading to their malformation and Hedgehog signalling blockade. Ciliobrevins also prevent spindle pole focusing, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, melanosome aggregation and peroxisome motility in cultured cells. We further demonstrate the ability of ciliobrevins to block dynein-dependent microtubule gliding and ATPase activity in vitro. Ciliobrevins therefore will be useful reagents for studying cellular processes that require this microtubule motor and may guide the development of additional AAA+ ATPase superfamily inhibitors.","[Firestone, Ari J.; Chen, James K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Weinger, Joshua S.; Maldonado, Maria; Langston, Lance D.; O'Donnell, Michael; Kapoor, Tarun M.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chem & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Barlan, Kari; Gelfand, Vladimir I.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Chen, JK (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kapoor@rockefeller.edu; jameschen@stanford.edu,"Chen, James/G-9972-2011","Chen, James/0000-0002-9220-8436; Gelfand, Vladimir/0000-0002-6361-2798","National Institutes of Health [R01 CA136574, R01 GM65933, R01 GM71772, R01 GM52111]","We thank T.

The popular explanation for this and other paradoxes of mantle geochemistry, a hidden layer deep in the mantle enriched in incompatible elements, is inconsistent with the heat flux carried by mantle plumes.

Some such records suggest that the last deglaciation was punctuated by a dramatic period of sea-level rise, of about 20 metres, in less than 500 years. Controversy about the amplitude and timing of this meltwater pulse (MWP-1A) has, however, led to uncertainty about the source of the melt water and its temporal and causal relationships with the abrupt climate changes of the deglaciation. Here we show that MWP-1A started no earlier than 14,650 years ago and ended before 14,310 years ago, making it coeval with the Bolling warming. Our results, based on corals drilled offshore from Tahiti during Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Expedition 310, reveal that the increase in sea level at Tahiti was between 12 and 22 metres, with a most probable value between 14 and 18 metres, establishing a significant meltwater contribution from the Southern Hemisphere.

In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines-which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers-with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.","[Garnett, Mathew J.; Heidorn, Sonja J.; Greenman, Chris D.; Lau, King Wai; Thompson, I.

Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012",,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",,31,17,17,5,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Mar,2012,483,7391,,,,,576,579,,10.1038/nature10919,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,915EF,WOS:000302006100034,22460903,No,,,11/20/17

Such recollisions result in the emission of very energetic photons by means of high-order-harmonic generation, which has been observed in atomic and molecular gases(5-7) as well as in a bulk crystal(8). An exciton is an atom-like excitation of a solid in which an electron that is excited from the valence band is bound by the Coulomb interaction to the hole it left behind(9,10). It has been predicted that recollisions between electrons and holes in excitons will result in a new phenomenon: high-order-sideband generation(11,12). In this process, excitons are created by a weak near-infrared laser of frequency f(NIR). An intense laser field at a much lower frequency, f(THz), then removes the electron from the exciton and causes it to recollide with the resulting hole. New emission is predicted to occur as sidebands of frequency f(NIR) + 12nf(THz), wheren is an integer that can be much greater than one. Here we report the observation of high-order-sideband generation in semiconductor quantum wells. Sidebands are observed up to eighteenth order (+18f(THz), or n 59). The intensity of the high-order sidebands decays only weakly with increasing sideband order, confirming the non-perturbative nature of the effect. Sidebands are strongest for linearly polarized terahertz radiation and vanish when the terahertz radiation is circularly polarized. Beyond their fundamental scientific significance, our results suggest a new mechanism for the ultrafast modulation of light, which has potential applications in terabit-rate optical communications.","[Zaks, B.; Sherwin, M.

Spontaneous coherence of matter waves forms the basis of a number of fundamental phenomena in physics, including superconductivity, superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation(1,2). Spontaneous coherence is the key characteristic of condensation in momentum space(3). Excitons-bound pairs of electrons and holes-form amodel system to explore the quantum physics of cold bosons in solids(4,5). Cold exciton gases can be realized in a system of indirect excitons, which can cool down below the temperature of quantum degeneracy owing to their long lifetimes(6). Here we report measurements of spontaneous coherence in a gas of indirect excitons. We found that spontaneous coherence of excitons emerges in the region of the macroscopically ordered exciton state(7) and in the region of vortices of linear polarization. The coherence length in these regions is much larger than in a classical gas, indicating a coherent state with a much narrower than classical exciton distribution in momentum space, characteristic of a condensate. A pattern of extended spontaneous coherence is correlated with a pattern of spontaneous polarization, revealing the properties of a multicomponent coherent state. We also observed phase singularities in the coherent exciton gas. All these phenomena emerge when the exciton gas is cooled below a few kelvin.","[High, A. A.; Leonard, J. R.; Hammack, A.

The pathogenesis has for a long time been quite enigmatic, as only very few gene defects were identified in this often lethal tumour(1). Frequently detected gene alterations are limited to MYCN amplification (20%) and ALK activations (7%)(2-5). Here we present a whole-genome sequence analysis of 87 neuroblastoma of all stages. Few recurrent amino-acid-changing mutations were found. In contrast, analysis of structural defects identified a local shredding of chromosomes, known as chromothripsis, in 18% of high-stage neuroblastoma(6). These tumours are associated with a poor outcome. Structural alterations recurrently affected ODZ3, PTPRD and CSMD1, which are involved in neuronal growth cone stabilization(7-9). In addition, ATRX, TIAM1 and a series of regulators of the Rac/Rho pathway were mutated, further implicating defects in neuritogenesis in neuroblastoma. Most tumours with defects in these genes were aggressive high-stage neuroblastomas, but did not carry MYCN amplifications. The genomic landscape of neuroblastoma therefore reveals two novel molecular defects, chromothripsis and neuritogenesis gene alterations, which frequently occur in high-risk tumours.","[Molenaar, Jan J.; Koster, Jan; Zwijnenburg, Danny A.; van Sluis, Peter; Valentijn, Linda J.; van der Ploeg, Ida; Hamdi, Mohamed; van Nes, Johan; Westerman, Bart A.; van Arkel, Jennemiek; Ebus, Marli E.; Haneveld, Franciska; Lakeman, Arjan; Schild, Linda; Molenaar, Piet; Stroeken, Peter; Ora, Ingrid; Santo, Evan E.; Westerhout, Ellen M.; Versteeg, Rogier] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Oncogenom, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Noesel, Max M.] Sophia Childrens Univ Hosp, Erasmus MC, Dept Pediat Oncol Hematol, NL-3015 GJ Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ora, Ingrid] Lund Univ, Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat Oncol & Hematol, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Caron, Huib N.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Emma Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Oncol, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands","Versteeg, R (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Oncogenom, Meibergdreef 9, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.j.molenaar@amc.uva.nl; r.versteeg@amc.uva.nl,,"Ora, Ingrid/0000-0002-3931-4125; Koster, Jan/0000-0002-0890-7585",Villa Joep Foundation; KIKA; Tom Voute Fund; Netherlands Cancer Foundation,"The research in this paper was supported by grants from the Villa Joep Foundation, KIKA, Tom Voute Fund, and the Netherlands Cancer Foundation.

Ablation of these neurons in mice leads to cessation of feeding that is accompanied by activation of Fos in most regions where they project(3-6). Previous experiments have indicated that the ensuing starvation is due to aberrant activation of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and it could be prevented by facilitating GABA(A) receptor signalling in the PBN within a critical adaptation period(5). We speculated that loss of GABA signalling from AgRP-expressing neurons (AgRP neurons) within the PBN results in unopposed excitation of the PBN, which in turn inhibits feeding. However, the source of the excitatory inputs to the PBN was unknown. Here we show that glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and caudal serotonergic neurons control the excitability of PBN neurons and inhibit feeding. Blockade of serotonin (5-HT3) receptor signalling in the NTS by either the chronic administration of ondansetron or the genetic inactivation of Tph2 in caudal serotonergic neurons that project to the NTS protects against starvation when AgRP neurons are ablated. Likewise, genetic inactivation of glutamatergic signalling by the NTS onto N-methyl D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors in the PBN prevents starvation. We also show that suppressing glutamatergic output of the PBN reinstates normal appetite after AgRP neuron ablation, whereas it promotes weight gain without AgRP neuron ablation. Thus we identify the PBN as a hub that integrates signals from several brain regions to bidirectionally modulate feeding and body weight.","[Wu, Qi; Palmiter, Richard D.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Wu, Qi; Palmiter, Richard D.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Clark, Michael S.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Palmiter, RD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",palmiter@uw.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [DA024908],"We thank G.

Whereas several proteins are known to regulate chromatin marks associated with the distinct epigenetic states of cells before and after reprogramming(2,3), the role of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes in reprogramming remains to be determined. To address how chromatin-modifying proteins influence reprogramming, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to target genes in DNA and histone methylation pathways, and identified positive and negative modulators of iPSC generation. Whereas inhibition of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2, including the histone 3 lysine 27 methyltransferase EZH2, reduced reprogramming efficiency, suppression of SUV39H1, YY1 and DOT1L enhanced reprogramming. Specifically, inhibition of the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L by shRNA or a small molecule accelerated reprogramming, significantly increased the yield of iPSC colonies, and substituted for KLF4 and c-Myc (also known as MYC). Inhibition of DOT1L early in the reprogramming process is associated with a marked increase in two alternative factors, NANOG and LIN28, which play essential functional roles in the enhancement of reprogramming. Genome-wide analysis of H3K79me2 distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose H3K79me2 in the initial phases of reprogramming. DOT1L inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state. These findings implicate specific chromatin-modifying enzymes as barriers to or facilitators of reprogramming, and demonstrate how modulation of chromatinmodifying enzymes can be exploited to more efficiently generate iPSCs with fewer exogenous transcription factors.","[Onder, Tamer T.; Cherry, Anne; Cahan, Patrick; Unternaehrer, Juli; Daley, George Q.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Manton Ctr Orphan Dis Res, Div Pediat Hematol & Oncol, Stem Cell Transplantat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Onder, Tamer T.; Cherry, Anne; Cahan, Patrick; Unternaehrer, Juli; Daley, George Q.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Onder, Tamer T.; Cherry, Anne; Cahan, Patrick; Unternaehrer, Juli; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Onder, Tamer T.; Cherry, Anne; Zhu, Nan; Bernt, Kathrin M.; Cahan, Patrick; Unternaehrer, Juli; Armstrong, Scott A.; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Onder, Tamer T.; Cherry, Anne; Cahan, Patrick; Unternaehrer, Juli; Daley, George Q.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kara, Nergis] German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Sinha, Amit U.; Zhu, Nan; Bernt, Kathrin M.; Armstrong, Scott A.; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sinha, Amit U.; Zhu, Nan; Bernt, Kathrin M.; Armstrong, Scott A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mancarci, B.

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available(1). Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens(2).","[Barretina, Jordi; Stransky, Nicolas; Margolin, Adam A.; Kryukov, Gregory V.; Murray, Lauren; Berger, Michael F.; Morais, Paula; Korejwa, Adam; Jane-Valbuena, Judit; Gupta, Supriya; Mahan, Scott; Sougnez, Carrie; Onofrio, Robert C.; Liefeld, Ted; Winckler, Wendy; Reich, Michael; Mesirov, Jill P.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Getz, Gad; Ardlie, Kristin; Meyerson, Matthew; Golub, Todd R.; Garraway, Levi A.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Barretina, Jordi; Jane-Valbuena, Judit; Meyerson, Matthew; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barretina, Jordi; Hatton, Charles; Palescandolo, Emanuele; MacConaill, Laura; Meyerson, Matthew; Golub, Todd R.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Caponigro, Giordano; Venkatesan, Kavitha; Wilson, Christopher J.; Lehar, Joseph; Sonkin, Dmitriy; Reddy, Anupama; Liu, Manway; Monahan, John E.; Meltzer, Jodi; Mapa, Felipa A.; Bric-Furlong, Eva; Raman, Pichai; Aspesi, Peter, Jr.; de Silva, Melanie; Jagtap, Kalpana; Jones, Michael D.; Wang, Li; Myer, Vic E.; Weber, Barbara L.; Porter, Jeff; Warmuth, Markus; Finan, Peter; Morrissey, Michael P.; Sellers, William R.; Schlegel, Robert] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kim, Sungjoon; Thibault, Joseph; Shipway, Aaron; Engels, Ingo H.; Li, Nanxin; Harris, Jennifer L.] Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Cheng, Jill; Yu, Guoying K.; Yu, Jianjun; Chan, Vivien] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Garraway, LA (reprint author), Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",robert.schlegel@novartis.com; Levi_Garraway@dfci.harvard.edu,"Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; Kryukov, Gregory/A-9592-2008; Morrissey, Michael/C-6792-2013","Kryukov, Gregory/0000-0002-6131-9483; Monahan, John/0000-0002-3125-8704; Sonkin, Dmitriy/0000-0002-1649-0652",Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research; National Cancer Institute; Starr Cancer Consortium; NIH,"We thank the staff of the Biological Samples Platform, the Genetic Analysis Platform and the Sequencing Platform at the Broad Institute.

Here we showinhuman andmurine cell lines thatoncogenic levels ofMYC establish a dependence on AMPK-related kinase 5 (ARK5; also known as NUAK1) for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and for cell survival. ARK5 is an upstream regulator of AMPK and limits protein synthesis via inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) signalling pathway. ARK5 also maintains expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and respiratory capacity, which is required for efficient glutamine metabolism. Inhibition of ARK5 leads to a collapse of cellular ATP levels in cells expressing deregulated MYC, inducing multiple pro-apoptotic responses as a secondary consequence. Depletion of ARK5 prolongs survival in MYC-driven mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma, demonstrating that targeting cellular energy homeostasis is a valid therapeutic strategy to eliminate tumour cells that express deregulated MYC.","[Liu, Lidan; Ulbrich, Jannes; Mueller, Judith; Kress, Theresia R.; Muthalagu, Nathiya; Eilers, Martin; Murphy, Daniel J.] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Theodor Boveri Inst, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Wuestefeld, Torsten; Rudalska, Ramona; Zender, Lars] Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Wuestefeld, Torsten; Zender, Lars] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endocrinol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Aeberhard, Lukas; Kempa, Stefan] Berlin Inst Med Syst Biol, Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Rycak, Lukas] Inst Mol Biol & Tumor Res, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Moll, Roland] Univ Marburg, Inst Pathol, D-35033 Marburg, Germany","Eilers, M (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Theodor Boveri Inst, Hubland, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",martin.eilers@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de; daniel.murphy@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"kempa, stefan/C-5213-2008","kempa, stefan/0000-0002-0696-9299; Eilers, Martin/0000-0002-0376-6533; Murphy, Daniel/0000-0002-5538-5468","GROWTHSTOP consortium of the European Union; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Transregio 17, Transregio 77]; Emmy Noether Programme [ZE 545/2-1]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; Senate of Berlin; University of Wuerzburg Graduate School of Life Sciences and the ""Rebirth"" Cluster of Excellence","We thank R.

Although most patients with lung cancer are stratified according to a single oncogenic driver, cancers harbouring identical activating genetic mutations show large variations in their responses to the same targeted therapy(1,3). The biology underlying this heterogeneity is not well understood, and the impact of co-existing genetic mutations, especially the loss of tumour suppressors(5-) (9), has not been fully explored. Here we use genetically engineeredmousemodels to conduct a ` co-clinical' trial that mirrors an ongoing human clinical trial in patients with KRAS-mutant lung cancers. This trial aims to determine if the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244)(10) increases the efficacy of docetaxel, a standard of care chemotherapy. Our studies demonstrate that concomitant loss of either p53 (also known as Tp53) or Lkb1 (also known as Stk11), two clinically relevant tumour suppressors(6,9,11,12), markedly impaired the response of Kras-mutant cancers to docetaxel monotherapy. We observed that the addition of selumetinib provided substantial benefit for mice with lung cancer caused by Kras and Kras and p53 mutations, but mice with Kras and Lkb1 mutations had primary resistance to this combination therapy. Pharmacodynamic studies, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), identified biological markers in mice and patients that provide a rationale for the differential efficacy of these therapies in the different genotypes. These co-clinical results identify predictive genetic biomarkers that should be validated by interrogating samples from patients enrolled on the concurrent clinical trial. These studies also highlight the rationale for synchronous co-clinical trials, not only to anticipate the results of ongoing human clinical trials, but also to generate clinically relevant hypotheses that can inform the analysis and design of human studies.","[Chen, Zhao; Ebi, Hiromichi; Liu, Yan; Xu, Chunxiao; Jaenne, Pasi A.; Engelman, Jeffrey A.; Wong, Kwok-Kin] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Zhao; Cheng, Katherine; Walton, Zandra; Liu, Yan; Ouyang, Jing; Gao, Peng; Woo, Michele S.; Xu, Chunxiao; Yanagita, Masahiko; Altabef, Abigail; Yao, Catherine; Butaney, Mohit; Jackman, David; Jaenne, Pasi A.; Wong, Kwok-Kin] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Zhao; Cheng, Katherine; Walton, Zandra; Liu, Yan; Gao, Peng; Xu, Chunxiao; Demetri, George D.; Wong, Kwok-Kin] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Harvard Canc Ctr, Ludwig Ctr Dana Farber, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Yuchuan; Tupper, Tanya; Sun, Yanping; Saur, Amy; Kung, Andrew L.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Lurie Family Imaging Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Yuchuan; Sun, Yanping; Nishino, Mizuki] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Imaging, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Yuchuan; Nishino, Mizuki] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ebi, Hiromichi; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Engelman, Jeffrey A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Shimamura, Takeshi] Loyola Univ Chicago, Stritch Sch Med, Inst Oncol, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Therapeut, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Li, Jie] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat & Stat Lab, Ctr Survey Stat & Methodol, Ames, IA 50010 USA; [Wang, Shumei; Lee, Charles; Chirieac, Lucian R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nakada, Yuji; Pena, Christopher G.; Castrillon, Diego H.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Nakada, Yuji; Pena, Christopher G.; Castrillon, Diego H.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Simmons Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Franchetti, Yoko] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Dana Farber Canc Inst,Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cameron, Michael D.] Scripps Res Inst, Translat Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Hayes, D.

UBC13 (also known as UBE2N) is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that heterodimerizes withUEV1A(2) (also knownasUBE2V1) and synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin (K63Ub) chains at DSB sites in concert with the ubiquitin ligase (E3), RNF168 (ref. 3). K63Ub synthesis is regulated in a non-canonicalmanner by the deubiquitinating enzyme, OTUB1 (OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehydebinding protein 1), which binds preferentially to the UBC13 similar to Ub thiolester(4). Residues amino-terminal to the OTU domain, which had been implicated in ubiquitin binding(4), are required for binding to UBC13 similar to Ub and inhibition of K63Ub synthesis(5). Here we describe structural and biochemical studies elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. We unexpectedly find that OTUB1 binding to UBC13 Ub is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13 similar to Ub, while at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A in a manner that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an OTUB1-UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a chemical UBC13 similar to Ub conjugate show that binding of free ubiquitin to OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of a ubiquitinbinding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13 similar to Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be important for ubiquitin transfer(6,7). The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. The general features of the inhibition mechanism explain how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes4 in a non-catalytic manner.","[Wiener, Reuven; Zhang, Xiangbin; Wang, Tao; Wolberger, Cynthia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Wiener, Reuven; Zhang, Xiangbin; Wang, Tao; Wolberger, Cynthia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Wolberger, C (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",cwolberg@jhmi.edu,,,"US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Science [Y1-GM-1104]","We thank E.

When bacteria enter host cells and replicate intracellularly, the host cells sense the invading bacteria as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by way of various pattern recognition receptors. As a result, the host cells induce alarm signals that activate the innate immune system(1). Therefore, bacteria must modulate host inflammatory signalling and dampen these alarm signals(2-4.) How pathogens do this after invading epithelial cells remainsunclear, however. Herewe showthat OspI, a Shigella flexneri effector encoded by ORF169b on the large plasmid and delivered by the type III secretion system, dampens acute inflammatory responses during bacterial invasion by suppressing the tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated signalling pathway. OspI is a glutamine deamidase that selectively deamidates the glutamine residue at position 100 in UBC13 to a glutamic acid residue. Consequently, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity required for TRAF6 activation is inhibited, allowing S. flexneri OspI to modulate the diacylglycerolCBM (CARD-BCL10-MALT1) complex-TRAF6-nuclear-factorkB signalling pathway. We determined the 2.0 angstrom crystal structure of OspI, which contains a putative cysteine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad. A mutational analysis showed this catalytic triad to be essential for the deamidation of UBC13. Our results suggest that S. flexneri inhibits acute inflammatory responses in the initial stage of infection by targeting the UBC13-TRAF6 complex.","[Sanada, Takahito; Kim, Minsoo; Sasakawa, Chihiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Infect Dis Control, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Mimuro, Hitomi] Univ Tokyo, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Dept Infect Dis Control, Div Bacteriol,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Suzuki, Masato; Ogawa, Michinaga; Oyama, Akiho; Ashida, Hiroshi; Kobayashi, Taira; Sasakawa, Chihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Bacterial Infect,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Koyama, Tomohiro; Nagai, Shinya; Sasakawa, Chihiro] Nippon Inst Biol Sci, Tokyo 1980024, Japan; [Shibata, Yuri; Gohda, Jin; Inoue, Jun-ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Canc Biol, Div Cellular & Mol Biol,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Mizushima, Tsunehiro] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Life Sci, Picobiol Inst, Akoh, Hyogo 6781297, Japan","Sasakawa, C (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Infect Dis Control, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",mizushi@sci.u-hyogo.ac.jp; sasakawa@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Taira/B-1149-2014; Suzuki, Masato/B-7568-2013","Kobayashi, Taira/0000-0001-7297-8524; Suzuki, Masato/0000-0001-8975-2193",Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases; Naito Foundation; Waksman Foundation of Japan; Yakult Bio-Science Foundation; Yakult Central Institute; Hayashi Memorial Foundation for Female Natural Scientists;  [23121525];  [23000012];  [23689027];  [23790471];  [23790472];  [22790403];  [23390102];  [23659220];  [18073003],"We thank H.

Colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with a microbiota promotes increased vessel density in the small intestine(1), but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Tissue factor (TF) is themembrane receptor that initiates the extrinsic coagulation pathway(2), and it promotes developmental and tumour angiogenesis(3,4). Here we show that the gut microbiota promotes TF glycosylation associated with localization of TF on the cell surface, the activation of coagulation proteases, and phosphorylation of theTFcytoplasmic domain in the small intestine. Anti-TF treatment of colonized GF mice decreased microbiota-induced vascular remodelling and expression of the proangiogenic factor angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the small intestine. Mice with a genetic deletion of theTFcytoplasmic domain or with hypomorphic TF (F3) alleles had a decreased intestinal vessel density. Coagulation proteases downstream of TF activate protease-activated receptor (PAR) signalling implicated in angiogenesis(5). Vesseldensity and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of TF were decreased in small intestine fromPAR1-deficient (F2r(-/-)) but not PAR2-deficient (F2rl1(-/-)) mice, and inhibition of thrombin showed that thrombin-PAR1 signalling was upstream of TF phosphorylation. Thus, the microbiota-induced extravascular TF-PAR1 signalling loop is a novel pathway thatmay bemodulated to influence vascular remodelling in the small intestine.","[Reinhardt, Christoph; Bergentall, Mattias; Greiner, Thomas U.; Ostergren-Lunden, Gunnel; Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Ctr Cardiovasc & Metab Res, Wallenberg Lab, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Reinhardt, Christoph; Bergentall, Mattias; Greiner, Thomas U.; Ostergren-Lunden, Gunnel; Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Mol & Clin Med, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Reinhardt, Christoph] Univ Med Ctr Mainz, CTH, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Schaffner, Florence; Ruf, Wolfram] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Petersen, Lars C.] Novo Nordisk AS, Haemostasis Biol, DK-2760 Malov, Denmark; [Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Sect Metab Receptol & Enteroendocrinol, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Backhed, F (reprint author), Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Ctr Cardiovasc & Metab Res, Wallenberg Lab, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.backhed@wlab.gu.se,,"Backhed, Fredrik/0000-0002-4871-8818","Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Swedish Research Council; Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg's foundation; Petrus and Augusta Hedlund's foundation; Swedish federal government under LUA/ALF; National Institutes of Health [HL-60742, HL-77753]; European Union; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [BMBF 01EO1003]","We thank R.

AR2 expels intracellular protons through the decarboxylation of L-glutamate (Glu) in the cytoplasm and exchange of the reaction product c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with extracellular Glu. The latter process is mediated by the Glu-GABA antiporter GadC(4,5), a representative member of theamino-acid-polyamine-organocation superfamily of membrane transporters. The functional mechanism of GadC remains largely unknown. Here we show, with the use of anin vitro proteoliposome-based assay, that GadC transports GABA/Glu only under acidic conditions, with no detectable activity at pH values higher than 6.5. We determined the crystal structure of E. coli GadC at 3.1 angstrom resolution under basic conditions. GadC, comprising 12 transmembrane segments (TMs), exists in a closed state, with its carboxy-terminal domain serving as a plug to block an otherwise inward-open conformation. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal the essential transport residues, identify the transport path and suggest a conserved transport mechanism involving the rigid-body rotation of a helical bundle for GadC and other amino acid antiporters.","[Ma, Dan; Lu, Peilong; Fan, Chao; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Prot Sci Lab,Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ma, Dan; Lu, Peilong; Yan, Chuangye; Fan, Chao; Yin, Ping; Wang, Jiawei; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yan, Chuangye; Yin, Ping; Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ma, Dan; Lu, Peilong; Yan, Chuangye; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Shi, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Prot Sci Lab,Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shi-lab@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918801]; National Natural Science Foundation; Beijing Municipal Commissions of Education and Science and Technology,"We thank S.

Although thoroughly characterized for spheres larger than ten nanometres in diameter, the plasmonic properties of particles in the quantum size regime have been historically difficult to describe owing to weak optical scattering, metal-ligand interactions, and inhomogeneity in ensemble measurements. Such difficulties have precluded probing and controlling the plasmonic properties of quantum-sized particles in many natural and engineered processes, notably catalysis. Here we investigate the plasmon resonances of individual ligand-free silver nanoparticles using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging and monochromated scanning TEM electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). This technique allows direct correlation between a particle's geometry and its plasmon resonance. As the nanoparticle diameter decreases from 20 nanometres to less than two nanometres, the plasmon resonance shifts to higher energy by 0.5 electronvolts, a substantial deviation from classical predictions. We present an analytical quantum mechanical model that describes this shift due to a change in particle permittivity. Our results highlight the quantum plasmonic properties of small metallic nanospheres, with direct application to understanding and exploiting catalytically active and biologically relevant nanoparticles.","[Scholl, Jonathan A.; Dionne, Jennifer A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Koh, Ai Leen] Stanford Univ, Stanford Nanocharacterizat Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dionne, JA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jscholl@stanford.edu; jdionne@stanford.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Stanford Terman Fellowship; Robert N.

Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza virus affects host cells through the interaction of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with the infected cell epigenome. We show that the NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic) that is used by the virus to target the human PAF1 transcription elongation complex (hPAF1C). We demonstrate that binding of NS1 to hPAF1C depends on the NS1 histone mimic and results in suppression of hPAF1C-mediated transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, human PAF1 has a crucial role in the antiviral response. Loss of hPAF1C binding by NS1 attenuates influenza infection, whereas hPAF1C deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression and renders cells more susceptible to viruses. We propose that the histone mimic in NS1 enables the influenza virus to affect inducible gene expression selectively, thus contributing to suppression of the antiviral response.","[Marazzi, Ivan; Ho, Jessica S.

Eukaryotic Okazaki fragments remain poorly characterized and, because nucleosomes are rapidly deposited on nascent DNA, Okazaki fragment processing and nucleosome assembly potentially affect one another. Here we show that ligation-competent Okazaki fragments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sized according to the nucleosome repeat. Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Our studies represent the first high-resolution analysis-to our knowledge-of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments in vivo, and reveal the interconnection between lagging-strand synthesis and chromatin assembly.","[Smith, Duncan J.; Whitehouse, Iestyn] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Whitehouse, I (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",whitehoi@mskcc.org,,"Smith, Duncan/0000-0002-0898-8629; Whitehouse, Iestyn/0000-0003-0385-3116",Louis V.

Attempts to understand its spectrum are inextricably linked to the early history and development of quantum mechanics. The hydrogen atom's stature lies in its simplicity and in the accuracy with which its spectrum can be measured(1) and compared to theory. Today its spectrum remains a valuable tool for determining the values of fundamental constants and for challenging the limits of modern physics, including the validity of quantum electrodynamics and-by comparison with measurements on its antimatter counterpart, antihydrogen-the validity of CPT (charge conjugation, parity and time reversal) symmetry. Here we report spectroscopy of a pure antimatter atom, demonstrating resonant quantum transitions in antihydrogen. We have manipulated the internal spin state(2,3) of antihydrogen atoms so as to induce magnetic resonance transitions between hyperfine levels of the positronic ground state. We used resonant microwave radiation to flip the spin of the positron in antihydrogen atoms that were magnetically trapped(4-6) in the ALPHA apparatus. The spin flip causes trapped anti-atoms to be ejected from the trap. We look for evidence of resonant interaction by comparing the survival rate of trapped atoms irradiated with microwaves on-resonance to that of atoms subjected to microwaves that are off-resonance. In one variant of the experiment, we detect 23 atoms that survive in 110 trapping attempts with microwaves off-resonance (0.21 per attempt), and only two atoms that survive in 103 attempts with microwaves on-resonance (0.02 per attempt). We also describe the direct detection of the annihilation of antihydrogen atoms ejected by the microwaves.","[Bowe, P. D.; Hangst, J. S.; Rasmussen, C.

With the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial resolution and the image quality in transmission electron microscopy have been significantly improved(4,5) and resolution below 0.5 angstroms has been demonstrated(6). To reveal the three-dimensional (3D) structure of thin samples, electron tomography is the method of choice(7-11), with cubic-nanometre resolution currently achievable(10,11). Discrete tomography has recently been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver nanoparticle two to three nanometres in diameter(12), but this statistical method assumes prior knowledge of the particle's lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit rigidly on that lattice. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a general electron tomography method that achieves atomic-scale resolution without initial assumptions about the sample structure. By combining a novel projection alignment and tomographic reconstruction method with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we have determined the 3D structure of an approximately ten-nanometre gold nanoparticle at 2.4-angstrom resolution. Although we cannot definitively locate all of the atoms inside the nanoparticle, individual atoms are observed in some regions of the particle and several grains are identified in three dimensions. The 3D surface morphology and internal lattice structure revealed are consistent with a distorted icosahedral multiply twinned particle. We anticipate that this general method can be applied not only to determine the 3D structure of nanomaterials at atomic-scale resolution(13-15), but also to improve the spatial resolution and image quality in other tomography fields(7,9,16-20).","[Scott, M.

Such phenomena are at present of great interest(1-5) and physicists have put forward a number of theoretical results that so far lack experimental verification(6-8). In animal behaviour studies, large-scale data collection is now technologically possible, but data are still scarce and arise from observations rather than controlled experiments. Multicellular biological systems, such as bacterial colonies or tissues(9,10), allow more control, but may have many hidden variables and interactions, hindering proper tests of theoretical ideas. However, in systems on the subcellular scale such tests may be possible, particularly in in vitro experiments with only few purified components(11-13). Motility assays, in which protein filaments are driven by molecular motors grafted to a substrate in the presence of ATP, can show collective motion for high densities of motors and attached filaments. This was demonstrated recently for the actomyosin system(14,15), but a complete understanding of the mechanisms at work is still lacking. Here we report experiments in which microtubules are propelled by surface-bound dyneins. In this system it is possible to study the local interaction: we find that colliding microtubules align with each other with high probability. At high densities, this alignment results in self-organization of the microtubules, which are on average 15 mu m long, into vortices with diameters of around 400 mu m. Inside the vortices, the microtubules circulate both clockwise and anticlockwise. On longer timescales, the vortices form a lattice structure. The emergence of these structures, as verified by a mathematical model, is the result of the smooth, reptation-like motion of single microtubules in combination with local interactions (the nematic alignment due to collisions)-there is no need for long-range interactions. Apart from its potential relevance to cortical arrays in plant cells(16,17) and other biological situations, our study provides evidence for the existence of previously unsuspected universality classes of collective motion phenomena.","[Shitaka, Yuji; Oiwa, Kazuhiro] Natl Inst Informat & Communicat Technol, Adv ICT Res Inst, Kobe, Hyogo 6512492, Japan; [Nagai, Ken H.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tanaka, Dan] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Dept Complex Syst Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Kenichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Kenichi] JST, ICORP, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Chate, Hugues] CEA Saclay, Serv Phys Etat Condense, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Oiwa, Kazuhiro] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Life Sci, Harima, Hyogo 6781297, Japan","Oiwa, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Informat & Communicat Technol, Adv ICT Res Inst, Kobe, Hyogo 6512492, Japan.",oiwa@nict.go.jp,"Chate, Hugues/D-2156-2015; Oiwa, Kazuhiro/D-7721-2011","Chate, Hugues/0000-0002-6098-4094; Oiwa, Kazuhiro/0000-0002-1281-113X; Yoshikawa, Kenichi/0000-0002-2751-7136",JSPS [23-1819];  [23840019];  [21340023];  [20244067],"We thank H.

Geochronologic and geomorphic evidence indicates that these features formed during interglacial marine isotope stage (MIS) 11, an unusually long interval of warmth during the ice age(1-4). Previous work has advanced two divergent hypotheses for these shoreline features: first, significant melting of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, in addition to the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Greenland Ice Sheet(1-3); or second, emplacement by a mega-tsunami during MIS 11 (ref. 4, 5). Here we show that the elevations of these features are corrected downwards by similar to 10 metres when we account for post-glacial crustal subsidence of these sites over the course of the anomalously long interglacial. On the basis of this correction, we estimate that eustatic sea level rose to similar to 6-13 m above the present-day value in the second half of MIS 11. This suggests that both the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during the protracted warm period while changes in the volume of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet were relatively minor, thereby resolving the long-standing controversy over the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet during MIS 11.","[Raymo, Maureen E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Mitrovica, Jerry X.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Raymo, ME (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, POB 1000,61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",raymo@ldeo.columbia.edu,,,Harvard University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research;  [NSF-OCE-0825293];  [OCE-1202632],"We thank P.

Prior to that event and for the first two-thirds of their evolutionary history, mammals were mostly confined to roles as generalized, small-bodied, nocturnal insectivores(3), presumably under selection pressures from dinosaurs(4). Release from these pressures, by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, triggered ecological diversification of mammals(1,2). Although recent individual fossil discoveries have shown that some mammalian lineages diversified ecologically during the Mesozoic era(5), comprehensive ecological analyses of mammalian groups crossing the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary are lacking. Such analyses are needed because diversification analyses of living taxa(6,7) allow only indirect inferences of past ecosystems. Here we show that in arguably the most evolutionarily successful clade of Mesozoic mammals, the Multituberculata, an adaptive radiation began at least 20 million years before the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and continued across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Disparity in dental complexity, which relates to the range of diets, rose sharply in step with generic richness and disparity in body size. Moreover, maximum dental complexity and body size demonstrate an adaptive shift towards increased herbivory. This dietary expansion tracked the ecological rise of angiosperms(8) and suggests that the resources that were available to multituberculates were relatively unaffected by the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Taken together, our results indicate that mammals were able to take advantage of new ecological opportunities in the Mesozoic and that at least some of these opportunities persisted through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Similar broad-scale ecomorphological inventories of other radiations may help to constrain the possible causes of mass extinctions(9,10).","[Wilson, Gregory P.; Smits, Peter D.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Evans, Alistair R.; Smits, Peter D.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Corfe, Ian J.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fortelius, Mikael] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Wilson, GP (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gpwilson@u.washington.edu,"Wilson, Gregory/A-2363-2009; Evans, Alistair/D-4239-2011","Evans, Alistair/0000-0002-4078-4693; Smits, Peter D/0000-0003-4074-1447; Corfe, Ian/0000-0002-1824-755X; Fortelius, Mikael/0000-0002-4851-783X",National Science Foundation; Denver Museum; University of Washington; Australian Research Council; Monash University; Academy of Finland; EU SYNTHESYS [GB-TAF-4779],"We thank museums, institutions and individuals that made specimens available for this study (full list is available in Supplementary Information).

For example, many hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are harmless (Batesian(1)) mimics of stinging Hymenoptera(2). However, although some hoverfly species are considered excellent mimics, other species bear only a superficial resemblance to their models(3) and it is unclear why this is so. To evaluate hypotheses that have been put forward to explain interspecific variation in the mimetic fidelity of Palearctic Syrphidae we use a comparative approach. We show that the most plausible explanation is that predators impose less selection for mimetic fidelity on smaller hoverfly species because they are less profitable prey items. In particular, our findings, in combination with previous results, allow us to reject several key hypotheses for imperfect mimicry: first, human ratings of mimetic fidelity are positively correlated with both morphometric measures and avian rankings, indicating that variation in mimetic fidelity is not simply an illusion based on human perception(4); second, no species of syrphid maps out in multidimensional space as being intermediate in appearance between several different hymenopteran model species, as the multimodel hypothesis(5) requires; and third, we find no evidence for a negative relationship between mimetic fidelity and abundance, which calls into question the kin-selection(6) hypothesis. By contrast, a strong positive relationship between mimetic fidelity and body size supports the relaxed-selection hypothesis(7,8), suggesting that reduced predation pressure on less profitable prey species limits the selection for mimetic perfection.","[Penney, Heather D.; Hassall, Christopher; Skevington, Jeffrey H.; Abbott, Kevin R.; Sherratt, Thomas N.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Skevington, Jeffrey H.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Canadian Natl Collect Insects Arachnids & Nematod, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada","Sherratt, TN (reprint author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",sherratt@connect.carleton.ca,"Hassall, Christopher/H-2469-2013","Hassall, Christopher/0000-0002-3510-0728; Abbott, Kevin/0000-0003-0682-2024",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Innovation Trust; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding; NSERC Canpolin; Ontario MRI,"We thank W.

In the retina, neurons of numerous individual subtypes form regular arrays called mosaics: they are less likely to be near neighbours of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in 'exclusion zones' that separate them(1-4). Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements(2). Remarkably, mosaics are independent of each other: although a neuron of one subtype is unlikely to be adjacent to another of the same subtype, there is no restriction on its spatial relationship to neighbouring neurons of other subtypes(5). This independence has led to the hypothesis that molecular cues expressed by specific subtypes pattern mosaics by mediating homotypic (within-subtype) short-range repulsive interactions(1,4-9). So far, however, no molecules have been identified that show such activity, so this hypothesis remains untested. Here we demonstrate in mouse that two related transmembrane proteins, MEGF10 and MEGF11, have critical roles in the formation of mosaics by two retinal interneuron subtypes, starburst amacrine cells and horizontal cells. MEGF10 and 11 and their invertebrate relatives Caenorhabditis elegans CED-1 and Drosophila Draper have hitherto been studied primarily as receptors necessary for engulfment of debris following apoptosis or axonal injury(10-14). Our results demonstrate that members of this gene family can also serve as subtype-specific ligands that pattern neuronal arrays.","[Kay, Jeremy N.; Chu, Monica W.; Sanes, Joshua R.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kay, Jeremy N.; Chu, Monica W.; Sanes, Joshua R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Sanes, JR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, 52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sanesj@mcb.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [NS029169, EY022073]; Life Sciences Research Foundation","We thank B.

Reprogramming involves both the resetting of epigenetic marks and the activation of pluripotent-cell-specific genes such as Nanog and Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1)(1-4). The tight regulation of these genes is crucial for reprogramming, but the mechanisms that regulate their expression in vivo have not been uncovered. Here we show that Nanog-but not Oct4-is monoallelically expressed in early pre-implantation embryos. Nanog then undergoes a progressive switch to biallelic expression during the transition towards ground-state pluripotency in the naive epiblast of the late blastocyst. Embryonic stem (ES) cells grown in leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum express Nanog mainly monoallelically and show asynchronous replication of the Nanog locus, a feature of monoallelically expressed genes(5), but ES cells activate both alleles when cultured under 2i conditions, which mimic the pluripotent ground state in vitro. Live-cell imaging with reporter ES cells confirmed the allelic expression of Nanog and revealed allelic switching. The allelic expression of Nanog is regulated through the fibroblast growth factor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling pathway, and it is accompanied by chromatin changes at the proximal promoter but occurs independently of DNA methylation. Nanog-heterozygous blastocysts have fewer inner-cell-mass derivatives and delayed primitive endoderm formation, indicating a role for the biallelic expression of Nanog in the timely maturation of the inner cell mass into a fully reprogrammed pluripotent epiblast. We suggest that the tight regulation of Nanog dose at the chromosome level is necessary for the acquisition of ground-state pluripotency during development. Our data highlight an unexpected role for allelic expression in controlling the dose of pluripotency factors in vivo, adding an extra level to the regulation of reprogramming.","[Miyanari, Yusuke; Torres-Padilla, Maria-Elena] Univ Strasbourg, Cite Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire,INSERM,U964, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Torres-Padilla, ME (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, Cite Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire,INSERM,U964, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",metp@igbmc.fr,,,AVENIR/INSERM; Epigenesys NoE; FRM Alsace; EMBO [ALTF864-2008]; JSPS;  [ANR-09-Blanc-0114],"We thank M.

Here we report that 2HG-producing IDH mutants can prevent the histone demethylation that is required for lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In tumour samples from glioma patients, IDH mutations were associated with a distinct gene expression profile enriched for genes expressed in neural progenitor cells, and this was associated with increased histone methylation. To test whether the ability of IDH mutants to promote histone methylation contributes to a block in cell differentiation in non-transformed cells, we tested the effect of neomorphic IDH mutants on adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Introduction of either mutant IDH or cell-permeable 2HG was associated with repression of the inducible expression of lineage-specific differentiation genes and a block to differentiation. This correlated with a significant increase in repressive histone methylation marks without observable changes in promoter DNA methylation. Gliomas were found to have elevated levels of similar histone repressive marks. Stable transfection of a 2HG-producing mutant IDH into immortalized astrocytes resulted in progressive accumulation of histone methylation. Of the marks examined, increased H3K9 methylation reproducibly preceded a rise in DNA methylation as cells were passaged in culture. Furthermore, we found that the 2HG-inhibitable H3K9 demethylase KDM4C was induced during adipocyte differentiation, and that RNA-interference suppression of KDM4C was sufficient to block differentiation. Together these data demonstrate that 2HG can inhibit histone demethylation and that inhibition of histone demethylation can be sufficient to block the differentiation of non-transformed cells.","[Lu, Chao; Ward, Patrick S.; Thompson, Craig B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lu, Chao; Ward, Patrick S.; Wellen, Kathryn E.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kapoor, Gurpreet S.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rohle, Dan; Turcan, Sevin; Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Chan, Timothy A.; Levine, Ross L.; Mellinghoff, Ingo K.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rohle, Dan; Mellinghoff, Ingo K.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Leukemia Serv, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Edwards, Christopher R.; Berger, Shelley L.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Figueroa, Maria E.; Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Div Hematol Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [O'Rourke, Donald M.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mellinghoff, Ingo K.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Thompson, CB (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",thompsonc@mskcc.org,"Lu, Chao/E-8047-2012","Ward, Patrick/0000-0001-6437-8174; Turcan, Sevin/0000-0002-0885-5607; Abdel-Wahab, Omar/0000-0002-3907-6171; O'Rourke, Donald/0000-0002-8479-7314",National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; MSKCC; Abramson Cancer Center at University of Pennsylvania; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; American Society of Clinical Oncology;  [NCI-U54CA143798],"We thank members of the Thompson laboratory for technical help and critical reading of the manuscript.

Glioblastomas and other cancers with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) constitute a subset of tumours with extensive epigenomic aberrations and a distinct biology(1-3). Glioma CIMP (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumour pathogenicity, but the molecular basis of G-CIMP remains unresolved. Here we show that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), establishes G-CIMP by remodelling the methylome. This remodelling results in reorganization of the methylome and transcriptome. Examination of the epigenome of a large set of intermediate-grade gliomas demonstrates a distinct G-CIMP phenotype that is highly dependent on the presence of IDH mutation. Introduction of mutant IDH1 into primary human astrocytes alters specific histone marks, induces extensive DNA hypermethylation, and reshapes the methylome in a fashion that mirrors the changes observed in G-CIMP-positive lower-grade gliomas. Furthermore, the epigenomic alterations resulting from mutant IDH1 activate key gene expression programs, characterize G-CIMP-positive proneural glioblastomas but not other glioblastomas, and are predictive of improved survival. Our findings demonstrate that IDH mutation is the molecular basis of CIMP in gliomas, provide a framework for understanding oncogenesis in these gliomas, and highlight the interplay between genomic and epigenomic changes in human cancers.","[Turcan, Sevin; Rohle, Daniel; Goenka, Anuj; Walsh, Logan A.; Fang, Fang; Yilmaz, Emrullah; Campos, Carl; Fabius, Armida W.

Inactivating SDH and FH mutations cause the accumulation of succinate and fumarate, respectively, which can inhibit 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent enzymes, including the EGLN prolyl 4-hydroxylases that mark the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation(1). Inappropriate HIF activation is suspected of contributing to the pathogenesis of SDH-defective and FH-defective tumours but can suppress tumour growth in some other contexts. IDH1 and IDH2, which catalyse the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-OG, are frequently mutated in human brain tumours and leukaemias. The resulting mutants have the neomorphic ability to convert 2-OG to the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate ((R)-2HG)(2,3). Here we show that (R)-2HG, but not (S)-2HG, stimulates EGLN activity, leading to diminished HIF levels, which enhances the proliferation and soft agar growth of human astrocytes. These findings define an enantiomer-specific mechanism by which the (R)-2HG that accumulates in IDH mutant brain tumours promotes transformation and provide a justification for exploring EGLN inhibition as a potential treatment strategy.","[Lee, Sungwoo; Lu, Gang; Ramkissoon, Shakti; Losman, Julie A.; Ligon, Keith L.; Kaelin, William G., Jr.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lee, Sungwoo; Lu, Gang; Ramkissoon, Shakti; Losman, Julie A.; Ligon, Keith L.; Kaelin, William G., Jr.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Koivunen, Peppi] Univ Oulu, Oulu Ctr Cell Matrix Res, Dept Med Biochem & Mol Biol, Bioctr Oulu, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Duncan, Christopher G.; Lopez, Giselle; Yan, Hai] Pediat Brain Tumor Fdn Inst, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Ctr Duke, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Duncan, Christopher G.; Lopez, Giselle; Yan, Hai] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Ramkissoon, Shakti; Ligon, Keith L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ramkissoon, Shakti; Ligon, Keith L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Joensuu, Paivi] Univ Oulu, Dept Chem, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Bergmann, Ulrich] Univ Oulu, Dept Biochem, Mass Spectrometry Core Facil, Bioctr Oulu, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Gross, Stefan; Travins, Jeremy] Agios Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Weiss, Samuel] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Dept Cell Biol, Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Weiss, Samuel] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Dept Anat, Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Looper, Ryan] Univ Utah, Dept Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Ligon, Keith L.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Verhaak, Roel G.

Transport of nucleosides across cell membranes provides the major source of nucleosides in many cell types and is also responsible for the termination of adenosine signalling. As a result of their hydrophilic nature, nucleosides require a specialized class of integral membrane proteins, known as nucleoside transporters (NTs), for specific transport across cell membranes. In addition to nucleosides, NTs are important determinants for the transport of nucleoside-derived drugs across cell membranes(3-5). A wide range of nucleoside-derived drugs, including anticancer drugs (such as Ara-C and gemcitabine) and antiviral drugs (such as zidovudine and ribavirin), have been shown to depend, at least in part, on NTs for transport across cell membranes(4,6-13). Concentrative nucleoside transporters, members of the solute carrier transporter superfamily SLC28, use an ion gradient in the active transport of both nucleosides and nucleoside-derived drugs against their chemical gradients. The structural basis for selective ion-coupled nucleoside transport by concentrative nucleoside transporters is unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of a concentrative nucleoside transporter from Vibrio cholerae in complex with uridine at 2.4 angstrom. Our functional data show that, like its human orthologues, the transporter uses a sodium-ion gradient for nucleoside transport. The structure reveals the overall architecture of this class of transporter, unravels the molecular determinants for nucleoside and sodium binding, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of nucleoside and nucleoside drug transport across cell membranes.","[Johnson, Zachary Lee; Cheong, Cheom-Gil; Lee, Seok-Yong] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Johnson, Zachary Lee; Cheong, Cheom-Gil; Lee, Seok-Yong] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ion Channel Res Unit, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Lee, SY (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem, 2 Genome Court, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",sylee@biochem.duke.edu,"perumal, murugiah/D-1565-2012",,Duke University Medical Center; McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience; Alfred P.

As a major metabolite in anaerobic bacterial growth, hydrogen sulphide is a product of both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulphate reduction(2-4). These pathways can reduce various oxidized sulphur compounds including sulphate, sulphite and thiosulphate. The dissimilatory sulphate reduction pathway uses this molecule as the terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration, in which process it produces excess amounts of H2S (ref. 4). The reduction of sulphite is a key intermediate step in all sulphate reduction pathways. In Clostridium and Salmonella, an inducible sulphite reductase is directly linked to the regeneration of NAD(+), which has been suggested to have a role in energy production and growth, as well as in the detoxification of sulphite(3). Above a certain concentration threshold, both H2S and HS- inhibit cell growth by binding the metal centres of enzymes and cytochrome oxidase(5), necessitating a release mechanism for the export of this toxic metabolite from the cell(5-9). Here we report the identification of a hydrosulphide ion channel in the pathogen Clostridium difficile through a combination of genetic, biochemical and functional approaches. The HS- channel is a member of the formate/nitrite transport family, in which about 50 hydrosulphide ion channels form a third subfamily alongside those for formate(10,11) (FocA) and for nitrite(12) (NirC). The hydrosulphide ion channel is permeable to formate and nitrite as well as to HS- ions. Such polyspecificity can be explained by the conserved ion selectivity filter observed in the channel's crystal structure. The channel has a low open probability and is tightly regulated, to avoid decoupling of the membrane proton gradient.","[Czyzewski, Bryan K.; Wang, Da-Neng] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Czyzewski, Bryan K.] NYU, Sch Med, Mol Biophys Grad Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wang, Da-Neng] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Wang, DN (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, 540 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",wang@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,,"NIH [R01-GM093825, R01-DK073973, R01-MH083840, U54-GM075026, R01-DK053973-08A1S1, F31-AI086072]","We are grateful the staff at beamlines X25 and X29 of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at beamline 23ID of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory for assistance in X-ray diffraction experiments.

This has led to the idea that signalling-centre genetic programs were first assembled in stem vertebrates and potentially drove morphological innovations of the brain. However, this scenario presumes that extant cephalochordates accurately represent ancestral chordate characters, which has not been tested using close chordate outgroups. Here we report that genetic programs homologous to three vertebrate signalling centres-the anterior neural ridge, zona limitans intrathalamica and isthmic organizer-are present in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Fgf8/17/18 (a single gene homologous to vertebrate Fgf8, Fgf17 and Fgf18), sfrp1/5, hh and wnt1 are expressed in vertebrate-like arrangements in hemichordate ectoderm, and homologous genetic mechanisms regulate ectodermal patterning in both animals. We propose that these genetic programs were components of an unexpectedly complex, ancient genetic regulatory scaffold for deuterostome body patterning that degenerated in amphioxus and ascidians, but was retained to pattern divergent structures in hemichordates and vertebrates.","[Pani, Ariel M.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolut Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pani, Ariel M.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Mullarkey, Erin E.; Grove, Elizabeth A.] Univ Chicago, Comm Neurobiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Aronowicz, Jochanan; Grove, Elizabeth A.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Assimacopoulos, Stavroula; Grove, Elizabeth A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Lowe, CJ (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolut Biol, 1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",clowe@stanford.edu,,"Lowe, Christopher/0000-0002-7789-8643",Searle Kinship Foundation; Brain Research Foundation; National Science Foundation [1049106]; National Institutes of Health [R01 HD42330]; University of Chicago; Marine Biological Laboratory Frank R.

Their structural and positional organization across eukaryotic genomes is unknown. Here we applied lambda exonuclease to chromatin immunoprecipitates (termed ChIP-exo) to examine the precise location of 6,045 PICs in Saccharomyces. PICs, including RNA polymerase II and protein complexes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (or TBP), TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIK were positioned within promoters and excluded from coding regions. Exonuclease patterns were in agreement with crystallographic models of the PIC, and were sufficiently precise to identify TATA-like elements at so-called TATA-less promoters. These PICs and their transcription start sites were positionally constrained at TFIID-engaged downstream +1 nucleosomes. At TATA-box-containing promoters, which are depleted of TFIID, a 11 nucleosome was positioned to be in competition with the PIC, which may allow greater latitude in start-site selection. Our genomic localization of messenger RNA and non-coding RNA PICs reveals that two PICs, in inverted orientation, may occupy the flanking borders of nucleosome-free regions.

At a Dirac point, two energy bands intersect linearly and the electrons behave as relativistic Dirac fermions. In solids, the rigid structure of the material determines the mass and velocity of the electrons, as well as their interactions. A different, highly flexible means of studying condensed-matter phenomena is to create model systems using ultracold atoms trapped in the periodic potential of interfering laser beams(3,4). Here we report the creation of Dirac points with adjustable properties in a tunable honeycomb optical lattice. Using momentum-resolved interband transitions, we observe a minimum bandgap inside the Brillouin zone at the positions of the two Dirac points. We exploit the unique tunability of our lattice potential to adjust the effective mass of the Dirac fermions by breaking inversion symmetry. Moreover, changing the lattice anisotropy allows us to change the positions of the Dirac points inside the Brillouin zone. When the anisotropy exceeds a critical limit, the two Dirac points merge and annihilate each other-a situation that has recently attracted considerable theoretical interest(5-9) but that is extremely challenging to observe in solids(10). We map out this topological transition in lattice parameter space and find excellent agreement with ab initio calculations. Our results not only pave the way to model materials in which the topology of the band structure is crucial, but also provide an avenue to exploring many-body phases resulting from the interplay of complex lattice geometries with interactions(11-13).","[Tarruell, Leticia; Greif, Daniel; Uehlinger, Thomas; Jotzu, Gregor; Esslinger, Tilman] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Esslinger, T (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",esslinger@phys.ethz.ch,"Tarruell, Leticia/I-8152-2012; Esslinger, Tilman/M-9022-2016; Greif, Daniel/M-4480-2017","Tarruell, Leticia/0000-0002-0564-1435; Esslinger, Tilman/0000-0002-8333-107X; Greif, Daniel/0000-0002-0721-7726; Jotzu, Gregor/0000-0003-4421-5874","SNF; NCCR-MaNEP; NCCR-QSIT; NAME-QUAM (EU, FET open); SQMS; ESF (POLATOM)","We would like to thank D.

Both massless and massive Dirac fermions have been studied and proposed in a growing class of Dirac materials that includes bilayer graphene, surface states of topological insulators and iron-based high-temperature superconductors. Because the accessibility of this physics is predicated on the synthesis of new materials, the quest for Dirac quasi-particles has expanded to artificial systems such as lattices comprising ultracold atoms(2-4). Here we report the emergence of Dirac fermions in a fully tunable condensed-matter system-molecular graphene-assembled by atomic manipulation of carbon monoxide molecules over a conventional two-dimensional electron system at a copper surface(5). Using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we embed the symmetries underlying the two-dimensional Dirac equation into electron lattices, and then visualize and shape the resulting ground states. These experiments show the existence within the system of linearly dispersing, massless quasi-particles accompanied by a density of states characteristic of graphene. We then tune the quantum tunnelling between lattice sites locally to adjust the phase accrual of propagating electrons. Spatial texturing of lattice distortions produces atomically sharp p-n and p-n-p junction devices with two-dimensional control of Dirac fermion density and the power to endow Dirac particles with mass(6-8). Moreover, we apply scalar and vector potentials locally and globally to engender topologically distinct ground states and, ultimately, embedded gauge fields(9-12), wherein Dirac electrons react to 'pseudo' electric and magnetic fields present in their reference frame but absent from the laboratory frame. We demonstrate that Landau levels created by these gauge fields can be taken to the relativistic magnetic quantum limit, which has so far been inaccessible in natural graphene. Molecular graphene provides a versatile means of synthesizing exotic topological electronic phases in condensed matter using tailored nanostructures.","[Gomes, Kenjiro K.; Manoharan, Hari C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gomes, Kenjiro K.; Mar, Warren; Ko, Wonhee; Manoharan, Hari C.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Mar, Warren] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ko, Wonhee] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Guinea, Francisco] CSIC, Inst Ciencia Mat Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Manoharan, HC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",manoharan@stanford.edu,"Guinea, Francisco/A-7122-2008","Guinea, Francisco/0000-0001-5915-5427; Ko, Wonhee/0000-0002-6155-1485","US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering [DE-AC02-76SF00515]; MICINN (Spain) [FIS2008-00124, CSD2007-00010]; US National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, under contract DE-AC02-76SF00515.

Particularly promising components for such materials are metal nanostructures, where structural alterations provide a straightforward means of tailoring their surface plasmon resonances and hence their interaction with light(2,3). But the top-down fabrication of plasmonic materials with controlled optical responses in the visible spectral range remains challenging, because lithographic methods are limited in resolution and in their ability to generate genuinely three-dimensional architectures(4,5). Molecular self-assembly(6,7) provides an alternative bottom-up fabrication route not restricted by these limitations, and DNA-and peptide-directed assembly have proved to be viable methods for the controlled arrangement of metal nanoparticles in complex and also chiral geometries(8-14). Here we show that DNA origami(15,16) enables the high-yield production of plasmonic structures that contain nanoparticles arranged in nanometre-scale helices. We find, in agreement with theoretical predictions(17), that the structures in solution exhibit defined circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion effects at visible wavelengths that originate from the collective plasmon-plasmon interactions of the nanoparticles positioned with an accuracy better than two nanometres. Circular dichroism effects in the visible part of the spectrum have been achieved by exploiting the chiral morphology of organic molecules and the plasmonic properties of nanoparticles(18-20), or even without precise control over the spatial configuration of the nanoparticles(12,21,22). In contrast, the optical response of our nanoparticle assemblies is rationally designed and tunable in handedness, colour and intensity-in accordance with our theoretical model.","[Schreiber, Robert; Roller, Eva-Maria; Hoegele, Alexander; Liedl, Tim] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Schreiber, Robert; Roller, Eva-Maria; Hoegele, Alexander; Liedl, Tim] Univ Munich, Ctr Nanosci, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Kuzyk, Anton; Pardatscher, Guenther; Simmel, Friedrich C.] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Kuzyk, Anton; Pardatscher, Guenther; Simmel, Friedrich C.] Tech Univ Munich, ZNN WSI, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Fan, Zhiyuan; Govorov, Alexander O.] Ohio Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Athens, OH 45701 USA","Liedl, T (reprint author), Univ Munich, Fak Phys, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",tim.liedl@lmu.de,"Simmel, Friedrich/G-3281-2010; Kuzyk, Anton/D-7317-2011; Liedl, Tim/O-7539-2014; Fan, Zhiyuan/C-2504-2015; Hogele, Alexander/C-1080-2016","Simmel, Friedrich/0000-0003-3829-3446; Kuzyk, Anton/0000-0001-8060-6122; Liedl, Tim/0000-0002-0040-0173; Fan, Zhiyuan/0000-0002-9312-2271; Hogele, Alexander/0000-0002-0178-9117",Volkswagen Foundation; DFG Cluster of Excellence NIM (Nanosystems Initiative Munich); NSF (USA),"We thank H.

Neoproterozoic carbonate records contain unusual and large negative isotopic anomalies within long periods (10-100 million years) characterized by delta C-13 in carbonate (delta C-13(carb)) enriched to more than 15 per mil. Classically, delta C-13(carb) is interpreted as a metric of the relative fraction of carbon buried as organic matter in marine sediments(2-4), which can be linked to oxygen accumulation through the stoichiometry of primary production(3,5). If a change in the isotopic composition of marine dissolved inorganic carbon is responsible for these excursions, it is expected that records of delta C-13(carb) and delta C-13 in organic carbon (delta C-13(org)) will covary, offset by the fractionation imparted by primary production(5). The documentation of several Neoproterozoic delta C-13(carb) excursions that are decoupled from delta C-13(org), however, indicates that other mechanisms(6-8) may account for these excursions. Here we present delta C-13 data from Mongolia, northwest Canada and Namibia that capture multiple large-amplitude (over 10 per mil) negative carbon isotope anomalies, and use these data in a new quantitative mixing model to examine the behaviour of the Neoproterozoic carbon cycle. We find that carbonate and organic carbon isotope data from Mongolia and Canada are tightly coupled through multiple delta C-13(carb) excursions, quantitatively ruling out previously suggested alternative explanations, such as diagenesis(7,8) or the presence and terminal oxidation of a large marine dissolved organic carbon reservoir(6). Our data from Namibia, which do not record isotopic covariance, can be explained by simple mixing with a detrital flux of organic matter. We thus interpret delta C-13(carb) anomalies as recording a primary perturbation to the surface carbon cycle. This interpretation requires the revisiting of models linking drastic isotope excursions to deep ocean oxygenation and the opening of environments capable of supporting animals(9-11).","[Johnston, D.

In contrast, experimental studies of development more readily show a decrease in complexity, again well exemplified by mammalian teeth, in which tooth crown features called cusps are frequently lost in mutant and transgenic mice(5-7). Here we report that mouse tooth complexity can be increased substantially by adjusting multiple signalling pathways simultaneously. We cultured teeth in vitro and adjusted ectodysplasin (EDA), activin A and sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways, all of which are individually required for normal tooth development. We quantified tooth complexity using the number of cusps and a topographic measure of surface complexity(8). The results show that whereas activation of EDA and activin A signalling, and inhibition of SHH signalling, individually cause subtle to moderate increases in complexity, cusp number is doubled when all three pathways are adjusted in unison. Furthermore, the increase in cusp number does not result from an increase in tooth size, but from an altered primary patterning phase of development. The combination of a lack of complex mutants(5-7), the paucity of natural variants with complex phenotypes(9), and our results of greatly increased dental complexity using multiple pathways, suggests that an increase may be inherently different from a decrease in phenotypic complexity.","[Harjunmaa, Enni; Voutilainen, Maria; Mikkola, Marja L.; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Dev Biol Program, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kallonen, Aki; Hamalainen, Keijo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Div Mat Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Jernvall, J (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dev Biol Program, Inst Biotechnol, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",jernvall@fastmail.fm,"Hamalainen, Keijo/A-3986-2010","Hamalainen, Keijo/0000-0002-9234-9810",Academy of Finland; Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation; graduate school GSBM,"We thank I.

Because parasites and pathogens tend to have shorter generation times(1,2) and often experience stronger selection due to interaction than their victims do(3,4), it is frequently argued that they should evolve more rapidly and thus maintain an advantage in the evolutionary race between defence and counter-defence(1,5). This prediction generates an apparent paradox: how do victim species survive and even thrive in the face of a continuous onslaught of more rapidly evolving enemies(5)? One potential explanation is that defence is physiologically, mechanically or behaviourally easier than attack, so that evolution is less constrained for victims than for parasites or pathogens(6). Another possible explanation is that parasites and pathogens have enemies themselves and that victim species persist because parasites and pathogens are regulated from the top down and thus generally have only modest demographic impacts on victimpopulations(7,8). Here we explore a third possibility: that victim species are not as evolutionarily impotent as conventional wisdom holds, but instead have unique evolutionary advantages that help to level the playing field. We use quantitative genetic analysis and individual-based simulations to show that victims can achieve such an advantage when coevolution involves multiple traits in both the host and the parasite.","[Gilman, R.

Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills(2-4), it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning.","[Jin, Xin; Costa, Rui M.] NIAAA, Lab Integrat Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Koralek, Aaron C.; Ii, John D.

However, the mechanisms by which angstrom-scale molecular properties are translated to micrometre-scale macroscopic properties are not well understood. Here we show that interactions between diverse synthetic, multivalent macromolecules (including multi-domain proteins and RNA) produce sharp liquid-liquid demixing phase separations, generating micrometre-sized liquid droplets in aqueous solution. This macroscopic transition corresponds to a molecular transition between small complexes and large, dynamic supramolecular polymers. The concentrations needed for phase transition are directly related to the valency of the interacting species. In the case of the actin-regulatory protein called neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) interacting with its established biological partners NCK and phosphorylated nephrin(1), the phase transition corresponds to a sharp increase in activity towards an actin nucleation factor, the Arp2/3 complex. The transition is governed by the degree of phosphorylation of nephrin, explaining how this property of the system can be controlled to regulatory effect by kinases. The widespread occurrence of multivalent systems suggests that phase transitions may be used to spatially organize and biochemically regulate information throughout biology.","[Li, Pilong; Banjade, Sudeep; Cheng, Hui-Chun; Kim, Soyeon; Chen, Baoyu; Banani, Salman F.; Rosen, Michael K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Li, Pilong; Banjade, Sudeep; Cheng, Hui-Chun; Kim, Soyeon; Chen, Baoyu; Banani, Salman F.; Rosen, Michael K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Guo, Liang] Argonne Natl Lab, BioCAT IIT Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Llaguno, Marc; Jiang, Qiu-Xing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Hollingsworth, Javoris V.; Russo, Paul S.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Chem, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hollingsworth, Javoris V.; Russo, Paul S.] Louisiana State Univ, Macromol Studies Grp, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [King, David S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mass Spectrometry Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [King, David S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nixon, B.

They are mostly exuded from roots and function as signalling compounds in the initiation of arbuscular mycorrhizae(3), which are plant-fungus symbionts with a global effect on carbon and phosphate cycling(4). Recently, strigolactones were established to be phytohormones that regulate plant shoot architecture by inhibiting the outgrowth of axillary buds(5,6). Despite their importance, it is not known how strigolactones are transported. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, however, are known to have functions in phytohormone translocation(7-9). Here we show that the Petunia hybrida ABC transporter PDR1 has a key role in regulating the development of arbuscular mycorrhizae and axillary branches, by functioning as a cellular strigolactone exporter. P. hybrida pdr1 mutants are defective in strigolactone exudation from their roots, resulting in reduced symbiotic interactions. Above ground, pdr1 mutants have an enhanced branching phenotype, which is indicative of impaired strigolactone allocation. Overexpression of Petunia axillaris PDR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana results in increased tolerance to high concentrations of a synthetic strigolactone, consistent with increased export of strigolactones from the roots. PDR1 is the first known component in strigolactone transport, providing new opportunities for investigating and manipulating strigolactone-dependent processes.","[Kretzschmar, Tobias; Sasse, Joelle; Borghi, Lorenzo; Schlegel, Markus; Bachelier, Julien B.; Martinoia, Enrico] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kohlen, Wouter; Bours, Ralph; Bouwmeester, Harro J.] Wageningen Univ, Lab Plant Physiol, NL-6700 AR Wageningen, Netherlands; [Reinhardt, Didier] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Bouwmeester, Harro J.] Ctr Biosyst Genom, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands","Kretzschmar, T (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Zollikerstr 107, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",t.kretzschmar@irri.org,"Kretzschmar, Tobias/M-5930-2013; Reinhardt, Didier/M-8508-2014","Reinhardt, Didier/0000-0003-3495-6783; Bouwmeester, Harro/0000-0003-0907-2732; Schlapfer, Joelle/0000-0001-5705-9888","Swiss National Foundation within the NCCR; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [865.06.002, 834.08.001]; Centre for BioSystems Genomics (CBSG)","We kindly thank the following: C.

Understanding how pathogen-specific immunity is elicited while avoiding inappropriate responses to the background of innocuous antigens is essential for understanding and treating intestinal infections and inflammatory diseases. The ingestion of protein antigen can induce oral tolerance, which is mediated in part by a subset of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) that promote the development of regulatory T cells(1). The lamina propria (LP) underlies the expansive single-cell absorptive villous epithelium and contains a large population of DCs (CD11c(+) CD11b(+) MHCII+ cells) comprised of two predominant subsets: CD103(+) CX(3)CR1(-) DCs, which promote IgA production, imprint gut homing on lymphocytes and induce the development of regulatory T cells(2-9), and CD103(-) CX(3)CR1(+) DCs (with features of macrophages), which promote tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production, colitis, and the development of T(H)17 T cells(5-7,10). However, the mechanisms by which different intestinal LP-DC subsets capture luminal antigens in vivo remains largely unexplored. Using a minimally disruptive in vivo imaging approach we show that in the steady state, small intestine goblet cells (GCs) function as passages delivering low molecular weight soluble antigens from the intestinal lumen to underlying CD103(+) LP-DCs. The preferential delivery of antigens to DCs with tolerogenic properties implies a key role for this GC function in intestinal immune homeostasis.","[McDole, Jeremiah R.; Wang, Baomei; Miller, Mark J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Wheeler, Leroy W.; McDonald, Keely G.; Knoop, Kathryn A.; Newberry, Rodney D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Konjufca, Vjollca] So Illinois Univ, Dept Microbiol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Miller, MJ (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",rnewberry@wustl.edu; miller@pathology.wustl.edu,,"Konjufca, Vjollca/0000-0002-7736-5097; Knoop, Kathryn/0000-0003-2007-3066; Newberry, Rodney/0000-0002-4152-5191",NCI Cancer Center [P30 CA91842];  [DK064798];  [AI083538];  [AI095550];  [DK085941];  [AI077600];  [P30-DK52574],"This work was supported in part by grants DK064798 (R.D.N.), AI083538 (R.D.N.), AI095550 (R.D.N. and M.J.M.), DK085941 (L.W.W.) and AI077600 (M.J.M.).

Several G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as free-fatty-acid receptors important in physiology as well as in several diseases(3,5-13). GPR120 (also known as O3FAR1) functions as a receptor for unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids and has a critical role in various physiological homeostasis mechanisms such as adipogenesis, regulation of appetite and food preference(5,6,14-16). Here we show that GPR120-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet develop obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic lipogenesis. Insulin resistance in such mice is associated with reduced insulin signalling and enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue. In human, we show that GPR120 expression in adipose tissue is significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean controls. GPR120 exon sequencing in obese subjects reveals a deleterious non-synonymous mutation (p.R270H) that inhibits GPR120 signalling activity. Furthermore, the p.R270H variant increases the risk of obesity in European populations. Overall, this study demonstrates that the lipid sensor GPR120 has a key role in sensing dietary fat and, therefore, in the control of energy balance in both humans and rodents.","[Poulain-Godefroy, Odile; Bonnefond, Amelie; Yengo, Loic; Leloire, Audrey; Choquet, Helene; Lecoeur, Cecile; Vivequin, Sidonie; Morandi, Anita; Rouskas, Konstantinos; Meyre, David; Wolowczuk, Isabelle; Froguel, Philippe] Lille Pasteur Inst, CNRS, UMR 8199, F-59000 Lille, France; [Ichimura, Atsuhiko; Hirasawa, Akira; Hara, Takafumi; Kimura, Ikuo; Liu, Ning; Iida, Keiko; Ayukawa, Kumiko; Takeuchi, Masato; Ozawa, Kentaro; Tsujimoto, Gozoh] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Genom Drug Discovery Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Pigeyre, Marie; Caiazzo, Roberto; Pattou, Francois] Lille Nord France Univ, INSERM, U859, F-59000 Lille, France; [Besnard, Philippe] Univ Bourgogne, INSERM, UMR U866, AgroSup Dijon, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Tauber, Maithe] Ctr Hosp Univ, Childrens Hosp, INSERM, U563, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Maffeis, Claudio; Morandi, Anita] Reg Ctr Juvenile Diabet Obes & Clin Nutr, I-37134 Verona, Italy; [Maffeis, Claudio] Univ Verona, Dept Mother & Child, Paediat Sect, I-37134 Verona, Italy; [Buzzetti, Raffaella] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Clin Sci, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Elliott, Paul; Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, HPA Ctr Environm & Hlth,MRC, London W2 1PG, England; [Pouta, Anneli; Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Univ Oulu, Natl Publ Hlth Inst, Bioctr Oulu, SF-90220 Oulu, Finland; [Pouta, Anneli] Univ Oulu, Inst Clin Med Obstet & Gynecol, SF-90220 Oulu, Finland; [Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Univ Oulu, Inst Hlth Sci, SF-90220 Oulu, Finland; [Koerner, Antje; Kiess, Wieland] Univ Leipzig, Ctr Pediat Res, Dept Womens & Child Hlth, D-04317 Leipzig, Germany; [Pigeyre, Marie; Caiazzo, Roberto; Pattou, Francois] Lille Univ Hosp, F-59000 Lille, France; [Van Hul, Wim] Univ Antwerp, Dept Med Genet, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Gaal, Luc] Univ Antwerp Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, B-2650 Antwerp, Belgium; [Horber, Fritz] Clin Lindberg, Dept Med, Dept Surg & Internal Med, CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Horber, Fritz] Univ Bern, CH-3011 Bern, Switzerland; [Balkau, Beverley] Ctr Res Epidemiol & Populat Hlth CRESP, INSERM, U780, F-94800 Villejuif, France; [Balkau, Beverley] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Levy-Marchal, Claire] Hop Robert Debre, INSERM, U690, F-75935 Paris, France; [Rouskas, Konstantinos; Kouvatsi, Anastasia] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Genet Dev & Mol Biol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Hebebrand, Johannes; Hinney, Anke] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, D-45147 Essen, Germany; [Scherag, Andre] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Med Informat Biometry & Epidemiol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; [Meyre, David] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Koshimizu, Taka-aki] Jichi Med Univ, Div Mol Pharmacol, Dept Pharmacol, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan; [Froguel, Philippe] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Genom Common Dis, London W12 0NN, England","Froguel, P (reprint author), Lille Pasteur Inst, CNRS, UMR 8199, F-59000 Lille, France.",gtsuji@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp; p.froguel@imperial.ac.uk,"; Bonnefond, Amelie/O-2784-2017; Hinney, Anke/D-6953-2011; Caiazzo, Robert/D-1958-2013; TAUBER, Maithe/K-7386-2014; Kimura, Ikuo/B-4193-2015; Korner, Antje/B-3988-2015; Yengo, Loic/D-2692-2017; Meyre, David/D-7315-2011","Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta/0000-0002-2149-0630; Froguel, Philippe/0000-0003-2972-0784; Bonnefond, Amelie/0000-0001-9976-3005; Hinney, Anke/0000-0001-5659-0706; Buzzetti, Raffaella/0000-0003-1490-6041; Scherag, Andre/0000-0002-9406-4704; caiazzo, robert/0000-0001-5383-0540; Koshimizu, Taka-aki/0000-0001-5292-7535; Korner, Antje/0000-0001-6001-0356; Yengo, Loic/0000-0002-4272-9305; ","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST Program); Conseil Regional Nord Pas de Calais/FEDER; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Academy of Finland; University Hospital of Oulu (Finland); University of Oulu (Finland); European Commission (EURO-BLCS) [QLG1-CT-2000-01643]; Medical Research Council [G0500539, G0600705]","We are indebted to all subjects who participated in these studies.

Following the original proposal for the polyepoxide origin of lasalocid and isolasalocid(1) and the experimental determination of the origins of the oxygen and carbon atoms of both lasalocid and monensin, a unified stereochemical model for the biosynthesis of polyether ionophore antibiotics was proposed(2). The model was based on a cascade of nucleophilic ring closures of postulated polyepoxide substrates generated by stereospecific oxidation of all-trans polyene polyketide intermediates(2). Shortly thereafter, a related model was proposed for the biogenesis of marine ladder toxins, involving a series of nominally disfavoured anti-Baldwin, endo-tet epoxide-ring-opening reactions(3-5). Recently, we identified Lsd19 from the Streptomyces lasaliensis gene cluster as the epoxide hydrolase responsible for the epoxide-opening cyclization of bisepoxyprelasalocid A(6) to form lasalocid A(7,8). Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of Lsd19 in complex with its substrate and product analogue(9) to provide the first atomic structure-to our knowledge-of a natural enzyme capable of catalysing the disfavoured epoxide-opening cyclic ether formation. On the basis of our structural and computational studies, we propose a general mechanism for the enzymatic catalysis of polyether natural product biosynthesis.","[Hotta, Kinya; Chen, Xi; Li, Hao; Swaminathan, Kunchithapadam; Kim, Chu-Young] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Paton, Robert S.] Univ Oxford, Chem Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; [Minami, Atsushi; Oikawa, Hideaki] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Chem, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Mathews, Irimpan I.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Menlo Pk, CA 95124 USA; [Watanabe, Kenji] Univ Shizuoka, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmaceut Sci, Suruga Ku, Shizuoka 4228526, Japan; [Houk, Kendall N.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Kim, CY (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",chuyoung@nus.edu.sg,"Minami, Atsushi/A-4314-2012; Kim, Chu-Young/D-8849-2012; kikuchi, sachiko/G-5650-2012; Liu, Peng/D-1233-2013; Hotta, Kinya/A-2574-2009; Paton, Robert/A-4564-2010; Watanabe, Kenji/N-2012-2015","Kim, Chu-Young/0000-0003-3744-7802; Hotta, Kinya/0000-0002-9427-0081; Paton, Robert/0000-0002-0104-4166; ",Royal Commission; Fulbright-AstraZeneca; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [LS103]; National Institutes of Health [GM075962]; MEXT [22108002]; National University of Singapore Life Sciences Institute,"This work was supported by the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 and Fulbright-AstraZeneca Research Fellowship (R.S.P.), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. LS103) (K.W.), the National Institutes of Health grant GM075962 (K.N.H.), the MEXT research grant on innovative area 22108002 (H.O.), and the National University of Singapore Life Sciences Institute Young Investigator Award (C.-Y.K.).

This compound is central to the catabolism of a variety of aromatics, such as phenylalanine, lignin-related compounds or environmental contaminants(2,3). The key phenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase (epoxidase) of the pathway, PaaABCE(1,4,5), is also connected to the production of various primary and secondary metabolites(6-9), as well as to the virulence of certain pathogens(1,10,11). However, the enzyme complex has so far not been investigated in detail. Here we characterize the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase PaaABCE that, surprisingly, not only transforms phenylacetyl-CoA into its ring-1,2-epoxide, but also mediates the NADPH-dependent removal of the epoxide oxygen, regenerating phenylacetyl-CoA with formation of water. We provide evidence for a catalytic di-iron centre that is probably the key to the unprecedented deoxygenation of an organic compound by an oxygenase. Presumably, the bifunctionality is vital to avoid toxic intracellular epoxide levels if the subsequent catabolic steps are impeded. Our data suggest that detoxification is assisted by two thioesterases (PaaI and PaaY) forming non-reactive breakdown products. Hence, PaaABCE may harbour an intrinsic escape mechanism from its own toxic product and represents the archetype of a bifunctional oxygenase/deoxygenase. Analogous reactions may possibly be catalysed by other di-iron epoxidases.","[Teufel, Robin; Fuchs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Friedrich, Thorsten] Univ Freiburg, Fak Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Fuchs, G (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, Schanzlestr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",georg.fuchs@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for support; V.

Here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human-chimpanzee and human-chimpanzee-gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.","[Scally, Aylwyn; Goodhead, Ian; McCarthy, Shane; Tang, Y.

Whole-cell electron cryotomography further shows that the sheaths appear as long tubular structures in either extended or contracted conformations that are connected to the inner membrane by a distinct basal structure.

A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science(2-5), the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.","[Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Phys Lab, CNRS, UMR5672, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Res Ctr OPTIMAS, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Lutz, Eric] Univ Augsburg, Dept Phys, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany","Lutz, E (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Complex Quantum Syst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",eric.lutz@fu-berlin.de,"Lutz, Eric/C-2713-2008","Berut, Antoine/0000-0001-8549-086X","DFG [LU1382/1-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), DAAD; Research Center of the DFG [Transregio 49]","This work was supported by the Emmy Noether Program of the DFG (contract no.

The attraction of nanostructures lies in two intimately connected features: local intensity enhancement and sub-wavelength confinement of optical fields. Local intensity enhancement facilitates access to the strong-field regime and has already sparked various applications, whereas spatial localization has the potential to generate strong-field dynamics exclusive to nanostructures. However, the observation of features unattainable in gaseous media is challenged by many-body effects and material damage, which arise under intense illumination of dense systems(16-19). Here, we non-destructively access this regime in the solid state by employing single plasmonic nanotips and few-cycle mid-infrared pulses, making use of the wavelength-dependence of the interaction, that is, the ponderomotive energy. We investigate strong-field photoelectron emission and acceleration from single nanostructures over a broad spectral range, and find kinetic energies of hundreds of electronvolts. We observe the transition to a new regime in strong-field dynamics, in which the electrons escape the nanolocalized field within a fraction of an optical half-cycle. The transition into this regime, characterized by a spatial adiabaticity parameter, would require relativistic electrons in the absence of nanostructures. These results establish new degrees of freedom for the manipulation and control of electron dynamics on femtosecond and attosecond timescales, combining optical near-fields and nanoscopic sources.","[Herink, G.; Solli, D.

The methods of choice are X-ray and electron diffraction, which are routinely used to determine atomic positions with sub-a ngstrom spatial resolution. Although both methods are currently limited to probing dynamics on timescales longer than a picosecond, the recent development of femtosecond sources of X-ray pulses and electron beams suggests that they might soon be capable of taking ultrafast snapshots of biological molecules(1,2) and condensed-phase systems(3-6) undergoing structural changes. The past decade has also witnessed the emergence of an alternative imaging approach based on laser-ionized bursts of coherent electron wave packets that self-interrogate the parent molecular structure(7-11). Here we show that this phenomenon can indeed be exploited for laser-induced electron diffraction(10) (LIED), to image molecular structures with subangstrom precision and exposure times of a few femtoseconds. We apply the method to oxygen and nitrogen molecules, which on strong-field ionization at three mid-infrared wavelengths (1.7, 2.0 and 2.3 mu m) emit photoelectrons with a momentum distribution from which we extract diffraction patterns. The long wavelength is essential for achieving atomic-scale spatial resolution, and the wavelength variation is equivalent to taking snapshots at different times. We show that the method has the sensitivity to measure a 0.1 angstrom displacement in the oxygen bond length occurring in a time interval of similar to 5 fs, which establishes LIED as a promising approach for the imaging of gas-phase molecules with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution.","[Blaga, Cosmin I.; DiChiara, Anthony D.; Sistrunk, Emily; Zhang, Kaikai; Agostini, Pierre; DiMauro, Louis F.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Xu, Junliang; Lin, C.

In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron(1). In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon(2), but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils(3) to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 +/- 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) x 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron(4). We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur(5).","[Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Mucci, Alfonso] McGill Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada","Gelinas, Y (reprint author), Concordia Univ, GEOTOP, 7141 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada.",ygelinas@alcor.concordia.ca,"Gelinas, Yves/K-4019-2013","Gelinas, Yves/0000-0001-5751-8378",NSERC; CFI; FQRNT,"This work is dedicated to the memory of J.I.

The origins of the first recognized Cretaceous stem-group flea, Tarwinia, remains highly controversial(1). Here we report fossils of the oldest definitive fleas-giant forms from the Middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods of China. They exhibit many defining features of fleas but retain primitive traits such as non-jumping hindlegs. More importantly, all have stout and elongate sucking siphons for piercing the hides of their hosts, implying that these fleas may be rooted among the pollinating 'long siphonate' scorpionflies of the Mesozoic.

May analysed large networks in which species interact at random(1,2,6). However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed(7,8) or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions(9,10). Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness(11-14) in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.","[Allesina, Stefano; Tang, Si] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Allesina, Stefano] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Allesina, S (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",sallesina@uchicago.edu,,"Allesina, Stefano/0000-0003-0313-8374",National Science Foundation [EF0827493],"We thank J.

Degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family members are mechanotransducers in C. elegans(8) and potentially in D. melanogaster(9); however, a direct role of its mammalian homologues in sensing mechanical force has not been shown. Recently, Piezo1 (also known as Fam38a) and Piezo2 (also known as Fam38b) were identified as components of mechanically activated channels in mammals(10). The Piezo family are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins. It is unknown whether they function in mechanical sensing in vivo and, if they do, which mechanosensory modalities they mediate. Here we study the physiological role of the single Piezo member in D. melanogaster (Dmpiezo; also known as CG8486). Dmpiezo expression in human cells induces mechanically activated currents, similar to its mammalian counterparts(11). Behavioural responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were severely reduced in Dmpiezo knockout larvae, whereas responses to another noxious stimulus or touch were not affected. Knocking down Dmpiezo in sensory neurons that mediate nociception and express the DEG/ENaC ion channel pickpocket (ppk) was sufficient to impair responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, expression of Dmpiezo in these same neurons rescued the phenotype of the constitutive Dmpiezo knockout larvae. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings from ppk-positive neurons revealed a Dmpiezo-dependent, mechanically activated current. Finally, we found that Dmpiezo and ppk function in parallel pathways in ppk-positive cells, and that mechanical nociception is abolished in the absence of both channels. These data demonstrate the physiological relevance of the Piezo family in mechanotransduction in vivo, supporting a role of Piezo proteins in mechanosensory nociception.","[Kim, Sung Eun; Coste, Bertrand; Chadha, Abhishek; Cook, Boaz; Patapoutian, Ardem] Scripps Res Inst TSRI, Dorris Neurosci Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Patapoutian, Ardem] Novartis Res Fdn GNF, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Cook, B (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst TSRI, Dorris Neurosci Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",bcook@scripps.edu; apatapou@gnf.org,"KIM, SUNG EUN/E-4918-2011",,National Institutes of Health; Novartis Research Foundation; Skaggs Institute,We thank Y.

Over decades, research has failed to translate over 1,000 experimental treatments from discovery in cells and rodents to use in humans(2-4), a scientific crisis that gave rise to the prevailing belief that pharmacological neuroprotection is not feasible or practicable in higher-order brains. To provide a strategy for advancing stroke therapy, we used higher-order gyrencephalic non-human primates, which bear genetic, anatomical and behavioural similarities to humans(5,6) and tested neuroprotection by PSD-95 inhibitors-promising compounds that uncouple postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 from neurotoxic signalling pathways(7-10). Here we show that stroke damage can be prevented in non-human primates in which a PSD-95 inhibitor is administered after stroke onset in clinically relevant situations. This treatment reduced infarct volumes as gauged by magnetic resonance imaging and histology, preserved the capacity of ischaemic cells to maintain gene transcription in genome-wide screens of ischaemic brain tissue, and significantly preserved neurological function in neuro-behavioural assays. The degree of tissue neuroprotection by magnetic resonance imaging corresponded strongly to the preservation of neurological function, supporting the intuitive but unproven dictum that integrity of brain tissue can reflect functional outcome. Our findings establish that tissue neuroprotection and improved functional outcome after stroke is unequivocally achievable in gyrencephalic non-human primates treated with PSD-95 inhibitors. Efforts must ensue to translate these findings to humans.","[Cook, Douglas J.; Teves, Lucy; Tymianski, Michael] Toronto Western Hosp, Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Tymianski, Michael] Univ Toronto, Dept Physiol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Tymianski, Michael] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Tymianski, Michael] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Tymianski, M (reprint author), Toronto Western Hosp, Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.",mike.tymianski@uhn.ca,,,Canadian Stroke Network; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario [NA 6988]; Canada Research Chair,"This work was supported by grants to M.T. from the Canadian Stroke Network and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario, grant NA 6988.

To meet these challenges, the mechanisms that determine healthy ageing must be understood and controlled. Sirtuins are highly conserved deacetylases that have been shown to regulate lifespan in yeast, nematodes and fruitflies(1). However, the role of sirtuins in regulating worm and fly lifespan has recently become controversial(2). Moreover, the role of the seven mammalian sirtuins, SIRT1 to SIRT7 (homologues of the yeast sirtuin Sir2), in regulating lifespan is unclear(3). Here we show that male, but not female, transgenic mice overexpressing Sirt6 (ref. 4) have a significantly longer lifespan than wild-type mice. Gene expression analysis revealed significant differences between male Sirt6-transgenic mice and male wild-type mice: transgenic males displayed lower serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), higher levels of IGF-binding protein 1 and altered phosphorylation levels of major components of IGF1 signalling, a key pathway in the regulation of lifespan(5). This study shows the regulation of mammalian lifespan by a sirtuin family member and has important therapeutic implications for age-related diseases.","[Kanfi, Yariv; Naiman, Shoshana; Peshti, Victoria; Nahum, Liat; Cohen, Haim Y.] Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Amir, Gail] Hadassah Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Amir, Gail] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Zinman, Guy; Bar-Joseph, Ziv] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Lane Ctr Computat Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA","Cohen, HY (reprint author), Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",Haim.Cohen@biu.ac.il,,"Bar-Joseph, Ziv/0000-0003-3430-6051",National Institutes of Health [1RO1 GM085022]; Israeli Academy of Sciences; United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation; Israel Cancer Association; Koret Foundation; Israel Cancer Research Fund; Israel Health Ministry [41/1]; Israel Science Foundation; European Research Council,"We thank R.

The causes leading to such impairment are only poorly understood and effective treatments are slow to emerge(2). Here we show that cognitive capacities in the neurodegenerating brain are constrained by an epigenetic blockade of gene transcription that is potentially reversible. This blockade is mediated by histone deacetylase 2, which is increased by Alzheimer's-disease-related neurotoxic insults in vitro, in two mouse models of neurodegeneration and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Histone deacetylase 2 associates with and reduces the histone acetylation of genes important for learning and memory, which show a concomitant decrease in expression. Importantly, reversing the build-up of histone deacetylase 2 by short-hairpin-RNA-mediated knockdown unlocks the repression of these genes, reinstates structural and synaptic plasticity, and abolishes neurodegeneration-associated memory impairments. These findings advocate for the development of selective inhibitors of histone deacetylase 2 and suggest that cognitive capacities following neurodegeneration are not entirely lost, but merely impaired by this epigenetic blockade.","[Graeff, Johannes; Rei, Damien; Guan, Ji-Song; Wang, Wen-Yuan; Seo, Jinsoo; Kahn, Martin; Su, Susan C.; Samiei, Alireza; Joseph, Nadine; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Graeff, Johannes; Rei, Damien; Guan, Ji-Song; Wang, Wen-Yuan; Seo, Jinsoo; Su, Susan C.; Joseph, Nadine; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Graeff, Johannes; Guan, Ji-Song; Wang, Wen-Yuan; Hennig, Krista M.; Nieland, Thomas J.

Here we show in mice that localized vaccinia virus (VACV) skin infection generates long-lived non-recirculating CD8(+) skin T-RM cells that reside within the entire skin. These skin T-RM cells are potent effector cells, and are superior to circulating central memory T (T-CM) cells at providing rapid long-term protection against cutaneous re-infection. We find that CD8(+) T cells are rapidly recruited to skin after acute VACV infection. CD8(+) T-cell recruitment to skin is independent of CD4(+) T cells and interferon-c, but requires the expression of E-and P-selectin ligands by CD8(+) T cells. Using parabiotic mice, we further show that circulating CD8(+) T-CM and CD8(+) skin T-RM cells are both generated after skin infection; however, CD8(+) T-CM cells recirculate between blood and lymph nodes whereas T-RM cells remain in the skin. Cutaneous CD8(+) T-RM cells produce effector cytokines and persist for at least 6 months after infection. Mice with CD8(+) skin T-RM cells rapidly cleared a subsequent re-infection with VACV whereas mice with circulating T-CM but no skin T-RM cells showed greatly impaired viral clearance, indicating that T-RM cells provide superior protection. Finally, we show that T-RM cells generated as a result of localized VACV skin infection reside not only in the site of infection, but also populate the entire skin surface and remain present for many months. Repeated re-infections lead to progressive accumulation of highly protective T-RM cells in non-involved skin. These findings have important implications for our understanding of protective immune memory at epithelial interfaces with the environment, and suggest novel strategies for vaccines that protect against tissue tropic organisms.","[Jiang, Xiaodong; Clark, Rachael A.; Liu, Luzheng; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C.; Kupper, Thomas S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jiang, Xiaodong; Clark, Rachael A.; Liu, Luzheng; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C.; Kupper, Thomas S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Harvard Skin Dis Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wagers, Amy J.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst,Joslin Diabet Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Kupper, TS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tkupper@partners.org,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI041707, R37AI025082, TR01AI097128]","We thank T.

It is believed that through these projections layers can influence each other's response to sensory stimuli, but the specific role that each layer has in cortical processing is still poorly understood. Here we show that layer six in the primary visual cortex of the mouse has a crucial role in controlling the gain of visually evoked activity in neurons of the upper layers without changing their tuning to orientation. This gain modulation results from the coordinated action of layer six intracortical projections to superficial layers and deep projections to the thalamus, with a substantial role of the intracortical circuit. This study establishes layer six as a major mediator of cortical gain modulation and suggests that it could be a node through which convergent inputs from several brain areas can regulate the earliest steps of cortical visual processing.","[Olsen, Shawn R.; Bortone, Dante S.; Adesnik, Hillel; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Olsen, Shawn R.; Bortone, Dante S.; Adesnik, Hillel; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Scanziani, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",srolsen@ucsd.edu; massimo@biomail.ucsd.edu,,,Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; NINDS [5T32NS007220-28]; National Institutes of Health [RO1 NS069010]; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"We are grateful to M.

Neisseria require iron for survival and can extract it directly from human transferrin for transport across the outer membrane. The transport system consists of TbpA, an integral outer membrane protein, and TbpB, a co-receptor attached to the cell surface; both proteins are potentially important vaccine and therapeutic targets. Two key questions driving Neisseria research are how human transferrin is specifically targeted, and how the bacteria liberate iron from transferrin at neutral pH. To address these questions, we solved crystal structures of the TbpA-transferrin complex and of the corresponding co-receptor TbpB. We characterized the TbpB-transferrin complex by small-angle X-ray scattering and the TbpA-TbpB-transferrin complex by electron microscopy. Our studies provide a rational basis for the specificity of TbpA for human transferrin, show how TbpA promotes iron release from transferrin, and elucidate how TbpB facilitates this process.","[Noinaj, Nicholas; Easley, Nicole C.; Oke, Muse; Boura, Evzen; Buchanan, Susan K.] NIDDK, Mol Biol Lab, US Natl Inst Hlth, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Mizuno, Naoko; Steven, Alasdair C.] NIAMSD, Struct Biol Lab, US Natl Inst Hlth, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gumbart, James] Argonne Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Steere, Ashley N.; Mason, Anne B.] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Zak, Olga; Aisen, Philip] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Evans, Robert W.] Brunel Univ, Sch Hlth Sci & Social Care, Div Biosci, Metalloprot Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Gorringe, Andrew R.] Hlth Protect Agcy, Salisbury SP2 8NY, Wilts, England","Buchanan, SK (reprint author), NIDDK, Mol Biol Lab, US Natl Inst Hlth, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",skbuchan@helix.nih.gov,"Boura, Evzen/I-2626-2012; Boura, Evzen/G-5275-2014","Tajkhorshid, Emad/0000-0001-8434-1010","NIH, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; EPSRC Research Committee; NIH, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; USPHS [R01-DK21739]; AHA [10PRE4200010]; NIH [R01-GM086749, U54-GM087519, P41-RR05969]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [W-31-109-Eng-38]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources","N.N., N.C.E., M.O., E.B. and S.K.B. are supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Whereas Ub-PCNA can signal for recruitment of translesion DNA polymerases, SUMO-PCNA signals for recruitment of the anti-recombinogenic DNA helicase Srs2. It remains unclear how receptors such as Srs2 specifically recognize substrates after conjugation to Ub and Ubls. Here we show, through structural, biochemical and functional studies, that the Srs2 carboxy-terminal domain harbours tandem receptor motifs that interact independently with PCNA and SUMO and that both motifs are required to recognize SUMO-PCNA specifically. The mechanism presented is pertinent to understanding how other receptors specifically recognize Ub- and Ubl-modified substrates to facilitate signal transduction.","[Armstrong, Anthony A.; Mohideen, Firaz; Lima, Christopher D.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Lima, CD (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",limac@mskcc.org,,"Lima, Christopher/0000-0002-9163-6092","NIH NCRR [RR-15301, P41RR012408]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; NIH [R01 GM065872, F32 GM086066]","We thank J.

Light passing through the atmosphere is strongly linearly polarized by scattering (from air molecules, aerosols and cloud particles) and by reflection (from oceans and land(2)). Spectropolarimetric observations of local patches of Earth's sky light from the ground contain signatures of oxygen, ozone and water, and are used to characterize the properties of clouds and aerosols(3,4). When applied to exoplanets, ground-based spectropolarimetry can better constrain properties of atmospheres and surfaces than can standard intensity spectroscopy(5-9). Here we report disk-integrated linear polarization spectra of Earthshine, which is sunlight that has been first reflected by Earth and then reflected back to Earth by the Moon(10-13). The observations allow us to determine the fractional contribution of clouds and ocean surface, and are sensitive to visible areas of vegetation as small as 10 per cent.

However, the realization of this synthetic potential requires the ability to functionalize selectively one C-H bond in a compound containing many such bonds and an array of functional groups. The site-selective functionalization of aliphatic C-H bonds is one of the greatest challenges that must be met for C-H bond functionalization to be used widely in complex-molecule synthesis(1,3,5,6), and processes catalysed by transition-metals provide the opportunity to control selectivity(7,8). Current methods for catalytic, aliphatic C-H bond functionalization typically rely on the presence of one inherently reactive C-H bond(9,10), or on installation and subsequent removal of directing groups that are not components of the desired molecule(8). To overcome these limitations, we sought catalysts and reagents that would facilitate aliphatic C-H bond functionalization at a single site, with chemoselectivity derived from the properties of the catalyst and site-selectivity directed by common functional groups(11) contained in both the reactant and the desired product. Here we show that the combination of an iridium-phenanthroline catalyst and a dihydridosilane reagent leads to the site-selective gamma-functionalization of primary C-H bonds controlled by a hydroxyl group, the most common functional group in natural products(12). The scope of the reaction encompasses alcohols and ketones bearing many substitution patterns and auxiliary functional groups; this broad scope suggests that this methodology will be suitable for the site-selective and diastereoselective functionalization of complex natural products.","[Simmons, Eric M.; Hartwig, John F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hartwig, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 91820 USA.",jhartwig@berkeley.edu,,"Simmons, Eric/0000-0002-3854-1561",US National Science Foundation [CHE-0910641]; US National Institutes of Health [GM087901],"We thank the US National Science Foundation (CHE-0910641 to J.F.H.) and the US National Institutes of Health (GM087901 to E.M.S.) for funding this work, and Johnson Matthey for a gift of [Ir(cod)OMe]<INF>2</INF>.",,30,174,174,11,187,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Mar,2012,483,7387,,,,,70,73,,10.1038/nature10785,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,900HP,WOS:000300877900046,22382981,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Observations of past plate motion derived from marine magnetic anomalies provide evidence of how continental deformation may contribute to plate driving forces(2-8). A decrease in convergence rate at the inception of continental collision is expected because of the greater buoyancy of continental than oceanic lithosphere(2,3), but post-collisional rates are less well understood. Slowing of convergence has generally been attributed to the development of high topography that further resists convergent motion(7-10); however, the role of deforming continental mantle lithosphere on plate motions has not previously been considered. Here I show that the rate of India's penetration into Eurasia has decreased exponentially since their collision. The exponential decrease in convergence rate suggests that contractional strain across Tibet has been constant throughout the collision at a rate of 7.03 x 10(-16) s(-1), which matches the current rate. A constant bulk strain rate of the orogen suggests that convergent motion is resisted by constant average stress (constant force) applied to a relatively uniform layer or interface at depth. This finding follows new evidence that the mantle lithosphere beneath Tibet is intact(11), which supports the interpretation that the long-term strain history of Tibet reflects deformation of the mantle lithosphere. Under conditions of constant stress and strength, the deforming continental lithosphere creates a type of viscous resistance that affects plate motion irrespective of how topography evolved.","Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Clark, MK (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",marinkc@umich.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [EAR-0549748, EAR-0908711]","I thank E.

However, little is known about the ecology of early forests or how changes in early terrestrial ecosystems influenced global processes. One of the most famous palaeontological records for this time is the 'oldest fossil forest' at Riverside Quarry, Gilboa, New York, USA, discovered in the 1920s(4,5). Hundreds of large Eospermatopteris sandstone casts, now thought to represent the bases of standing cladoxylopsid trees(6), were recovered from a horizon that was originally interpreted as a muddy swamp. After quarry operations ceased, relatively minor outcrops of similar fossils at nearby localities have provided limited opportunities to evaluate this pervasive view using modern methods(7,8). In 2010, removal of the quarry backfill enabled reappraisal of the palaeoecology of this important site. Here we describe a 1,200 m(2) map showing numerous Eospermatopteris root systems in life position within a mixed-age stand of trees. Unexpectedly, large woody rhizomes with adventitious roots and aerial branch systems identified as aneurophytalean progymnosperms run between, and probably climb into, Eospermatopteris trees. We describe the overall habit for these surprisingly large aneurophytaleans, the earliest fossil group having wood produced by a bifacial vascular cambium. The site also provides evidence for arborescence within lycopsids, extending the North American range for trees in this ecologically critical group. The rooting horizon is a dark grey sandy mudstone showing limited root penetration. Although clearly belonging to a wetland coastal plain environment(9), the forest was probably limited in duration and subject to periodic disturbance. These observations provide fundamental clarification of the palaeoecology of this mixed-group early forest, with important implications for interpreting coeval assemblage data worldwide.","[Stein, William E.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Berry, Christopher M.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, S Glam, Wales; [Hernick, Linda VanAller; Mannolini, Frank] New York State Museum & Sci Serv, Albany, NY 12230 USA","Stein, WE (reprint author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",stein@binghamton.edu,,"Berry, Christopher/0000-0001-9521-5618",New York State Museum; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F010699/1],"Financial support was provided by the New York State Museum.

The human MSY (male-specific region of Y chromosome) retains only three percent of the ancestral autosomes' genes owing to genetic decay(4,5). This evolutionary decay was driven by a series of five 'stratification' events. Each event suppressed X-Y crossing over within a chromosome segment or 'stratum', incorporated that segment into the MSY and subjected its genes to the erosive forces that attend the absence of crossing over(2,6). The last of these events occurred 30 million years ago, 5 million years before the human and Old World monkey lineages diverged. Although speculation abounds regarding ongoing decay and looming extinction of the human Y chromosome(7-10), remarkably little is known about how many MSY genes were lost in the human lineage in the 25 million years that have followed its separation from the Old World monkey lineage. To investigate this question, we sequenced the MSY of the rhesus macaque, an Old World monkey, and compared it to the human MSY. We discovered that during the last 25 million years MSY gene loss in the human lineage was limited to the youngest stratum (stratum 5), which comprises three percent of the human MSY. In the older strata, which collectively comprise the bulk of the human MSY, gene loss evidently ceased more than 25 million years ago. Likewise, the rhesus MSY has not lost any older genes (from strata 1-4) during the past 25 million years, despite its major structural differences to the human MSY. The rhesus MSY is simpler, with few amplified gene families or palindromes that might enable intrachromosomal recombination and repair. We present an empirical reconstruction of human MSY evolution in which each stratum transitioned from rapid, exponential loss of ancestral genes to strict conservation through purifying selection.","[Hughes, Jennifer F.; Skaletsky, Helen; Brown, Laura G.; Pyntikova, Tatyana; Cho, Ting-Jan; Koutseva, Natalia; Rozen, Steve; Page, David C.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Whitehead Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hughes, Jennifer F.; Skaletsky, Helen; Brown, Laura G.; Pyntikova, Tatyana; Cho, Ting-Jan; Koutseva, Natalia; Rozen, Steve; Page, David C.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Graves, Tina; Fulton, Robert S.; Kremitzki, Colin; Courtney, Laura; Veizer, Joelle; Kotkiewicz, Holland; Warren, Wesley C.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Dugan, Shannon; Ding, Yan; Buhay, Christian J.; Wang, Qiaoyan; Shen, Hua; Holder, Michael; Villasana, Donna; Nazareth, Lynne V.; Cree, Andrew; Muzny, Donna M.; Gibbs, Richard A.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Hughes, JF (reprint author), MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Whitehead Inst, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",jhughes@wi.mit.edu,,"Rozen, Steven G./0000-0002-4288-0056",National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Charles A.

Although this view has gained much support from behavioural and electrophysiological studies(1-10), the hypothesis that extinction causes the partial erasure of fear memories remains viable. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy(11,12), we investigated how neural circuits are modified by fear learning and extinction by examining the formation and elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer-V pyramidal neurons in the mouse frontal association cortex. Here we show that fear conditioning by pairing an auditory cue with a footshock increases the rate of spine elimination. By contrast, fear extinction by repeated presentation of the same auditory cue without a footshock increases the rate of spine formation. The degrees of spine remodelling induced by fear conditioning and extinction strongly correlate with the expression and extinction of conditioned fear responses, respectively. Notably, spine elimination and formation induced by fear conditioning and extinction occur on the same dendritic branches in a cue-and location-specific manner: cue-specific extinction causes formation of dendritic spines within a distance of two micrometres from spines that were eliminated after fear conditioning. Furthermore, reconditioning preferentially induces elimination of dendritic spines that were formed after extinction. Thus, within vastly complex neuronal networks, fear conditioning, extinction and reconditioning lead to opposing changes at the level of individual synapses. These findings also suggest that fear memory traces are partially erased after extinction.","[Lai, Cora Sau Wan; Gan, Wen-Biao] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Mol Neurobiol Program,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Franke, Thomas F.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Franke, Thomas F.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Gan, WB (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Mol Neurobiol Program,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, 540 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",gan@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [NS047325]; Alzheimer's Association; National Science Foundation [IOS-0757780]; NARSAD; G.

Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding(3-5), the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network(6-10). However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy(11), we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.","[Fu, Min; Yu, Xinzhu; Zuo, Yi] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Lu, Ju] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lu, Ju] Stanford Univ, James H Clark Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Zuo, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",yizuo@ucsc.edu,,,DANA Foundation; National Institutes of Mental Health,"We thank D.

A common mechanism that underlies susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is abnormalities in the duration (for example, short or long QT syndromes and heart failure)(3-5) or pattern (for example, Brugada's syndrome)(6) of myocardial repolarization. Here we provide molecular evidence that links circadian rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice. Specifically, we show that cardiac ion-channel expression and QT-interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent oscillator, kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15). Klf15 transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2), a critical subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current(7). Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repolarization and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. These findings identify circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for cardiac arrhythmogenesis.","[Jeyaraj, Darwin; Haldar, Saptarsi M.; Lu, Yuan; Eapen, Betty L.; Sharma, Nikunj; Jain, Mukesh K.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Case Cardiovasc Res Inst, Harrington Heart & Vasc Inst, Dept Med,Sch Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Jeyaraj, Darwin; Wan, Xiaoping; Ficker, Eckhard; Cutler, Michael J.; Rosenbaum, David S.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Heart & Vasc Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44109 USA; [McCauley, Mark D.; Wehrens, Xander H.

However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF (V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug(2-4). To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF (V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF (V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10% of all colon cancers(2,3,5)), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.","[Prahallad, Anirudh; Sun, Chong; Huang, Sidong; Beijersbergen, Roderick L.; Bernards, Rene] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Carcinogenesis, Ctr Biomed Genet, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Prahallad, Anirudh; Sun, Chong; Huang, Sidong; Beijersbergen, Roderick L.; Bernards, Rene] Netherlands Canc Inst, Canc Genom Ctr, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Zecchin, Davide; Bardelli, Alberto] Univ Turin, Lab Mol Genet, Inst Canc Res & Treatment, Sch Med, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Bardelli, Alberto] FIRC IFOM Inst Mol Oncol, I-20100 Milan, Italy; [Salazar, Ramon] IDIBELL, Inst Catala Oncol LHospitalet de Llobregat, Lhospitalet Barcelona 08907, Spain","Bernards, R (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Carcinogenesis, Ctr Biomed Genet, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.bernards@nki.nl,"Di Nicolantonio, Federica/A-2503-2011","Di Nicolantonio, Federica/0000-0001-9618-2010; Sun, Chong/0000-0001-9008-2158; Bernards, Rene/0000-0001-8677-3423","EU [259015]; European Research Council; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Dutch Cancer Society; Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI); Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [9970]; Italian Ministry of University and Research; Italian Ministry of Health, Regione Piemonte; Fondazione Piemontese per la Ricerca sul Cancro","We thank P.

One such modification, the acetylation of lysine 56 (H3K56ac) in the amino-terminal alpha-helix (alpha N) of histone H3, has been implicated in the regulation of nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair, and nucleosome disassembly during gene transcription(4-10). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histone chaperone Rtt106 contributes to the deposition of newly synthesized H3K56ac-carrying H3-H4 complex on replicating DNA(5), but it is unclear how Rtt106 binds H3-H4 and specifically recognizes H3K56ac as there is no apparent acetylated lysine reader domain in Rtt106. Here, we show that two domains of Rtt106 are involved in a combinatorial recognition of H3-H4. An N-terminal domain homodimerizes and interacts with H3-H4 independently of acetylation while a double pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain binds the K56-containing region of H3. Affinity is markedly enhanced upon acetylation of K56, an effect that is probably due to increased conformational entropy of the aN helix of H3. Our data support a mode of interaction where the N-terminal homodimeric domain of Rtt106 intercalates between the two H3-H4 components of the (H3-H4)(2) tetramer while two double PH domains in the Rtt106 dimer interact with each of the two H3K56ac sites in (H3-H4)(2). We show that the Rtt106-(H3-H4)(2) interaction is important for gene silencing and the DNA damage response.","[Su, Dan; Hu, Qi; Li, Qing; Cui, Gaofeng; Fazly, Ahmed; Davies, Brian A.; Botuyan, Maria Victoria; Zhang, Zhiguo; Mer, Georges] Mayo Clin, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Thompson, James R.] Mayo Clin, Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, Rochester, MN 55905 USA","Zhang, ZG (reprint author), Mayo Clin, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",zhang.zhiguo@mayo.edu; mer.georges@mayo.edu,"Cui, Gaofeng/A-1107-2013; hu, qi/K-1462-2014","Cui, Gaofeng/0000-0001-5267-9033; , /0000-0003-3279-0425","US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [W-31-109-ENG-38]; National Institutes of Health","We are grateful to N.

In each of these receptor families, the pore, which is formed by carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains, is regulated by signals that are detected by large cytosolic structures. InsP(3)R gating is initiated by InsP(3) binding to the InsP(3)-binding core (IBC, residues 224-604 of InsP(3)R1)(2) and it requires the suppressor domain (SD, residues 1-223 of InsP(3)R1)(2-8). Here we present structures of the amino-terminal region (NT, residues 1-604) of rat InsP(3)R1 with (3.6 angstrom) and without (3.0 angstrom) InsP(3) bound. The arrangement of the three NT domains, SD, IBC-beta and IBC-alpha, identifies two discrete interfaces (alpha and beta) between the IBC and SD. Similar interfaces occur between equivalent domains (A, B and C) in RyR1 (ref. 9). The orientations of the three domains when docked into a tetrameric structure of InsP(3)R(10) and of the ABC domains docked into RyR(9) are remarkably similar. The importance of the alpha-interface for activation of InsP(3)R and RyR is confirmed by mutagenesis and, for RyR, by disease-causing mutations(9,11,12). Binding of InsP(3) causes partial closure of the clam-like IBC, disrupting the beta-interface and pulling the SD towards the IBC. This reorients an exposedSDloop ('hotspot' (HS) loop) that is essential for InsP(3)R activation(7). The loop is conserved in RyR and includes mutations that are associated with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease(9,11,12). The HS loop interacts with an adjacent NT, suggesting that activation re-arranges inter-subunit interactions. The A domain of RyR functionally replaced the SD in full-length InsP(3)R, and an InsP(3)R in which its C-terminal transmembrane region was replaced by that from RyR1 was gated by InsP(3) and blocked by ryanodine. Activation mechanisms are conserved between InsP(3)R and RyR. Allosteric modulation of two similar domain interfaces within an N-terminal subunit reorients the first domain (SD or A domain), allowing it, through interactions of the second domain of an adjacent subunit (IBC-beta or B domain), to gate the pore.","[Seo, Min-Duk; Ishiyama, Noboru; Stathopulos, Peter B.; Ikura, Mitsuhiko] Univ Toronto, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Seo, Min-Duk; Ishiyama, Noboru; Stathopulos, Peter B.; Ikura, Mitsuhiko] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Velamakanni, Saroj; Rossi, Ana M.; Khan, Samir A.; Dale, Philippa; Taylor, Colin W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pharmacol, Cambridge CB2 1PD, England; [Li, Congmin; Ames, James B.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Ikura, M (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada.",mikura@uhnres.utoronto.ca; cwt1000@cam.ac.uk,,,"Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario [T-7181]; National Institutes of Health Research [EY012347, NS059969]; Wellcome Trust [085295]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/H009736]; Medical Research Council [G0900049]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; National Research Foundation of Korea [2009-352-E00006]","We thank P.

In cells, most COPII vesicles are approximately 60-80 nm in diameter, yet some must increase their size to accommodate 300-400 nm procollagen fibres or chylomicrons. Impaired COPII function results in collagen deposition defects, craniolenticulo-sutural dysplasia, or chylomicron retention disease, but mechanisms to enlarge COPII coats have remained elusive. Here, we identified the ubiquitin ligase CUL3-KLHL12 as a regulator of COPII coat formation. CUL3-KLHL12 catalyses the monoubiquitylation of the COPII-component SEC31 and drives the assembly of large COPII coats. As a result, ubiquitylation by CUL3-KLHL12 is essential for collagen export, yet less important for the transport of small cargo. We conclude that monoubiquitylation controls the size and function of a vesicle coat.","[Jin, Lingyan; Pahuja, Kanika Bajaj; Wickliffe, Katherine E.; Gorur, Amita; Baumgaertel, Christine; Schekman, Randy; Rape, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pahuja, Kanika Bajaj; Gorur, Amita; Schekman, Randy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Rape, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mrape@berkeley.edu,,"Bajaj Pahuja, Kanika/0000-0001-8977-9812",Pew Foundation; NIH (NIGMS); Howard Hughes Medical Institute; CIRM,"We thank B.

In bacteria, ribosome recycling requires ribosome recycling factor and elongation factor G, and several structures of bacterial recycling complexes have been determined. In the eukaryotic and archaeal kingdoms, however, recycling involves the ABC-type ATPase ABCE1 and little is known about its structural basis. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of eukaryotic and archaeal ribosome recycling complexes containing ABCE1 and the termination factor paralogue Pelota. These structures reveal the overall binding mode of ABCE1 to be similar to canonical translation factors. Moreover, the iron-sulphur cluster domain of ABCE1 interacts with and stabilizes Pelota in a conformation that reaches towards the peptidyl transferase centre, thus explaining how ABCE1 may stimulate peptide-release activity of canonical termination factors. Using the mechanochemical properties of ABCE1, a conserved mechanism in archaea and eukaryotes is suggested that couples translation termination to recycling, and eventually to re-initiation.","[Becker, Thomas; Franckenberg, Sibylle; Wickles, Stephan; Anger, Andreas M.; Armache, Jean-Paul; Sieber, Heidemarie; Ungewickell, Charlotte; Berninghausen, Otto; Karcher, Annette; Hopfner, Karl-Peter; Beckmann, Roland] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Becker, Thomas; Franckenberg, Sibylle; Wickles, Stephan; Anger, Andreas M.; Armache, Jean-Paul; Sieber, Heidemarie; Ungewickell, Charlotte; Berninghausen, Otto; Karcher, Annette; Hopfner, Karl-Peter; Beckmann, Roland] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich CiPSM, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Shoemaker, Christopher J.; Green, Rachel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Karcher, Annette] Tietz Video & Image Proc Syst GmbH, D-82131 Gauting, Germany; [Thomm, Michael] Univ Icking, D-82057 Icking, Germany; [Thomm, Michael] Univ Regensburg, Dept Microbiol, NWF Biol & Preclin Med 3, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany","Beckmann, R (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",becker@lmb.uni-muenchen.de; beckmann@lmb.uni-muenchen.de,"Hopfner, Karl-Peter/B-6864-2014","Hopfner, Karl-Peter/0000-0002-4528-8357","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB594, SFB646]; National Institutes of Health [U19 AI083025]; Fonds der chemischen Industrie","We thank A.

The pulsar wind originates close to the light cylinder, the surface at which the pulsar co-rotation velocity equals the speed of light, and carries away much of the rotational energy lost by the pulsar. Initially the wind is dominated by electromagnetic energy (Poynting flux) but later this is converted to the kinetic energy of bulk motion(2). It is unclear exactly where this takes place and to what speed the wind is accelerated. Although some preferred models imply a gradual acceleration over the entire distance from the magnetosphere to the point at which the wind terminates(3,4), a rapid acceleration close to the light cylinder cannot be excluded(5,6). Here we report that the recent observations of pulsed, very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the Crab pulsar(7-9) are explained by the presence of a cold (in the sense of the low energy of the electrons in the frame of the moving plasma) ultrarelativistic wind dominated by kinetic energy. The conversion of the Poynting flux to kinetic energy should take place abruptly in the narrow cylindrical zone of radius between 20 and 50 light-cylinder radii centred on the axis of rotation of the pulsar, and should accelerate the wind to a Lorentz factor of (0.5-1.0) x 10(6). Although the ultrarelativistic nature of the wind does support the general model of pulsars, the requirement of the very high acceleration of the wind in a narrow zone not far from the light cylinder challenges current models.","[Aharonian, F.

The elasticity and high aspect ratios of the fibres allow deformation under capillary forces, which cause mechanical damage(8), matting(5,9) self-assembly(10,11) or colour changes(12), with many industrial and ecological consequences. Attempts to understand these systems have mostly focused on the wetting of rigid fibres(13-17) or on elastocapillary effects in planar geometries(18) and on a fibre brush withdrawn from an infinite bath(19). Here we consider the frequently encountered case of a liquid drop deposited on a flexible fibre array and show that flexibility, fibre geometry and drop volume are the crucial parameters that are necessary to understand the various observations referred to above. We identify the conditions required for a drop to remain compact with minimal spreading or to cause a pair of elastic fibres to coalesce. We find that there is a critical volume of liquid, and, hence, a critical drop size, above which this coalescence does not occur. We also identify a drop size that maximizes liquid capture. For both wetting and deformation of the substrates, we present rules that are deduced from the geometric and material properties of the fibres and the volume of the drop. These ideas are applicable to a wide range of fibrous materials, as we illustrate with examples for feathers, beetle tarsi, sprays and microfabricated systems.","[Duprat, C.; Beebe, A. Y.; Stone, H.

Most previous global mass balance estimates for GICs rely on extrapolation of sparse mass balance measurements(1,2,4) representing only a small fraction of the GIC area, leaving their overall contribution to sea level rise unclear. Here we show that GICs, excluding the Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs, lost mass at a rate of 148 +/- 30 Gt yr(-1) from January 2003 to December 2010, contributing 0.41 +/- 0.08 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise. Our results are based on a global, simultaneous inversion of monthly GRACE-derived satellite gravity fields, from which we calculate the mass change over all ice-covered regions greater in area than 100 km(2). The GIC rate for 2003-2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous mass balance estimate that most closely matches our study period(2). The high mountains of Asia, in particular, show a mass loss of only 4 +/- 20 Gt yr(-1) for 2003-2010, compared with 47-55 Gt yr(-1) in previously published estimates(2,5). For completeness, we also estimate that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, including their peripheral GICs, contributed 1.06 +/- 0.19 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise over the same time period. The total contribution to sea level rise from all ice-covered regions is thus 1.48 +/- 0.26 mm yr(-1), which agrees well with independent estimates of sea level rise originating from land ice loss and other terrestrial sources(6).","[Jacob, Thomas; Wahr, John] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jacob, Thomas; Wahr, John] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Environm Studies, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Pfeffer, W.

Ageing is one of the most prominent factors to influence disease onset and progression(1), yet little is known about the molecular pathways that connect these processes. To understand this connection it is necessary to identify the pathways that functionally integrate ageing, chronic maintenance of the brain and modulation of neurodegenerative disease. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are emerging as critical factors in gene regulation during development; however, their role in adult-onset, age-associated processes is only beginning to be revealed. Here we report that the conserved miRNA miR-34 regulates age-associated events and long-term brain integrity in Drosophila, providing a molecular link between ageing and neurodegeneration. Fly mir-34 expression exhibits adult-onset, brain-enriched and age-modulated characteristics. Whereas mir-34 loss triggers a gene profile of accelerated brain ageing, late-onset brain degeneration and a catastrophic decline in survival, mir-34 upregulation extends median lifespan and mitigates neurodegeneration induced by human pathogenic polyglutamine disease protein. Some of the age-associated effects of miR-34 require adult-onset translational repression of Eip74EF, an essential ETS domain transcription factor involved in steroid hormone pathways. Our studies indicate that miRNA-dependent pathways may have an impact on adult-onset, age-associated events by silencing developmental genes that later have a deleterious influence on adult life cycle and disease, and highlight fly miR-34 as a key miRNA with a role in this process.","[Liu, Nan; Landreh, Michael; Abe, Masashi; Hendriks, Gert-Jan; Kennerdell, Jason R.; Zhu, Yongqing; Bonini, Nancy M.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cao, Kajia; Wang, Li-San] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Li-San] Univ Penn, Inst Aging, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Li-San] Univ Penn, Penn Ctr Bioinformat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bonini, Nancy M.] Univ Penn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Bonini, NM (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nbonini@sas.upenn.edu,"Liu, Nan/D-8913-2011","Hendriks, Gerardus/0000-0001-8798-1443; Landreh, Michael/0000-0002-7958-4074","NINDS [R01-NS043578]; Ellison Foundation; Penn Genome Frontiers Institute; NIA [U01-AG-032984-02, RC2-AG036528-01]; Penn Institute on Aging [AG010124]; NIH [T32 AG00255]","We thank C.

However, the molecular pathways for the maintenance of stem-cell quiescence remain elusive. Here we use adult mouse muscle stem cells (satellite cells) as a model system and show that the microRNA (miRNA) pathway is essential for the maintenance of the quiescent state. Satellite cells that lack a functional miRNA pathway spontaneously exit quiescence and enter the cell cycle. We identified quiescence-specific miRNAs in the satellite-cell lineage by microarray analysis. Among these, miRNA-489 (miR-489) is highly expressed in quiescent satellite cells and is quickly downregulated during satellite-cell activation. Further analysis revealed that miR-489 functions as a regulator of satellite-cell quiescence, as it post-transcriptionally suppresses the oncogene Dek, the protein product of which localizes to the more differentiated daughter cell during asymmetric division of satellite cells and promotes the transient proliferative expansion of myogenic progenitors. Our results provide evidence of the miRNA pathway in general, and of a specific miRNA, miR-489, in actively maintaining the quiescent state of an adult stem-cell population.","[Cheung, Tom H.; Quach, Navaline L.; Charville, Gregory W.; Liu, Ling; Park, Lidia; Edalati, Abdolhossein; Yoo, Bryan; Hoang, Phuong; Rando, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Paul F Glenn Labs Biol Aging, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cheung, Tom H.; Quach, Navaline L.; Charville, Gregory W.; Liu, Ling; Park, Lidia; Edalati, Abdolhossein; Yoo, Bryan; Hoang, Phuong; Rando, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Charville, Gregory W.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rando, Thomas A.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Neurol Serv, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Rando, Thomas A.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Rehabil Res & Dev Ctr Excellence, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Rando, TA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Paul F Glenn Labs Biol Aging, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rando@stanford.edu,,,"Glenn Foundation for Medical Research; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P01 AG036695, R01 AG23806, R01 AR062185, DP1 OD000392]; Department of Veterans Affairs","We thank the members of the Rando laboratory for comments and discussions.

Dissemination, a marker of poor prognosis, is found in up to 40% of children at diagnosis and inmost children at the time of recurrence. Affected children therefore are treated with radiation to the entire developing brain and spinal cord, followed by high-dose chemotherapy, with the ensuing deleterious effects on the developing nervous system(2). The mechanisms of dissemination through the cerebrospinal fluid are poorly studied, and medulloblastoma metastases have been assumed to be biologically similar to the primary tumour(3,4). Here we show that in both mouse and human medulloblastoma, the metastases from an individual are extremely similar to each other but are divergent from the matched primary tumour. Clonal genetic events in the metastases can be demonstrated in a restricted subclone of the primary tumour, suggesting that only rare cells within the primary tumour have the ability to metastasize.

DCC gene expression is lost or markedly reduced in the majority of advanced colorectal cancers(1) and, by functioning as a dependence receptor, DCC has been shown to induce apoptosis unless engaged by its ligand, netrin-1 (ref. 2). However, so far no animal model has supported the view that the DCC loss-of-function is causally implicated as predisposing to aggressive cancer development(3). To investigate the role of DCC-induced apoptosis in the control of tumour progression, here we created a mouse model in which the pro-apoptotic activity of DCC is genetically silenced. Although the loss of DCC-induced apoptosis in this mouse model is not associated with a major disorganization of the intestines, it leads to spontaneous intestinal neoplasia at a relatively low frequency. Loss of DCC-induced apoptosis is also associated with an increase in the number and aggressiveness of intestinal tumours in a predisposing APC mutant context, resulting in the development of highly invasive adenocarcinomas. These results demonstrate that DCC functions as a tumour suppressor via its ability to trigger tumour cell apoptosis.","[Castets, Marie; Broutier, Laura; Molin, Yann; Chazot, Guillaume; Mazelin, Laetitia; Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Loraine; Bernet, Agnes; Mehlen, Patrick] Univ Lyon, Apoptosis Canc & Dev Lab, Ctr Leon Berard,Ctr Cancerol Lyon,INSERM,U1052, Equipe Labellise La Ligue,LabEX DEVweCAN,CNRS,UMR, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Brevet, Marie; Gadot, Nicolas; Paquet, Armelle; Scoazec, Jean-Yves] Univ Lyon, Hop Edouard Herriot, Endocrine Differentiat Lab,CNRS,UMR5286, Hosp Civils Lyon,Ctr Cancerol Lyon,INSERM,U1052, F-69437 Lyon, France","Mehlen, P (reprint author), Univ Lyon, Apoptosis Canc & Dev Lab, Ctr Leon Berard,Ctr Cancerol Lyon,INSERM,U1052, Equipe Labellise La Ligue,LabEX DEVweCAN,CNRS,UMR, F-69008 Lyon, France.",patrick.mehlen@lyon.unicancer.fr,,,Ligue Contre le Cancer; INCA; ANR; IP ApoSys; LabEX DEVweCAN [ANR-10-LABX-61],"We wish to thank D.

DCC belongs to the family of netrin 1 receptors, which function as dependence receptors as they control survival or apoptosis depending on ligand binding. However, the role of DCC as a tumour suppressor remains controversial because of the rarity of DCC-specific mutations and the presence of other tumour suppressor genes in the same chromosomal region. Here we show that in a mouse model of mammary carcinoma based on somatic inactivation of p53, additional loss of DCC promotes metastasis formation without affecting the primary tumour phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in cell cultures derived from p53-deficient mouse mammary tumours DCC expression controls netrin-1-dependent cell survival, providing a mechanistic basis for the enhanced metastatic capacity of tumour cells lacking DCC. Consistent with this idea, in vivo tumour-cell survival is enhanced by DCC loss. Together, our data support the function of DCC as a context-dependent tumour suppressor that limits survival of disseminated tumour cells.","[Krimpenfort, Paul; Proost, Natalie; Zevenhoven, John; Berns, Anton] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Genet, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jonkers, Jos] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Biol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jonkers, Jos] Netherlands Canc Inst, Ctr Biomed Genet, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Song, Ji-Ying] Netherlands Canc Inst, Dept Expt Anim Pathol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Berns, Anton] Netherlands Canc Inst, AMC, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Berns, A (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Genet, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.berns@nki.nl,,,,,,28,40,41,0,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Feb,2012,482,7386,,,,,538,U134,,10.1038/nature10790,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,898VM,WOS:000300770500053,22358843,No,,,11/20/17

Menin interacts with many proteins and is involved in a variety of cellular processes(2-8). Menin binds the JUN family transcription factor JUND and inhibits its transcriptional activity(2,9). Several MEN1 missense mutations disrupt the menin-JUND interaction, suggesting a correlation between the tumour-suppressor function of menin and its suppression of JUND-activated transcription(2,10). Menin also interacts with mixed lineage leukaemia protein 1 (MLL1), a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, and functions as an oncogenic cofactor to upregulate gene transcription and promote MLL1-fusion-protein-induced leukaemogenesis(5,7,11,12). A recent report on the tethering of MLL1 to chromatin binding factor lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) by menin indicates that menin is a molecular adaptor coordinating the functions of multiple proteins(13). Despite its importance, how menin interacts with many distinct partners and regulates their functions remains poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structures of human menin in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND, or with an MLL1-LEDGF heterodimer. These structures show that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects on transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct surface formed by both menin and MLL1.","[Huang, Jing; Wan, Bingbing; Wan, Ke; Lei, Ming] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Huang, Jing; Wan, Bingbing; Wan, Ke; Lei, Ming] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gurung, Buddha; Matkar, Smita; Hua, Xianxin] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Veniaminova, Natalia A.; Merchant, Juanita L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Merchant, Juanita L.] Univ Michigan, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lei, M (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1150 W Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",huax@mail.med.upenn.edu; leim@umich.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM 083015-01, R01-DK085121, R37-DK45729]; American Cancer Society; American Association for Cancer Research Caring for Carcinoid Foundation; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Science [Y1-GM-1104]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","We thank G.

Muscarinic receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate the response to acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves(1-5). Their role in the unconscious regulation of organ and central nervous system function makes them potential therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. The M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor) is essential for the physiological control of cardiovascular function through activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels, and is of particular interest because of its extensive pharmacological characterization with both orthosteric and allosteric ligands. Here we report the structure of the antagonist-bound human M2 receptor, the first human acetylcholine receptor to be characterized structurally, to our knowledge. The antagonist 3-quinuclidinyl-benzilate binds in the middle of a long aqueous channel extending approximately two-thirds through the membrane. The orthosteric binding pocket is formed by amino acids that are identical in all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, and shares structural homology with other functionally unrelated acetylcholine binding proteins from different species. A layer of tyrosine residues forms an aromatic cap restricting dissociation of the bound ligand. A binding site for allosteric ligands has been mapped to residues at the entrance to the binding pocket near this aromatic cap. The structure of the M2 receptor provides insights into the challenges of developing subtype-selective ligands for muscarinic receptors and their propensity for allosteric regulation.","[Kruse, Andrew C.; Zhang, Cheng; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Haga, Kazuko; Okada, Tetsuji; Haga, Tatsuya] Gakushuin Univ, Dept Life Sci, Fac Sci, Tokyo 1718588, Japan; [Asada, Hidetsugu; Yurugi-Kobayashi, Takami; Kobayashi, Takuya] Kyoto Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Chem & Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Asada, Hidetsugu; Yurugi-Kobayashi, Takami; Shiroishi, Mitsunori; Kobayashi, Takuya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Human Receptor Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Shiroishi, Mitsunori] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kobayashi, Takuya] Kyoto Univ, Fac Med, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Kobilka, BK (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, 279 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kobilka@stanford.edu; tatsuya.haga@gakushuin.ac.jp; t-coba@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Weis, William/G-1437-2011; Zhang, Cheng/O-4372-2015","Weis, William/0000-0002-5583-6150; Zhang, Cheng/0000-0001-9042-4007","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Science and Technology Corporation (CREST); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [15083201]; Japan Science and Technology Corporation (ERATO); Toray Science Foundation; Takeda Science Foundation; Ichiro Kanehara Foundation; Sumitomo Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, GM083118]; Mathers Foundation; National Science Foundation","We thank S.

Although the five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) share a high degree of sequence homology, they show pronounced differences in G-protein coupling preference and the physiological responses they mediate(2-4). Unfortunately, despite decades of effort, no therapeutic agents endowed with clear mAChR subtype selectivity have been developed to exploit these differences(5,6). We describe here the structure of the G(q/11)-coupled M3 mAChR ('M3 receptor', from rat) bound to the bronchodilator drug tiotropium and identify the binding mode for this clinically important drug. This structure, together with that of the G(i/o)-coupled M2 receptor(7), offers possibilities for the design of mAChR subtype-selective ligands. Importantly, the M3 receptor structure allows a structural comparison between two members of a mammalian GPCR subfamily displaying different G-protein coupling selectivities. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tiotropium binds transiently to an allosteric site en route to the binding pocket of both receptors. These simulations offer a structural view of an allosteric binding mode for an orthosteric GPCR ligand and provide additional opportunities for the design of ligands with different affinities or binding kinetics for different mAChR subtypes. Our findings not only offer insights into the structure and function of one of the most important GPCR families, but may also facilitate the design of improved therapeutics targeting these critical receptors.","[Kruse, Andrew C.; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hu, Jianxin; Rosemond, Erica; Liu, Tong; Wess, Juergen] NIDDK, Mol Signaling Sect, Bioorgan Chem Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Pan, Albert C.; Arlow, Daniel H.; Green, Hillary F.; Dror, Ron O.; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Rosenbaum, Daniel M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chae, Pil Seok] Hanyang Univ, Dept Bionano Engn, Ansan 426791, South Korea; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Kobilka, BK (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, 279 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jwess@helix.nih.gov; kobilka@stanford.edu,"Pan, Albert/G-1475-2013; Weis, William/G-1437-2011","Weis, William/0000-0002-5583-6150; Rosemond, Erica/0000-0002-9188-7713; Pan, Albert/0000-0001-5050-5603","National Institutes of Health [NS028471, GM56169]; Mathers Foundation; National Science Foundation; NIDDK, NIH, US Department of Health and Human Services","We acknowledge support from National Institutes of Health grants NS028471 (B.

To investigate the relative contribution of these processes, we analysed historical and contemporary data of replicate whitefish radiations from 17 pre-alpine European lakes and reconstructed changes in genetic species differentiation through time using historical samples. Here we provide evidence that species diversity evolved in response to ecological opportunity, and that eutrophication, by diminishing this opportunity, has driven extinctions through speciation reversal and demographic decline. Across the radiations, the magnitude of eutrophication explains the pattern of species loss and levels of genetic and functional distinctiveness among remaining species. We argue that extinction by speciation reversal may be more widespread than currently appreciated. Preventing such extinctions will require that conservation efforts not only target existing species but identify and protect the ecological and evolutionary processes that generate and maintain species.","[Vonlanthen, P.; Hudson, A.

Yeast prions might provide a mechanism for generating heritable phenotypic diversity that promotes survival in fluctuating environments and the evolution of new traits. However, this hypothesis is highly controversial. Prions that create new traits have not been found in wild strains, leading to the perception that they are rare 'diseases' of laboratory cultivation. Here we biochemically test approximately 700 wild strains of Saccharomyces for [PSI+] or [MOT3(+)], and find these prions in many. They conferred diverse phenotypes that were frequently beneficial under selective conditions. Simple meiotic re-assortment of the variation harboured within a strain readily fixed one such trait, making it robust and prion-independent. Finally, we genetically screened for unknown prion elements. Fully one-third of wild strains harboured them. These, too, created diverse, often beneficial phenotypes. Thus, prions broadly govern heritable traits in nature, in a manner that could profoundly expand adaptive opportunities.","[Halfmann, Randal; Jarosz, Daniel F.; Jones, Sandra K.; Chang, Amelia; Lancaster, Alex K.; Lindquist, Susan] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Halfmann, Randal; Chang, Amelia; Lindquist, Susan] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lindquist, Susan] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lindquist, S (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Lindquist_admin@wi.mit.edu,"Lancaster, Alex/K-2855-2013","Lancaster, Alex/0000-0002-0002-9263; Jarosz, Daniel/0000-0003-3497-5888; Halfmann, Randal/0000-0002-6592-1471",G.

It became the second-brightest star in our sky during its mid-nineteenth-century 'Great Eruption', but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates of brightness(3,4)). Its eruption is unique in that it exceeded the Eddington luminosity limit for ten years. Because it is only 2.3 kiloparsecs away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejected mass and velocity, indicating that during its nineteenth-century eruption, eta Car ejected more than ten solar masses in an event that released ten per cent of the energy of a typical core-collapse supernova(5,6), without destroying the star. Here we report observations of light echoes of eta Carinae from the 1838-1858 Great Eruption. Spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, which are blueshifted by -210 km s(-1), in good agreement with predicted expansion speeds(6). The light-echo spectra correlate best with those of G2-to-G5 supergiants, which have effective temperatures of around 5,000 kelvin. In contrast to the class of extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogues of the Great Eruption of eta Carinae(7-12), the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly lower than that allowed by standard opaque wind models(13). This indicates that other physical mechanisms such as an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.","[Rest, A.; Walborn, N. R.; Bond, H.

Magnetic reconnection involves localized diffusion of the magnetic field across plasma, yet observed reconnection rates are typically much higher than can be accounted for using classical electrical resistivity(10). It is generally proposed(10) that the field diffusion underlying fast reconnection results instead from some combination of non-magnetohydrodynamic processes that become important on the 'microscopic' scale of the ion Larmor radius or the ion skin depth. A recent laboratory experiment(11) demonstrated a transition from slow to fast magnetic reconnection when a current channel narrowed to a microscopic scale, but did not address how a macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic system accesses the microscale. Recent theoretical models(12) and numerical simulations(13,14) suggest that a macroscopic, two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic current sheet might do this through a sequence of repetitive tearing and thinning into two-dimensional magnetized plasma structures having successively finer scales. Here we report observations demonstrating a cascade of instabilities from a distinct, macroscopic-scale magnetohydrodynamic instability to a distinct, microscopic-scale (ion skin depth) instability associated with fast magnetic reconnection. These observations resolve the full three-dimensional dynamics and give insight into the frequently impulsive nature of reconnection in space and laboratory plasmas.","[Moser, Auna L.; Bellan, Paul M.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Moser, AL (reprint author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",auna@caltech.edu,,,US DOE; NSF; AFOSR,"This work supported by the US DOE, NSF and AFOSR.",,24,31,31,2,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Feb,2012,482,7385,,,,,379,381,,10.1038/nature10827,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,892LG,WOS:000300287100041,22337058,No,,,11/20/17

However, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence, by using quantum error correcting codes(1). The simplest of these are three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state; they can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error on one of the three qubits, depending on the code used(2). Here we demonstrate such phase-and bit-flip error correcting codes in a superconducting circuit. We encode a quantum state(3,4), induce errors on the qubits and decode the error syndrome-a quantum state indicating which error has occurred-by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate that corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate (known as a conditional-conditional NOT, or Toffoli, gate) in 63 nanoseconds, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit. We find 85 +/- 1 per cent fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate, and 78 +/- 1 per cent fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using this gate, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenation of these two codes in a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. In combination with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times(5,6), this could lead to scalable quantum technology.","[Reed, M. D.; Nigg, S. E.; Sun, L.; Frunzio, L.; Girvin, S.

Recent tomographic inversions based on the US Array data reveal unprecedented detail of upper-mantle structures of the western USA(9) and tightly constrain geodynamic models simulating Farallon subduction, which has been proposed to influence the Yellowstone volcanism(5,6). Here we show that the best-fitting geodynamic model(10) depicts an episode of slab tearing about 17 million years ago under eastern Oregon, where an associated sub-slab asthenospheric upwelling thermally erodes the Farallon slab, leading to formation of a slab gap at shallow depth. Driven by a gradient of dynamic pressure, the tear ruptured quickly north and south and within about two million years covering a distance of around 900 kilometres along all of eastern Oregon and northern Nevada. This tear would be consistent with the occurrence of major volcanic dikes during the SCR-Northern Nevada Rift flood basalt event both in space and time. The model predicts a petrogenetic sequence for the flood basalt with sources of melt starting from the base of the slab, at first remelting oceanic lithosphere and then evolving upwards, ending with remelting of oceanic crust. Such a progression helps to reconcile the existing controversies on the interpretation of SCR geochemistry and the involvement of the putative Yellowstone plume. Our study suggests a new mechanism for the formation of large igneous provinces.","[Liu, Lijun; Stegman, Dave R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, IGPP, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Liu, LJ (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, IGPP, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",lil019@ucsd.edu,"Liu, Lijun/C-2840-2012; Stegman, Dave/F-5794-2010","Stegman, Dave/0000-0001-8012-6145",XSEDE [EAR100021]; John Miles Fellowship; Cecil and Ida Green Foundation; G.

However, it remains difficult to identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels are also available(6-8). We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce genome-widemaps of chromatin accessibility for each individual. We identified 8,902 locations at which the DNase-seq read depth correlated significantly with genotype at a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion (false discovery rate = 10%). We call such variants 'DNase I sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription factor binding sites and are frequently associated with allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A substantial fraction (16%) of dsQTLs are also associated with variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is, these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we estimate that as many as 55% of eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation.","[Degner, Jacob F.; Pai, Athma A.; Pique-Regi, Roger; Veyrieras, Jean-Baptiste; Gaffney, Daniel J.; Pickrell, Joseph K.; Stephens, Matthew; Gilad, Yoav; Pritchard, Jonathan K.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Degner, Jacob F.] Univ Chicago, Comm Genet Genom & Syst Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Veyrieras, Jean-Baptiste] BioMiningLabs, F-69001 Lyon, France; [Gaffney, Daniel J.; De Leon, Sherryl; Michelini, Katelyn; Lewellen, Noah; Pritchard, Jonathan K.] Univ Chicago, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Crawford, Gregory E.] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Crawford, Gregory E.] Duke Univ, Div Med Genet, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Pritchard, JK (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gilad@uchicago.edu; pritch@uchicago.edu,"Pique-Regi, Roger/A-4110-2009","Pique-Regi, Roger/0000-0002-1262-2275; /0000-0002-7995-9948","National Institutes of Health [HG006123, MH084703, MH090951]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Chicago Fellows Program; American Heart Association","We thank members of the Pritchard, Przeworski, Stephens and Gilad laboratories for many helpful comments or discussions, and the ENCODE Project for publicly available ChIP-seq data.

Regulatory T (T-reg) cells prevent systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity and inflammatory lesions at mucosal interfaces. These cells are generated in the thymus (tT(reg) cells) and in the periphery (induced (i)T-reg cells), and their dual origin implies a division of labour between tT(reg) and iT(reg) cells in immune homeostasis. Here we show that a highly selective blockage in differentiation of iT(reg) cells in mice did not lead to unprovoked multi-organ autoimmunity, exacerbation of induced tissue-specific autoimmune pathology, or increased pro-inflammatory responses of T helper 1 (T(H)1) and T(H)17 cells. However, mice deficient in iT(reg) cells spontaneously developed pronounced T(H)2-type pathologies at mucosal sites-in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs-with hallmarks of allergic inflammation and asthma. Furthermore, iT(reg)-cell deficiency altered gut microbial communities. These results suggest that whereas T-reg cells generated in the thymus appear sufficient for control of systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity, extrathymic differentiation of T-reg cells affects commensal microbiota composition and serves a distinct, essential function in restraint of allergic-type inflammation at mucosal interfaces.","[Josefowicz, Steven Z.; Niec, Rachel E.; Chinen, Takatoshi; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Josefowicz, Steven Z.; Niec, Rachel E.; Chinen, Takatoshi; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Program Immunol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Josefowicz, Steven Z.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chromatin Biol & Epigenet, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kim, Hye Young; Umetsu, Dale T.] Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Treuting, Piper] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chinen, Takatoshi] Keio Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Sch Med, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Zheng, Ye] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Nomis Fdn Labs Immunobiol & Microbial Pathogenesi, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Rudensky, AY (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA.",rudenska@mskcc.org,"Zheng, Ye/G-4866-2015","Zheng, Ye/0000-0001-5012-4309; josefowicz, steven/0000-0001-7453-779X","NIH MSTP [GM07739]; NINDS [1F31NS073203-01]; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Keio University School of Medicine; NIH [R37 AI034206]","We thank T.

Although many immune components that participate in this process are known, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. A central tenet of cancer immunoediting is that T-cell recognition of tumour antigens drives the immunological destruction or sculpting of a developing cancer. However, our current understanding of tumour antigens comes largely from analyses of cancers that develop in immunocompetent hosts and thus may have already been edited. Little is known about the antigens expressed in nascent tumour cells, whether they are sufficient to induce protective antitumour immune responses or whether their expression is modulated by the immune system. Here, using massively parallel sequencing, we characterize expressed mutations in highly immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas derived from immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) mice that phenotypically resemble nascent primary tumour cells(1,3,5). Using class I prediction algorithms, we identify mutant spectrin-beta 2 as a potential rejection antigen of the d42m1 sarcoma and validate this prediction by conventional antigen expression cloning and detection. We also demonstrate that cancer immunoediting of d42m1 occurs via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process that promotes outgrowth of pre-existing tumour cell clones lacking highly antigenic mutant spectrin-beta 2 and other potential strong antigens. These results demonstrate that the strong immunogenicity of an unedited tumour can be ascribed to expression of highly antigenic mutant proteins and show that outgrowth of tumour cells that lack these strong antigens via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process represents one mechanism of cancer immunoediting.","[Matsushita, Hirokazu; Vesely, Matthew D.; Rickert, Charles G.; Arthur, Cora D.; White, J.

Carcinogen-induced mouse models of cancer have shown that primary tumour susceptibility is thereby enhanced in immune-compromised mice, whereas the capacity for such tumours to grow after transplantation into wild-type mice is reduced(2,3). However, many questions about the process of cancer immunoediting remain unanswered, in part because of the known antigenic complexity and heterogeneity of carcinogen-induced tumours(4). Here we adapted a genetically engineered, autochthonous mouse model of sarcomagenesis to investigate the process of cancer immunoediting. This system allows us to monitor the onset and growth of immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumours induced in situ that harbour identical genetic and histopathological characteristics. By comparing the development of such tumours in immune-competent mice with their development in mice with broad immunodeficiency or specific antigenic tolerance, we show that recognition of tumour-specific antigens by lymphocytes is critical for immunoediting against sarcomas. Furthermore, primary sarcomas were edited to become less immunogenic through the selective outgrowth of cells that were able to escape T lymphocyte attack. Loss of tumour antigen expression or presentation on major histocompatibility complex I was necessary and sufficient for this immunoediting process to occur. These results highlight the importance of tumour-specific-antigen expression in immune surveillance, and potentially, immunotherapy.","[DuPage, Michel; Mazumdar, Claire; Schmidt, Leah M.; Cheung, Ann F.; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [DuPage, Michel; Mazumdar, Claire; Schmidt, Leah M.; Cheung, Ann F.; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Jacks, T (reprint author), MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tjacks@mit.edu,"_, _/B-4995-2012",,NIH [1 U54 CA126515-01]; Cancer Center from National Cancer Institute [P30-CA14051]; John D.

It is unclear how single, sporadic mutant cells that have sustained oncogenic alterations evolve within a tightly regulated tissue environment. Here we investigated the effects of inducing oncogene expression in single cells in organotypic mammary acini as a model to elucidate the processes by which oncogenic alterations initiate clonal progression from organized epithelial environments. Sporadic cells induced to overexpress oncogenes that specifically perturb cell-cycle checkpoints (for example, E7 from human papilloma virus 16, and cyclin D1), deregulate Myc transcription or activate AKT signalling remained quiescent within growth-arrested acini. By contrast, single cells that overexpress ERBB2 initiated a cellular cascade involving cell translocation from the epithelial layer, as well as luminal outgrowth that is characteristic of neoplastic progression in early-stage epithelial tumours. In addition, ERBB2-mediated cell translocation to the lumen was found to depend on extracellular-regulated kinase and matrix metalloproteinase activities, and genetic alterations that perturb local cell-matrix adhesion drove cell translocation. We also provide evidence that luminal cell translocation may drive clonal selection by promoting either the death or the expansion of quiescent oncogene-expressing cells, depending on whether the pre-existing alterations allow anchorage-independent survival and growth. Our data show that the initial outgrowth of single oncogene-expressing cells from organized epithelial structures is a highly regulated process, and we propose that a cell translocation mechanism allows sporadic mutant cells to evade suppressive micro-environments and elicits clonal selection for survival and proliferative expansion outside the native niches of these cells.","[Leung, Cheuk T.; Brugge, Joan S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Brugge, JS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Joan_Brugge@hms.harvard.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [CA080111]; American Cancer Society,"We thank S.

Efficient pathogen engulfment is mediated by cargo-selecting autophagy adaptors that rely on unidentified pattern-recognition or danger receptors to label invading pathogens as autophagy cargo, typically by polyubiquitin coating(4-9). Here we show in human cells that galectin 8 (also known as LGALS8), a cytosolic lectin, is a danger receptor that restricts Salmonella proliferation. Galectin 8 monitors endosomal and lysosomal integrity and detects bacterial invasion by binding host glycans exposed on damaged Salmonella-containing vacuoles. By recruiting NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2), galectin 8 activates antibacterial autophagy. Galectin-8-dependent recruitment of NDP52 to Salmonella-containing vesicles is transient and followed by ubiquitin-dependent NDP52 recruitment. Because galectin 8 also detects sterile damage to endosomes or lysosomes, as well as invasion by Listeria or Shigella, we suggest that galectin 8 serves as a versatile receptor for vesicle-damaging pathogens. Our results illustrate how cells deploy the danger receptor galectin 8 to combat infection by monitoring endosomal and lysosomal integrity on the basis of the specific lack of complex carbohydrates in the cytosol.","[Thurston, Teresa L.

The formation of stomata, epidermal pores that facilitate gas exchange, is highly coordinated with other aspects of photosynthetic development. The signalling pathways controlling stomata development are not fully understood(1,2), although mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is known to have key roles. Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that brassinosteroid regulates stomatal development by activating the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) YDA (also known as YODA). Genetic analyses indicate that receptor kinase-mediated brassinosteroid signalling inhibits stomatal development through the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinase BIN2, and BIN2 acts upstream of YDA but downstream of the ERECTA family of receptor kinases. Complementary in vitro and in vivo assays show that BIN2 phosphorylates YDA to inhibit YDA phosphorylation of its substrate MKK4, and that activities of downstream MAPKs are reduced in brassinosteroid-deficient mutants but increased by treatment with either brassinosteroid or GSK3-kinase inhibitor. Our results indicate that brassinosteroid inhibits stomatal development by alleviating GSK3-mediated inhibition of this MAPK module, providing two key links; that of a plant MAPKKK to its upstream regulators and of brassinosteroid to a specific developmental output.","[Kim, Tae-Wuk; Wang, Zhi-Yong] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Tae-Wuk] Hanyang Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Michniewicz, Marta; Bergmann, Dominique C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wang, ZY (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",zywang24@stanford.edu,"Wang, Zhi-Yong/E-3810-2012","Wang, Zhi-Yong/0000-0003-4602-3390",National Institutes of Health [R01GM066258]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-08ER15973]; Herman Frasch Foundation,"We thank K.

A ubiquitous protein that is essential for this DNA template-directed repair is RecA(1). After resection of broken DNA to produce single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RecA assembles on this ssDNA into a filament with the unique capacity to search and find DNA sequences in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that are homologous to the ssDNA. This homology search is vital to recombinational DNA repair, and results in homologous pairing and exchange of DNA strands. Homologous pairing involves DNA sequence-specific target location by the RecA-ssDNA complex. Despite decades of study, the mechanism of this enigmatic search process remains unknown. RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, but ATP hydrolysis is not required for DNA pairing and strand exchange(2,3), eliminating active search processes. Using dual optical trapping to manipulate DNA, and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to image DNA pairing, we demonstrate that both the three-dimensional conformational state of the dsDNA target and the length of the homologous RecA-ssDNA filament have important roles in the homology search. We discovered that as the end-to-end distance of the target dsDNA molecule is increased, constraining the available three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the molecule, the rate of homologous pairing decreases. Conversely, when the length of the ssDNA in the nucleoprotein filament is increased, homology is found faster. We propose a model for the DNA homology search process termed 'intersegmental contact sampling', in which the intrinsic multivalent nature of the RecA nucleoprotein filament is used to search DNA sequence space within 3D domains of DNA, exploiting multiple weak contacts to rapidly search for homology.

This relationship determines our ability to predict phenotypes from genotypes and to understand how evolutionary forces shape variation within and between species. Previous efforts to dissect the genotype-phenotype map were based on incomplete genotypic information. Here, we describe the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a community resource for analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits. The DGRP consists of fully sequenced inbred lines derived from a natural population. Population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism in centromeric autosomal regions and the X chromosome, evidence for positive and negative selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. Many variants in novel genes, most at low frequency, are associated with quantitative traits and explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance. The DGRP facilitates genotype-phenotype mapping using the power of Drosophila genetics.","[Mackay, Trudy F.

Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders.","[Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Elinav, Eran; Jin, Chengcheng; Strowig, Till; Thaiss, Christoph A.; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Jin, Chengcheng] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Hao, Liming] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mehal, Wajahat Z.; Jurczak, Michael J.; Camporez, Joao-Paulo; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kau, Andrew L.; Gordon, Jeffrey I.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Kau, Andrew L.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Allergy & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Eisenbarth, Stephanie C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Shulman, Gerald I.; Flavell, Richard A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Hoffman, Hal M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, Rady Childrens Hosp San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",richard.flavell@yale.edu,"Camporez, Joao Paulo/B-9122-2015","Eisenbarth, Stephanie/0000-0002-1244-208X; Jurczak, Michael/0000-0002-6335-6915; Strowig, Till/0000-0003-0185-1459",Cancer Research Institute; Israel-US educational foundation; American Physicians for Medicine in Israel Foundation; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; VA Merit award; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; United States-Israel binational Foundation; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America;  [T32HL007974];  [K08A1085038];  [R01DK076674-01];  [R01 DK-40936];  [R24 DK-085638];  [P30 DK-45735];  [U24 DK-059635],"We thank E.

The proteasome regulatory particle, consisting of the lid and base subcomplexes, recognizes and processes polyubiquitinated substrates. Here we used electron microscopy and a new heterologous expression system for the lid to delineate the complete subunit architecture of the regulatory particle from yeast. Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate's path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination. We provide a structural basis for the ability of the proteasome to degrade a diverse set of substrates and thus regulate vital cellular processes.","[Estrin, Eric; Matyskiela, Mary E.; Bashore, Charlene; Martin, Andreas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lander, Gabriel C.; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nogales, Eva; Martin, Andreas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Martin, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",a.martin@berkeley.edu,,"Lander, Gabriel C./0000-0003-4921-1135",Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; American Cancer Society [121453-PF-11-178-01-TBE]; NSF; Searle Scholars Program; UC Berkeley MCB Department; NIH [R01-GM094497-01A1]; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH through the NCRR [RR017573],"We thank the members of the Martin and Nogales labs for helpful discussions, and G.

It is wreathed in an extraordinary neutral hydrogen (H I) complex, which includes rings, shells and a counter-rotating core, spanning similar to 90 kiloparsecs (kpc; refs 1, 4). NGC 4449 is relatively isolated(5), although an interaction with its nearest known companion-the galaxy DDO 125, some 40 kpc to the south-has been proposed as being responsible for the complexity of its HI structure(6). Here we report the presence of a dwarf galaxy companion to NGC 4449, namely NGC 4449B. This companion has a V-band absolute magnitude of -13.4 and a half-light radius of 2.7 kpc, with a full extent of around 8 kpc. It is in a transient stage of tidal disruption, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf(7) near the Milky Way. NGC 4449B exhibits a striking S-shaped morphology that has been predicted for disrupting galaxies(7,8) but has hitherto been seen only in a dissolving globular cluster(9). We also detect an additional arc or disk ripple embedded in a two-component stellar halo, including a component extending twice as far as previously known, to about 20 kpc from the galaxy's centre.","[Rich, R.

The size of an exoplanet can be determined when it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing a decrease in starlight proportional to its radius. The smallest exoplanet hitherto discovered(3) has a radius 1.42 times that of the Earth's radius (R-circle plus), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. Here we report the discovery of two planets, one Earth-sized (1.03 R-circle plus) and the other smaller than the Earth (0.87 R-circle plus), orbiting the star Kepler-20, which is already known to host three other, larger, transiting planets(4). The gravitational pull of the new planets on the parent star is too small to measure with current instrumentation. We apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood of the planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signals result from an eclipsing binary star. Theoretical considerations imply that these planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. The outer planet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.","[Fressin, Francois; Torres, Guillermo; Charbonneau, David; Ballard, Sarah; Desert, Jean-Michel; Dressing, Courtney D.; Holman, Matthew J.; Latham, David W.; Quinn, Samuel N.; Ragozzine, Darin; Sasselov, Dimitar D.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rowe, Jason F.; Borucki, William J.; Bryson, Stephen T.; Henze, Christopher E.; Howell, Steve B.; Koch, David G.; Lissauer, Jack J.; Barclay, Thomas; Still, Martin] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Rogers, Leslie A.; Seager, Sara] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Batalha, Natalie M.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Star & Planet Format, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ciardi, David R.] CALTECH, NASA Exoplanet Sci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Fabrycky, Daniel C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ford, Eric B.] Univ Florida, Dept Astron, Gainesville, FL 32111 USA; [Gautier, Thomas N., III] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Howard, Andrew; Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jenkins, Jon M.; Mullally, Fergal; Seader, Shawn E.; Twicken, Joseph D.; Thompson, Susan E.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, SETI Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Uddin, Kamal] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Orbital Sci Corp, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA","Fressin, F (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ffressin@cfa.harvard.edu,"Ragozzine, Darin/C-4926-2013","Ciardi, David/0000-0002-5741-3047; Fabrycky, Daniel/0000-0003-3750-0183; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666; Barclay, Thomas/0000-0001-7139-2724; Charbonneau, David/0000-0002-9003-484X; Dressing, Courtney/0000-0001-8189-0233",NASA's Science Mission Directorate,Kepler was competitively selected as the tenth Discovery mission.

Such manipulation has many applications, including nonlinear optics at the few-photon level(1-3), slow light(4,5), lasing without inversion(6-8) and optical quantum information processing(9,10). The critical underlying technique is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference between transitions in multilevel atoms(11-15) renders an opaque medium transparent near an atomic resonance. With the advent of high-brilliance, accelerator-driven light sources such as storage rings or X-ray lasers, it has become attractive to extend the techniques of optical quantum control to the X-ray regime(16,17). Here we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency in the regime of hard X-rays, using the 14.4-kiloelectronvolt nuclear resonance of the Mossbauer isotope iron-57 (a two-level system). We exploit cooperative emission from ensembles of the nuclei, which are embedded in a low-finesse cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation. The spatial modulation of the photonic density of states in a cavity mode leads to the coexistence of superradiant and subradiant states of nuclei, respectively located at an antinode and a node of the cavity field. This scheme causes the nuclei to behave as effective three-level systems, with two degenerate levels in the excited state (one of which can be considered metastable). The radiative coupling of the nuclear ensembles by the cavity field establishes the atomic coherence necessary for the cancellation of resonant absorption. Because this technique does not require atomic systems with a metastable level, electromagnetically induced transparency and its applications can be transferred to the regime of nuclear resonances, establishing the field of nuclear quantum optics.","[Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram] Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany","Rohlsberger, R (reprint author), Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany.",ralf.roehlsberger@desy.de,"Sahoo, Balaram/E-4828-2011; Wille, Hans-Christian/C-3881-2013; Rohlsberger, Ralf/J-4173-2013","Sahoo, Balaram/0000-0002-2050-4746; Rohlsberger, Ralf/0000-0001-6005-5183; Wille, Hans-Christian/0000-0003-0851-3831",,,,29,80,80,3,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Feb,2012,482,7384,,,,,199,203,,10.1038/nature10741,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,888HI,WOS:000299994100034,22318603,No,,,11/20/17

The generation of coherent radiation by subwavelength resonant structures has attracted considerable interest, not only as a means of exploring the QED effects that emerge at small volume, but also for its potential in applications ranging from on-chip optical communication to ultrahigh-resolution and high-throughput imaging, sensing and spectroscopy. One such strand of research is aimed at developing the 'ultimate' nanolaser: a scalable, low-threshold, efficient source of radiation that operates at room temperature and occupies a small volume on a chip(2). Different resonators have been proposed for the realization of such a nanolaser-microdisk(3) and photonic bandgap(4) resonators, and, more recently, metallic(5,6), metallodielectric(7-10) and plasmonic(11,12) resonators. But progress towards realizing the ultimate nanolaser has been hindered by the lack of a systematic approach to scaling down the size of the laser cavity without significantly increasing the threshold power required for lasing. Here we describe a family of coaxial nanostructured cavities that potentially solve the resonator scalability challenge by means of their geometry and metal composition. Using these coaxial nanocavities, we demonstrate the smallest room-temperature, continuous-wave telecommunications-frequency laser to date. In addition, by further modifying the design of these coaxial nanocavities, we achieve thresholdless lasing with a broadband gain medium. In addition to enabling laser applications, these nanoscale resonators should provide a powerful platform for the development of other QED devices and metamaterials in which atom-field interactions generate new functionalities(13,14).","[Khajavikhan, M.; Simic, A.; Katz, M.; Lee, J.

Here, by contrast, we develop an 'orthoversion'(5) model whereby a succeeding supercontinent forms 90 degrees away, within the great circle of subduction encircling its relict predecessor. A supercontinent aggregates over a mantle downwelling but then influences global-scale mantle convection to create an upwelling under the landmass(6). We calculate the minimum moment of inertia about which oscillatory true polar wander occurs owing to the prolate shape of the non-hydrostatic Earth(5,7). By fitting great circles to each supercontinent's true polar wander legacy, we determine that the arc distances between successive supercontinent centres (the axes of the respective minimum moments of inertia) are 88 degrees for Nuna to Rodinia and 87 degrees for Rodinia to Pangaea-as predicted by the orthoversion model. Supercontinent centres can be located back into Precambrian time, providing fixed points for the calculation of absolute palaeolongitude over billion-year timescales. Palaeogeographic reconstructions additionally constrained in palaeolongitude will provide increasingly accurate estimates of ancient plate motions and palaeobiogeographic affinities.","[Mitchell, Ross N.; Kilian, Taylor M.; Evans, David A.

So far, we know that intelligence differences show high stability from childhood to old age(3,4) and there are estimates of the genetic contribution to intelligence at different ages(5,6). However, attempts to discover whether genetic causes contribute to differences in cognitive ageing have been relatively uninformative(7-10). Here we provide an estimate of the genetic and environmental contributions to stability and change in intelligence across most of the human lifetime. We used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 1,940 unrelated individuals whose intelligence was measured in childhood (age 11 years) and again in old age (age 65, 70 or 79 years)(11,12). We use a statistical method that allows genetic (co)variance to be estimated from SNP data on unrelated individuals(13-17). We estimate that causal genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with common SNPs account for 0.24 of the variation in cognitive ability change from childhood to old age. Using bivariate analysis, we estimate a genetic correlation between intelligence at age 11 years and in old age of 0.62. These estimates, derived from rarely available data on lifetime cognitive measures, warrant the search for genetic causes of cognitive stability and change.","[Deary, Ian J.; Davies, Gail; Liewald, David; Luciano, Michelle; Lopez, Lorna M.; Gow, Alan J.; Corley, Janie; Redmond, Paul] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Psychol, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Deary, Ian J.; Davies, Gail; Harris, Sarah E.; Liewald, David; Luciano, Michelle; Lopez, Lorna M.; Gow, Alan J.; Porteous, David J.; Starr, John M.; Visscher, Peter M.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Cognit Ageing & Cognit Epidemiol, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Yang, Jian; Visscher, Peter M.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia; [Harris, Sarah E.; Tenesa, Albert; Porteous, David J.] Western Gen Hosp, Inst Genet & Mol Med, Med Genet Sect, Mol Med Ctr, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Midlothian, Scotland; [Tenesa, Albert; Rowe, Suzanne J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Vet Studies, Roslin Inst, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland; [McNeill, Geraldine; Whalley, Lawrence J.] Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Redmond, Paul] Univ Aberdeen, Rowett Inst Nutr & Hlth, Nutr & Epigenet Grp, Aberdeen AB21 9SB, Scotland; [Goddard, Michael E.] Australia & Victorian Dept Primary Ind, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia; [Goddard, Michael E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Food & Agr Syst, Parkville, Vic 3011, Australia; [Starr, John M.] Univ Edinburgh, Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Res Ctr, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Visscher, Peter M.] Univ Queensland, Diamantina Inst, Princess Alexandra Hosp, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Visscher, Peter M.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Deary, IJ (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Dept Psychol, 7 George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",i.deary@ed.ac.uk; peter.visscher@uq.edu.au,"; Haggarty, Paul/C-1696-2009; Lopez, Lorna/F-7265-2010; Porteous, David/C-7289-2013; Deary, Ian/C-6297-2009; Gow, Alan/A-6070-2009; Luciano, Michelle/F-7277-2010; Yang, Jian/A-5852-2010","Lopez, Lorna/0000-0002-0241-9783; Porteous, David/0000-0003-1249-6106; Gow, Alan/0000-0002-3320-4531; Luciano, Michelle/0000-0003-0935-7682; Yang, Jian/0000-0003-2001-2474; Goddard, Michael/0000-0001-9917-7946; Visscher, Peter/0000-0002-2143-8760",Australian Research Council; National Health and Medical Research Council; BBSRC; EPSRC; ESRC; MRC,"We thank the cohort participants who contributed to these studies.

It may be possible to overcome these challenges by reprogramming primary cells from patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we reprogrammed primary fibroblasts from two patients with familial Alzheimer's disease, both caused by a duplication of the amyloid-beta precursor protein gene(1) (APP; termed APP(Dp)), two with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (termed sAD1, sAD2) and two non-demented control individuals into iPSC lines. Neurons from differentiated cultures were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized. Purified cultures contained more than 90% neurons, clustered with fetal brain messenger RNA samples by microarray criteria, and could form functional synaptic contacts. Virtually all cells exhibited normal electrophysiological activity. Relative to controls, iPSC-derived, purified neurons from the two APP(Dp) patients and patient sAD2 exhibited significantly higher levels of the pathological markers amyloid-beta(1-40), phospho-tau(Thr 231) and active glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (aGSK-3 beta). Neurons from APP(Dp) and sAD2 patients also accumulated large RAB5-positive early endosomes compared to controls. Treatment of purified neurons with beta-secretase inhibitors, but not gamma-secretase inhibitors, caused significant reductions in phospho-Tau(Thr 231) and aGSK-3 beta levels. These results suggest a direct relationship between APP proteolytic processing, but not amyloid-beta, in GSK-3 beta activation and tau phosphorylation in human neurons. Additionally, we observed that neurons with the genome of one sAD patient exhibited the phenotypes seen in familial Alzheimer's disease samples. More generally, we demonstrate that iPSC technology can be used to observe phenotypes relevant to Alzheimer's disease, even though it can take decades for overt disease to manifest in patients.","[Israel, Mason A.; Yuan, Shauna H.; Reyna, Sol M.; Herrera, Cheryl; Goldstein, Lawrence S.

Transcription factors bind to enhancer elements and recruit coactivators and chromatin-modifying enzymes to facilitate transcription initiation(3,4). During differentiation a subset of these enhancers must be silenced, but the mechanisms underlying enhancer silencing are poorly understood. Here we show that the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; ref. 5), which demethylates histone H3 on Lys 4 or Lys 9 (H3K4/K9), is essential in decommissioning enhancers during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). LSD1 occupies enhancers of active genes that are critical for control of the state of ESCs. However, LSD1 is not essential for the maintenance of ESC identity. Instead, ESCs lacking LSD1 activity fail to differentiate fully, and ESC-specific enhancers fail to undergo the histone demethylation events associated with differentiation. At active enhancers, LSD1 is a component of the NuRD (nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase) complex, which contains additional subunits that are necessary for ESC differentiation. We propose that the LSD1-NuRD complex decommissions enhancers of the pluripotency program during differentiation, which is essential for the complete shutdown of the ESC gene expression program and the transition to new cell states.","[Whyte, Warren A.; Bilodeau, Steve; Orlando, David A.; Hoke, Heather A.; Frampton, Garrett M.; Young, Richard A.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Whyte, Warren A.; Hoke, Heather A.; Frampton, Garrett M.; Young, Richard A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Foster, Charles T.] Univ Munich, Adolf Butenandt Inst, Dept Mol Biol, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Foster, Charles T.; Cowley, Shaun M.] Univ Leicester, Dept Biochem, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England","Young, RA (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",young@wi.mit.edu,"Young, Richard/F-6495-2012","Young, Richard/0000-0001-8855-8647; Bilodeau, Steve/0000-0002-9799-3832; Frampton, Garrett/0000-0002-2361-2750","Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Medical Research Council; National Institutes of Health [HG002668, NS055923]","We thank J.

Mutations in ATRX (alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)(5) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres(6,7), were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation.

Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.","[Liu, Xiao-Yang; Jacob, Karine; Fontebasso, Adam M.; Quang, Dong-Anh Khuong; Faury, Damien; Majewski, Jacek; Jabado, Nada] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ H3Z 2Z3, Canada; [Liu, Xiao-Yang; Jacob, Karine; Fontebasso, Adam M.; Quang, Dong-Anh Khuong; Faury, Damien; Majewski, Jacek; Jabado, Nada] McGill Univ, Dept Expt Med, Montreal, PQ H3Z 2Z3, Canada; [Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Lepage, Pierre; Montpetit, Alexandre] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; [Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Lepage, Pierre; Montpetit, Alexandre] Genome Quebec Innovat Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; [Korshunov, Andrey; von Deimling, Andreas] German Canc Res Ctr, Clin Cooperat Unit Neuropathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Jones, David T.

Dyes and arsenical compounds that displayed selectivity against trypanosomes were central to this work(1,2), and the drugs that emerged remain in use for treating human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)(3). The importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying selective drug action and resistance for the development of improved HAT therapies has been recognized, but these mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here we use all five current HAT drugs for genome-scale RNA interference target sequencing (RIT-seq) screens in Trypanosoma brucei, revealing the transporters, organelles, enzymes and metabolic pathways that function to facilitate antitrypanosomal drug action. RIT-seq profiling identifies both known drug importers(4,5) and the only known prodrug activator(6), and links more than fifty additional genes to drug action. A bloodstream stage-specific invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG75) family mediates suramin uptake, and the AP1 adaptin complex, lysosomal proteases and major lysosomal transmembrane protein, as well as spermidine and N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, all contribute to suramin action. Further screens link ubiquinone availability to nitro-drug action, plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPases to pentamidine action, and trypanothione and several putative kinases to melarsoprol action. We also demonstrate a major role for aquaglyceroporins in pentamidine and melarsoprol cross-resistance. These advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antitrypanosomal drug efficacy and resistance will aid the rational design of new therapies and help to combat drug resistance, and provide unprecedented molecular insight into the mode of action of antitrypanosomal drugs.","[Alsford, Sam; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Horn, David] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Eckert, Sabine; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Turner, Daniel J.; Berriman, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Leung, Ka Fai; Field, Mark C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England","Horn, D (reprint author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",david.horn@lshtm.ac.uk,"Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro/L-9454-2016; Berriman, Matthew/A-7618-2011","Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro/0000-0003-0476-3139; Berriman, Matthew/0000-0002-9581-0377; Field, Mark/0000-0002-4866-2885; Horn, David/0000-0001-5173-9284; Glover, Lucy/0000-0001-7191-6890; Alsford, Sam/0000-0001-8621-4920","Wellcome Trust [093010/Z/10/Z, 085775/Z/08/Z, 090007/Z/09/Z]; Bloomsbury colleges PhD studentship","We thank J.

Conformational changes induced by extracellular ligands binding to G-protein-coupled receptors result in a cellular response through the activation of G proteins. The A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR) is responsible for regulating blood flow to the cardiac muscle and is important in the regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in the brain(14). Here we report the raising of a mouse monoclonal antibody against human A(2A)AR that prevents agonist but not antagonist binding to the extracellular ligand-binding pocket, and describe the structure of A(2A)AR in complex with the antibody Fab fragment (Fab2838). This structure reveals that Fab2838 recognizes the intracellular surface of A(2A)AR and that its complementarity-determining region, CDR-H3, penetrates into the receptor. CDR-H3 is located in a similar position to the G-protein carboxy-terminal fragment in the active opsin structure(1) and to CDR-3 of the nanobody in the active beta(2)-adrenergic receptor structure(2), but locks A(2A)AR in an inactive conformation.

Ion selectivity is generally considered an immutable property of the open channel structure, whereas gating involves transitions between open and closed channel states, typically without changes in ion selectivity(1). In store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, the molecular mechanism of channel gating by the CRAC channel activator, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), remains unknown. CRAC channels are distinguished by a very high Ca2+ selectivity and are instrumental in generating sustained intracellular calcium concentration elevations that are necessary for gene expression and effector function in many eukaryotic cells(2). Here we probe the central features of the STIM1 gating mechanism in the human CRAC channel protein, ORAI1, and identify V102, a residue located in the extracellular region of the pore, as a candidate for the channel gate. Mutations at V102 produce constitutively active CRAC channels that are open even in the absence of STIM1. Unexpectedly, although STIM1-free V102 mutant channels are not Ca2+-selective, their Ca2+ selectivity is dose-dependently boosted by interactions with STIM1. Similar enhancement of Ca2+ selectivity is also seen in wild-type ORAI1 channels by increasing the number of STIM1 activation domains that are directly tethered to ORAI1 channels, or by increasing the relative expression of full-length STIM1. Thus, exquisite Ca2+ selectivity is not an intrinsic property of CRAC channels but rather a tuneable feature that is bestowed on otherwise non-selective ORAI1 channels by STIM1. Our results demonstrate that STIM1-mediated gating of CRAC channels occurs through an unusual mechanism in which permeation and gating are closely coupled.","[McNally, Beth A.; Somasundaram, Agila; Yamashita, Megumi; Prakriya, Murali] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biol Chem, Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Prakriya, M (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biol Chem, Sch Med, 303 E Chicago Ave,Ward 8-296, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",m-prakriya@northwestern.edu,,,NIH [NS057499]; American Heart Association,"We thank C.

Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is a form of large-effect mutation that is able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions(2,6). Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stress could induce aneuploidy in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae). We show that whereas diverse stress conditions can induce an increase in chromosome instability, proteotoxic stress, caused by transient Hsp90 (also known as Hsp82 or Hsc82) inhibition or heat shock, markedly increased chromosome instability to produce a cell population with high karyotype diversity. The induced chromosome instability is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for the Hsp90 chaperone complex in kinetochore assembly(7,8). Continued growth in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drug-resistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes located on chromosome XV. Shortterm exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to unrelated cytotoxic compounds by means of different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable of fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress.","[Chen, Guangbo; Bradford, William D.; Seidel, Chris W.; Li, Rong] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Chen, Guangbo; Li, Rong] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Li, R (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, 1000 E 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",rli@stowers.org,,,National Institutes of Health [RO1GM059964],"We thank N.

Acetylation of many non-histone proteins involved in chromatin, metabolism or cytoskeleton regulation were further identified in eukaryotic organisms(2-6), but the corresponding enzymes and substrate-specific functions of the modifications are unclear. Moreover, mechanisms underlying functional specificity of individual KDACs(7) remain enigmatic, and the substrate spectra of each KDAC lack comprehensive definition. Here we dissect the functional specificity of 12 critical human KDACs using a genome-wide synthetic lethality screen(8-13) in cultured human cells. The genetic interaction profiles revealed enzyme-substrate relationships between individual KDACs and many important substrates governing a wide array of biological processes including metabolism, development and cell cycle progression. We further confirmed that acetylation and deacetylation of the catalytic subunit of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical cellular energy-sensing protein kinase complex, is controlled by the opposing catalytic activities of HDAC1 and p300. Deacetylation of AMPK enhances physical interaction with the upstream kinase LKB1, leading to AMPK phosphorylation and activation, and resulting in lipid breakdown in human liver cells. These findings provide new insights into previously underappreciated metabolic regulatory roles of HDAC1 in coordinating nutrient availability and cellular responses upstream of AMPK, and demonstrate the importance of high-throughput genetic interaction profiling to elucidate functional specificity and critical substrates of individual human KDACs potentially valuable for therapeutic applications.","[Lin, Yu-yi; Liu, Shang-Yun; Chou, Yi-hsuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Biochem & Mol Biol, Coll Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-yi; Lu, Jin-ying] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-yi] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Oncol, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Kiihl, Samara; Irizarry, Rafael] Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Suhail, Yasir; Bader, Joel S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Kuang, Zheng; Boeke, Jef D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kuang, Zheng; Boeke, Jef D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, High Throughput Biol Ctr, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Lu, Jin-ying] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Khor, Chin Ni; Lin, Chi-Long] Acad Sinica, Inst Mol Biol, Natl RNAi Core Facil, Taipei 115, Taiwan","Lin, YY (reprint author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Biochem & Mol Biol, Coll Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",yuyilin@ntu.edu.tw; jboeke1@jhmi.edu,"Bader, Joel/A-1818-2009","Bader, Joel/0000-0002-6020-4625","National Science Council [NSC 98-2320-B-002-057-, NSC 99-2320-B-002-057-, NSC 100-2325-002-044]; National Taiwan University Frontier and Innovative Research [99R71424]; National Taiwan University College of Medicine; National Taiwan University Hospital Excellent Translational Medicine Research [99C101-603]; National Health Research Institutes [NHRI-EX100-10017BC]; Liver Disease Prevention and Treatment Research Foundation; NIH [U54 RR 020839]","We thank H.

Yet the precise mechanisms that underlie plasticity there and ensure their specificity remain elusive. In locusts, the synapses between the intrinsic mushroom body neurons and their postsynaptic targets obey a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. Although this property homeostatically regulates the timing of mushroom body output, its potential role in associative learning is unknown. Here we show in vivo that pre-post pairing causing STDP can, when followed by the local delivery of a reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator, specify the synapses that will undergo an associative change. At these synapses, and there only, the change is a transformation of the STDP rule itself. These results illustrate the multiple actions of STDP, including a role in associative learning, despite potential temporal dissociation between the pairings that specify synaptic modification and the delivery of reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator signals.","[Cassenaer, Stijn; Laurent, Gilles] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cassenaer, Stijn] CALTECH, Broad Fellows Program Brain Circuitry, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Laurent, Gilles] Max Planck Inst Brain Res, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany","Laurent, G (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",stijn@caltech.edu; gilles.laurent@brain.mpg.de,"Laurent, Gilles/A-4583-2012",,"Lawrence Hanson Chair at Caltech; National Institutes on Deafness and other Communication Disorders; Caltech; Office of Naval Research [N00014-07-1-0741, N00014-10-1-0735]; Max Planck Society","This work was funded by the Lawrence Hanson Chair at Caltech, the National Institutes on Deafness and other Communication Disorders, Caltech's Broad Fellows Program, the Office of Naval Research (grants N00014-07-1-0741 and N00014-10-1-0735) and the Max Planck Society.

Here we identify a mechanism by which errors in mitotic chromosome segregation generate DNA breaks via the formation of structures called micronuclei. Whole-chromosome-containing micronuclei form when mitotic errors produce lagging chromosomes. We tracked the fate of newly generated micronuclei and found that they undergo defective and asynchronous DNA replication, resulting in DNA damage and often extensive fragmentation of the chromosome in the micronucleus. Micronuclei can persist in cells over several generations but the chromosome in the micronucleus can also be distributed to daughter nuclei. Thus, chromosome segregation errors potentially lead to mutations and chromosome rearrangements that can integrate into the genome. Pulverization of chromosomes in micronuclei may also be one explanation for 'chromothripsis' in cancer and developmental disorders, where isolated chromosomes or chromosome arms undergo massive local DNA breakage and rearrangement.","[Crasta, Karen; Ganem, Neil J.; Dagher, Regina; Lantermann, Alexandra B.; Nezi, Luigi; Pellman, David] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Crasta, Karen; Ganem, Neil J.; Dagher, Regina; Pellman, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Crasta, Karen; Ganem, Neil J.; Dagher, Regina; Pellman, David] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ivanova, Elena V.; Protopopov, Alexei] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pan, Yunfeng; Chowdhury, Dipanjan] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Pellman, D (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,"Crasta, Karen/F-8752-2015",,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH [GM083299, 1R01CA142698-01]","We thank A.

Its thermodynamic and transport properties are challenging to measure, requiring the creation of sufficiently long-lived samples at homogeneous temperatures and densities(5,6). With the advent of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser(7), high-intensity radiation (>10(17) watts per cm(2), previously the domain of optical lasers) can be produced at X-ray wavelengths. The interaction of single atoms with such intense X-rays has recently been investigated(8). An understanding of the contrasting case of intense X-ray interaction with dense systems is important from a fundamental viewpoint and for applications. Here we report the experimental creation of a solid-density plasma at temperatures in excess of 10(6) kelvin on inertial-confinement time-scales using an X-ray free-electron laser. We discuss the pertinent physics of the intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution of the system, the electron density and temperature, and the time-scales of collisional processes. Our results should inform future high-intensity X-ray experiments involving dense samples, such as X-ray diffractive imaging of biological systems, material science investigations, and the study of matter in extreme conditions.","[Vinko, S.

A route to controlling the quantum states of macroscopic mechanical oscillators in a similar fashion is to exploit the parametric coupling between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom through radiation pressure in suitably engineered optical cavities(3-6). If the optomechanical coupling is 'quantum coherent'-that is, if the coherent coupling rate exceeds both the optical and the mechanical decoherence rate-quantum states are transferred from the optical field to the mechanical oscillator and vice versa. This transfer allows control of the mechanical oscillator state using the wide range of available quantum optical techniques. So far, however, quantum-coherent coupling of micromechanical oscillators has only been achieved using microwave fields at millikelvin temperatures(7,8). Optical experiments have not attained this regime owing to the large mechanical decoherence rates(9) and the difficulty of overcoming optical dissipation(10). Here we achieve quantum-coherent coupling between optical photons and a micromechanical oscillator. Simultaneously, coupling to the cold photon bath cools the mechanical oscillator to an average occupancy of 1.7 +/- 0.1 motional quanta. Excitation with weak classical light pulses reveals the exchange of energy between the optical light field and the micromechanical oscillator in the time domain at the level of less than one quantum on average. This optomechanical system establishes an efficient quantum interface between mechanical oscillators and optical photons, which can provide decoherence-free transport of quantum states through optical fibres. Our results offer a route towards the use of mechanical oscillators as quantum transducers or in microwave-to-optical quantum links(11-15).","[Verhagen, E.; Deleglise, S.; Weis, S.; Schliesser, A.; Kippenberg, T.

A further advance in frequency comb technology is the generation of frequency combs in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range by means of high-harmonic generation in a femtosecond enhancement cavity(3,4). Until now, combs produced by this method have lacked sufficient power for applications, a drawback that has also hampered efforts to observe phase coherence of the high-repetition-rate pulse train produced by high-harmonic generation, which is an extremely nonlinear process. Here we report the generation of extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs, reaching wavelengths of 40 nanometres, by coupling a high-power near-infrared frequency comb(5) to a robust femtosecond enhancement cavity. These combs are powerful enough for us to observe single-photon spectroscopy signals for both an argon transition at 82 nanometres and a neon transition at 63 nanometres, thus confirming the combs' coherence in the extreme ultraviolet. The absolute frequency of the argon transition has been determined by direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The resolved ten-megahertz linewidth of the transition, which is limited by the temperature of the argon atoms, is unprecedented in this spectral region and places a stringent upper limit on the linewidth of individual comb teeth. Owing to the lack of continuous-wave lasers, extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs are at present the only promising route to extending ultrahigh-precision spectroscopy to the spectral region below 100 nanometres. At such wavelengths there is a wide range of applications, including the spectroscopy of electronic transitions in molecules(6), experimental tests of bound-state and many-body quantum electrodynamics in singly ionized helium and neutral helium(7-9), the development of next-generation 'nuclear' clocks(10-12) and searches for variation of fundamental constants(13) using the enhanced sensitivity of highly charged ions(14).","[Cingoez, Arman; Yost, Dylan C.; Allison, Thomas K.; Ye, Jun] Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Joint Inst Lab Astrophys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cingoez, Arman; Yost, Dylan C.; Allison, Thomas K.; Ye, Jun] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Ruehl, Axel; Fermann, Martin E.; Hartl, Ingmar] IMRA Amer Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Cingoz, A (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Joint Inst Lab Astrophys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",acingoz@jila.colorado.edu; junye@jila.colorado.edu,"Ye, Jun/C-3312-2011",,DARPA; AFOSR; NIST; NSF; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Germany),"We thank J.

Particularly intriguing are spider silks, with studies having explored properties ranging from their protein sequence(6) to the geometry of a web(7). This material system(8), highly adapted to meet a spider's many needs, has superior mechanical properties(9-15). In spite of much research into the molecular design underpinning the outstanding performance of silk fibres(1,6,10,13,16,17), and into the mechanical characteristics of web-like structures(18-21), it remains unknown how the mechanical characteristics of spider silk contribute to the integrity and performance of a spider web. Here we report web deformation experiments and simulations that identify the nonlinear response of silk threads to stress-involving softening at a yield point and substantial stiffening at large strain until failure-as being crucial to localize load-induced deformation and resulting in mechanically robust spider webs. Control simulations confirmed that a nonlinear stress response results in superior resistance to structural defects in the web compared to linear elastic or elastic-plastic (softening) material behaviour. We also show that under distributed loads, such as those exerted by wind, the stiff behaviour of silk under small deformation, before the yield point, is essential in maintaining the web's structural integrity. The superior performance of silk in webs is therefore not due merely to its exceptional ultimate strength and strain, but arises from the nonlinear response of silk threads to strain and their geometrical arrangement in a web.","[Cranford, Steven W.; Tarakanova, Anna; Buehler, Markus J.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, LAMM, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cranford, Steven W.; Tarakanova, Anna; Buehler, Markus J.] MIT, Ctr Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tarakanova, Anna] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Pugno, Nicola M.] Politecn Torino, Dept Struct Engn & Geotech, Lab Bioinspired Nanomech Giuseppe Maria Pugno, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Buehler, Markus J.] MIT, Ctr Computat Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Buehler, MJ (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, LAMM, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mbuehler@mit.edu,"Buehler, Markus/C-4580-2008; Cranford, Steven/H-4260-2012; Pugno, Nicola/C-2289-2014","Buehler, Markus/0000-0002-4173-9659; ","Office of Naval Research [N000141010562]; Army Research Office [W911NF-09-1-0541, W911NF-10-1-0127]; MIT-Italy (MITOR); Robert A.

Because no such eruption has been monitored during its long build-up phase, the precursor phenomena are not well understood. Geophysical signals obtained during recent episodes of unrest at calderas such as Yellowstone, USA, and Campi Flegrei, Italy, are difficult to interpret, and the conditions necessary for large eruptions are poorly constrained(2,3). Here we present a study of pre-eruptive magmatic processes and their timescales using chemically zoned crystals from the 'Minoan' caldera-forming eruption of Santorini volcano, Greece(4), which occurred in the late 1600s BC. The results provide insights into how rapidly large silicic systems may pass from a quiescent state to one on the edge of eruption(5,6). Despite the large volume of erupted magma(4) (40-60 cubic kilometres), and the 18,000-year gestation period between the Minoan eruption and the previous major eruption, most crystals in the Minoan magma record processes that occurred less than about 100 years before the eruption. Recharge of the magma reservoir by large volumes of silicic magma (and some mafic magma) occurred during the century before eruption, and mixing between different silicic magma batches was still taking place during the final months. Final assembly of large silicic magma reservoirs may occur on timescales that are geologically very short by comparison with the preceding repose period, with major growth phases immediately before eruption. These observations have implications for the monitoring of long-dormant, but potentially active, caldera systems.","[Druitt, T.

It is also referred to as 'lineback' or 'witrik' (which means white back), as colour-sided animals typically display a white band along their spine. Colour sidedness is documented at least since the Middle Ages and is presently segregating in several cattle breeds around the globe, including in Belgian blue and brown Swiss(1,2). Here we report that colour sidedness is determined by a first allele on chromosome 29 (Cs(29)), which results from the translocation of a 492-kilobase chromosome 6 segment encompassing KIT to chromosome 29, and a second allele on chromosome 6 (Cs(6)), derived from the first by repatriation of fused 575-kilobase chromosome 6 and 29 sequences to the KIT locus. We provide evidence that both translocation events involved circular intermediates.

Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) signal the discrepancy between expected and actual rewards (that is, reward prediction error)(1-3), but how they compute such signals is unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice associated different odour cues with appetitive and aversive outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31%) or negatively (type III, 18%) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged' dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons were of type II.

Protection against acquisition of infection showed distinct immunological correlates compared with post-infection virological control and required the inclusion of Env in the vaccine regimen.

In plants, an analogous period of prolonged maternal control over embryogenesis is thought to occur based on some gene-expression studies(2-6). However, other gene-expression studies and genetic analyses show that some transcripts must derive from the early zygotic genome(7-14), implying that the prevailing model does not fully explain the nature of zygotic genome activation in plants. To determine the maternal, paternal and zygotic contributions to the early embryonic transcriptome, we sequenced the transcripts of hybrid embryos from crosses between two polymorphic inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and used single-nucleotide polymorphisms diagnostic of each parental line to quantify parental contributions. Although some transcripts seemed to be either inherited from primarily one parent or transcribed from imprinted loci, the vast majority of transcripts were produced in near-equal amounts from both maternal and paternal alleles, even during the initial stages of embryogenesis. Results of reporter experiments and analyses of transcripts from genes that are not expressed in sperm and egg indicate early and widespread zygotic transcription. Thus, in contrast to early animal embryogenesis, early plant embryogenesis is mostly under zygotic control.","[Nodine, Michael D.; Bartel, David P.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Nodine, Michael D.; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Nodine, Michael D.; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Bartel, DP (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",dbartel@wi.mit.edu,"Nodine, Michael/D-3897-2014","Nodine, Michael/0000-0002-6204-8857","NIH [GM067031, GM084656]",We thank J.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a rare Mendelian syndrome featuring hypertension, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis, has revealed previously unrecognized physiology orchestrating the balance between renal salt reabsorption and K(+) and H(+) excretion(1). Here we used exome sequencing to identify mutations in kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) or cullin 3 (CUL3) in PHAII patients from 41 unrelated families. KLHL3 mutations are either recessive or dominant, whereas CUL3 mutations are dominant and predominantly de novo. CUL3 and BTB-domain-containing kelch proteins such as KLHL3 are components of cullin-RING E3 ligase complexes that ubiquitinate substrates bound to kelch propeller domains(2-8). Dominant KLHL3 mutations are clustered in short segments within the kelch propeller and BTB domains implicated in substrate(9) and cullin(5) binding, respectively. Diverse CUL3 mutations all result in skipping of exon 9, producing an in-frame deletion. Because dominant KLHL3 and CUL3 mutations both phenocopy recessive loss-of-function KLHL3 mutations, they may abrogate ubiquitination of KLHL3 substrates. Disease features are reversed by thiazide diuretics, which inhibit the Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal nephron of the kidney; KLHL3 and CUL3 are expressed in this location, suggesting a mechanistic link between KLHL3 and CUL3 mutations, increased Na-Cl reabsorption, and disease pathogenesis. These findings demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing in disease gene identification despite the combined complexities of locus heterogeneity, mixed models of transmission and frequent de novo mutation, and establish a fundamental role for KLHL3 and CUL3 in blood pressure, K(+) and pH homeostasis.","[Boyden, Lynn M.; Choi, Murim; Nelson-Williams, Carol J.; Farhi, Anita] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Boyden, Lynn M.; Choi, Murim; Nelson-Williams, Carol J.; Farhi, Anita] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Choate, Keith A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Toka, Hakan R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Renal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tikhonova, Irina R.; Bjornson, Robert; Mane, Shrikant M.] Yale Univ, Yale Ctr Genome Anal, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Colussi, Giacomo; De Ferrari, Maria E.] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Nephrol Unit, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Lebel, Marcel] Univ Laval, Dept Med, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Gordon, Richard D.] Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Endocrine Hypertens Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia; [Semmekrot, Ben A.] Canisius Wilhelmina Hosp, Dept Pediat, NL-6500 GS Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Poujol, Alain] Pays Aix Hosp, Dept Pediat, F-13616 Aix En Provence, France; [Valimaki, Matti J.] Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, FIN-00290 Helsinki, Finland; [Sanjad, Sami A.] American Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat & Adolescent Med, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Gutkin, Michael] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Hypertens Res Ctr, Newark, NJ 07103 USA; [Karet, Fiona E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Med Genet, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Tucci, Joseph R.] Roger Williams Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Providence, RI 02908 USA; [Stockigt, Jim R.] Alfred Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet, Ewen Downie Metab Unit, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Keppler-Noreuil, Kim M.] Univ Iowa, Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Div Med Genet, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Porter, Craig C.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Pediat, Div Nephrol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Anand, Sudhir K.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Whiteford, Margo L.] Royal Hosp Sick Children, Duncan Guthrie Inst Med Genet, Glasgow G3 8SJ, Lanark, Scotland; [Davis, Ira D.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, McGaw Pk, IL 60085 USA; [Dewar, Stephanie B.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Bettinelli, Alberto] Mandic Hosp, Div Pediat, I-23807 Merate, Italy; [Fadrowski, Jeffrey J.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Belsha, Craig W.] St Louis Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pediat, Div Nephrol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Hunley, Tracy E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Med Ctr, Div Nephrol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Nelson, Raoul D.] Univ Utah, Dept Pediat, Div Nephrol, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Trachtman, Howard] Cohen Childrens Med Ctr New York, Div Nephrol, New Hyde Pk, NY 11040 USA; [Cole, Trevor R.

Auxin perception directly triggers the degradation of Aux/IAA repressor proteins(2-6). Here we describe a novel Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor termed DII-VENUS that was engineered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The VENUS fast maturing form of yellow fluorescent protein(7) was fused in-frame to the Aux/IAA auxin-interaction domain (termed domain II; DII)(5) and expressed under a constitutive promoter. We initially show that DII-VENUS abundance is dependent on auxin, its TIR1/AFBs co-receptors(4-6,8) and proteasome activities. Next, we demonstrate that DII-VENUS provides a map of relative auxin distribution at cellular resolution in different tissues. DII-VENUS is also rapidly degraded in response to auxin and we used it to visualize dynamic changes in cellular auxin distribution successfully during two developmental responses, the root gravitropic response and lateral organ production at the shoot apex. Our results illustrate the value of developing response input sensors such as DII-VENUS to provide high-resolution spatio-temporal information about hormone distribution and response during plant growth and development.","[Brunoud, Geraldine; Oliva, Marina; Mirabet, Vincent; Traas, Jan; Vernoux, Teva] Univ Lyon, Lab Reprod & Dev Plantes, UCBL, ENS Lyon,INRA,CNRS, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Wells, Darren M.; Larrieu, Antoine; Bennett, Malcolm J.] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Plant Integrat Biol, Loughborough LE12 5RD, England; [Larrieu, Antoine; Beeckman, Tom] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Burrow, Amy H.; Kepinski, Stefan] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Ctr Plant Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Vernoux, T (reprint author), Univ Lyon, Lab Reprod & Dev Plantes, UCBL, ENS Lyon,INRA,CNRS, F-69364 Lyon, France.",teva.vernoux@ens-lyon.fr,"Larrieu, Antoine/O-9558-2017","Larrieu, Antoine/0000-0002-9024-5348; Vernoux, Teva/0000-0002-8257-4088; Beeckman, Tom/0000-0001-8656-2060; Wells, Darren/0000-0002-4246-4909","Human Frontier Science Program Organization [CDA 0047/2007 HFSPO]; Agence National de la Recherche [ANR-07-JCJC-0115, EraSysBio+ iSAM]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/F013981/1, BB/F007418/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","We thank A.

In mammalian cells, adenylylation of small GTPases through Fic proteins injected by pathogenic bacteria can cause collapse of the actin cytoskeleton and cell death(1,2). It is unknown how this potentially deleterious adenylylation activity is regulated in the widespread Fic proteins that are found in all domains of life and that are thought to have critical roles in intrinsic signalling processes. Here we show that FIC-domain-mediated adenylylation is controlled by a conserved mechanism of ATP-binding-site obstruction that involves an inhibitory alpha-helix (alpha(inh)) with a conserved (S/T)XXXE(G/N) motif, and that in this mechanism the invariable glutamate competes with ATP gamma-phosphate binding. Consistent with this, FIC-domain-mediated growth arrest of bacteria by the VbhT toxin of Bartonella schoen-buchensis is intermolecularly repressed by the VbhA antitoxin through tight binding of its alpha(inh) to the FIC domain of VbhT, as shown by structure and function analysis. Furthermore, structural comparisons with other bacterial Fic proteins, such as Fic of Neisseria meningitidis and of Shewanella oneidensis, show that alpha(inh) frequently constitutes an amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal extension to the FIC domain, respectively, partially obstructing the ATP binding site in an intramolecular manner. After mutation of the inhibitory motif in various Fic proteins, including the human homologue FICD (also known as HYPE), adenylylation activity is considerably boosted, consistent with the anticipated relief of inhibition. Structural homology modelling of all annotated Fic proteins indicates that inhibition by alpha(inh) is universal and conserved through evolution, as the inhibitory motif is present in similar to 90% of all putatively adenylylation-active FIC domains, including examples from all domains of life and from viruses. Future studies should reveal how intrinsic or extrinsic factors modulate adenylylation activity by weakening the interaction of alpha(inh) with the FIC active site.","[Goepfert, Arnaud; Stanger, Frederic V.; Schirmer, Tilman; Dehio, Christoph] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Core Program Struct Biol & Biophys, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Alexander] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Prote Core Facil, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Dehio, C (reprint author), Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Core Program Struct Biol & Biophys, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",Tilman.Schirmer@unibas.ch; Christoph.Dehio@unibas.ch,"Engel, Philipp/N-1788-2015; Dehio, Christoph/R-8277-2016","Engel, Philipp/0000-0002-4678-6200; Dehio, Christoph/0000-0001-7288-1052; Stanger, Frederic/0000-0002-9847-5084; Harms, Alexander/0000-0003-2106-1286","Swiss National Science Foundation [3100-061777, 3100-138414]; SystemsX.ch Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology [51RT 0_126008 (InfectX)]","We thank T.

Receptor desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors involves uncoupling of the receptor from its G-protein or second-messenger pathway followed by receptor internalization(1). G-protein-coupled cysteinyl leukotriene type I (CysLT1) receptors regulate immune-cell function and CysLT1 receptors are an established therapeutic target for allergies, including asthma(2). Desensitization of CysLT1 receptors arises predominantly from protein-kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of three serine residues in the receptor carboxy terminus(3). Physiological concentrations of the receptor agonist leukotriene C-4 (LTC4) evoke repetitive cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations, reflecting regenerative Ca2+ release from stores, which is sustained by Ca2+ entry through store-operated calcium-release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels(4). CRAC channels are tightly linked to expression of the transcription factor c-fos(5), a regulator of numerous genes important to cell growth and development(6). Here we show that abolishing leukotriene receptor desensitization suppresses agonist-driven gene expression in a rat cell line. Mechanistically, stimulation of non-desensitizing receptors evoked prolonged inositol-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release, which led to accelerated Ca2+-dependent slow inactivation of CRAC channels and a subsequent loss of excitation-transcription coupling. Hence, rather than serving to turn off a biological response, reversible desensitization of a Ca2+ mobilizing receptor acts as an 'on' switch, sustaining long-term signalling in the immune system.","[Ng, Siaw-Wei; Bakowski, Daniel; Nelson, Charmaine; Mehta, Ravi; Parekh, Anant B.] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; [Almeyda, Robert; Bates, Grant] John Radcliffe Hosp, Dept Ear Nose Throat Surg, Oxford OX3 9DH, England","Parekh, AB (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PT, England.",anant.parekh@dpag.ox.ac.uk,,"Mehta, Ravi/0000-0001-8211-1721",Medical Research Council; BBSRC-Glaxo-Smith-Kline,This work was supported by Medical Research Council grant support to A.

As prostate cancer cells proliferate in response to androgen steroids(2,3), CYP17A1 inhibition is a new strategy to prevent androgen synthesis and treat lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(4), but drug development has been hampered by lack of information regarding the structure of CYP17A1. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of CYP17A1, which were obtained in the presence of either abiraterone, a first-in-class steroidal inhibitor recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for late-stage prostate cancer(5), or TOK-001, an inhibitor that is currently undergoing clinical trials(4,6). Both of these inhibitors bind the haem iron, forming a 60 degrees angle above the haem plane and packing against the central I helix with the 3 beta-OH interacting with aspargine 202 in the F helix. Notably, this binding mode differs substantially from those that are predicted by homology models and from steroids in other cytochrome P450 enzymes with known structures, and some features of this binding mode are more similar to steroid receptors. Whereas the overall structure of CYP17A1 provides a rationale for understanding many mutations that are found in patients with steroidogenic diseases, the active site reveals multiple steric and hydrogen bonding features that will facilitate a better understanding of the enzyme's dual hydroxylase and lyase catalytic capabilities and assist in rational drug design. Specifically, structure-based design is expected to aid development of inhibitors that bind only CYP17A1 and solely inhibit its androgen-generating lyase activity to improve treatment of prostate and other hormone-responsive cancers.","[DeVore, Natasha M.; Scott, Emily E.] Univ Kansas, Dept Med Chem, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Scott, EE (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Dept Med Chem, 1251 Wescoe Hall Dr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",eescott@ku.edu,,,"US Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research; US National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Research Resources; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; NIH through the KU COBRE Center for Protein Structure and Function [NIH RR17708];  [GM076343]","X-ray data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL).

Thus, the cellular sources of these factors are undetermined. Stem cell factor (SCF; also known as KITL) is a key niche component that maintains HSCs. Here, using Scf(gfp) knock-in mice, we found that Scf was primarily expressed by perivascular cells throughout the bone marrow. HSC frequency and function were not affected when Scf was conditionally deleted from haematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, nestin-cre- or nestin-creER-expressing cells. However, HSCs were depleted from bone marrow when Scf was deleted from endothelial cells or leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing perivascular stromal cells. Most HSCs were lost when Scf was deleted from both endothelial and Lepr-expressing perivascular cells.

Here we show in mouse that PGC1-alpha expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of FNDC5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a newly identified hormone, irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and mildly increased irisin levels in the blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake. This results in improvements in obesity and glucose homeostasis. Irisin could be therapeutic for human metabolic disease and other disorders that are improved with exercise.","[Bostroem, Pontus; Wu, Jun; Korde, Anisha; Ye, Li; Lo, James C.; Rasbach, Kyle A.; Choi, Jang Hyun; Long, Jonathan Z.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jedrychowski, Mark P.; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bostroem, Elisabeth Almer] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Div Renal, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kajimura, Shingo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kajimura, Shingo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Zingaretti, Maria Cristina; Cinti, Saverio] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Azienda Osped Riuniti, Electron Microscopy Unit, I-60020 Ancona, Italy; [Vind, Birgitte F.; Hojlund, Kurt] Odense Univ Hosp, Diabet Res Ctr, Dept Endocrinol, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Tu, Hua] LakePharma Inc, Belmont, CA 94002 USA","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, 3 Blackfan Circle,CLS Bldg,Floor 11, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,"Choi, Jang Hyun/B-3055-2012",,"National Institutes of Health [DK54477, DK31405, DK61562]; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation; Svenska Sallskapet for Medicinsk Forskning; American Heart Association [09POST2010078]","This study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants DK54477, DK31405, DK61562 to B.

Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances.","[Krishnamurthy, Harini; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,,National Institutes of Health,"We thank D.

Although long anticipated(3-8), the existence of a 'circumbinary planet' orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery(9) of the planet transiting (that is, passing in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively. Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the Sun's mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation arising from the orbital motion of the stars. The observed rate of circumbinary planets in our sample implies that more than similar to 1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.","[Welsh, William F.; Orosz, Jerome A.; Short, Donald R.; Windmiller, Gur] San Diego State Univ, Dept Astron, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Fabrycky, Daniel C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Lick Observ, UCO, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ford, Eric B.] Univ Florida, Bryant Space Sci Ctr 211, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lissauer, Jack J.; Barclay, Thomas; Batalha, Natalie; Christiansen, Jessie L.; Haas, Michael R.; Howell, Steve B.; Jenkins, Jon M.; Li, Jie; Quintana, Elisa V.; Koch, David G.; Borucki, William J.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Carter, Joshua A.; Quinn, Samuel N.; Ragozzine, Darin; Torres, Guillermo; Holman, Matthew J.; Latham, David W.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Prsa, Andrej] Villanova Univ, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Quinn, Samuel N.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Doyle, Laurance R.; Caldwell, Douglas A.; Christiansen, Jessie L.; Jenkins, Jon M.; Li, Jie; Quintana, Elisa V.] SETI Inst, Carl Sagan Ctr Study Life Universe, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Barclay, Thomas] Bay Area Environm Res Inst Inc, Sonoma, CA 95476 USA; [Batalha, Natalie] San Jose State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Bloemen, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Star & Planet Format, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Brugamyer, Erik; Cochran, William D.; Endl, Michael] Univ Texas Austin, McDonald Observ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ciardi, David R.] CALTECH, NASA Exoplanet Sci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Fortney, Jonathan J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Gautier, Thomas N., III] Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Gilliland, Ronald L.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Klaus, Todd C.] NASA, Orbital Sci Corp, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mazeh, Tsevi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shporer, Avi] Las Cumbres Observ, Global Telescope Network, Santa Barbara, CA 93117 USA; [Shporer, Avi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Steffen, Jason H.] Fermilab Ctr Particle Astrophys, Batavia, IL 60510 USA","Welsh, WF (reprint author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Astron, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",wfw@sciences.sdsu.edu; jacarter@cfa.harvard.edu,"Steffen, Jason/A-4320-2013; Carter, Joshua/A-8280-2013; Ragozzine, Darin/C-4926-2013; Caldwell, Douglas/L-7911-2014; Howard, Andrew/D-4148-2015","Caldwell, Douglas/0000-0003-1963-9616; Howard, Andrew/0000-0001-8638-0320; Ciardi, David/0000-0002-5741-3047; Fabrycky, Daniel/0000-0003-3750-0183; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666; /0000-0001-6545-639X; Barclay, Thomas/0000-0001-7139-2724; Fortney, Jonathan/0000-0002-9843-4354",NASA's Science Mission Directorate; Kepler Participating Scientist Program; NSF; NASA; STScI; European Research Council under the European Community; Research Council of KU Leuven; FAS Science Division Research Computing Group at Harvard University,"Kepler was selected as the tenth NASA Discovery mission with funding provided by NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Although other mechanisms may also operate(4,5), currents from misaligned pressure and temperature gradients (the Biermann battery process) inevitably accompany the formation of galaxies in the absence of a primordial field. Driven by geometrical asymmetries in shocks(6) associated with the collapse of protogalactic structures, the Biermann battery is believed to generate tiny seed fields to a level of about 10(-21) gauss (refs 7, 8). With the advent of high-power laser systems in the past two decades, a new area of research has opened in which, using simple scaling relations(9,10), astrophysical environments can effectively be reproduced in the laboratory(11,12). Here we report the results of an experiment that produced seed magnetic fields by the Biermann battery effect. We show that these results can be scaled to the intergalactic medium, where turbulence, acting on timescales of around 700 million years, can amplify the seed fields(13,14) sufficiently to affect galaxy evolution.","[Gregori, G.; Murphy, C.

No such limit exists in the non-relativistic case, although in real physical systems, short-range interactions may be expected to restrict the propagation of information to finite velocities. The question of how fast correlations can spread in quantum many-body systems has been long studied(1). The existence of a maximal velocity, known as the Lieb-Robinson bound, has been shown theoretically to exist in several interacting many-body systems (for example, spins on a lattice(2-5))-such systems can be regarded as exhibiting an effective light cone that bounds the propagation speed of correlations. The existence of such a 'speed of light' has profound implications for condensed matter physics and quantum information, but has not been observed experimentally. Here we report the time-resolved detection of propagating correlations in an interacting quantum many-body system. By quenching a one-dimensional quantum gas in an optical lattice, we reveal how quasiparticle pairs transport correlations with a finite velocity across the system, resulting in an effective light cone for the quantum dynamics. Our results open perspectives for understanding the relaxation of closed quantum systems far from equilibrium(6), and for engineering the efficient quantum channels necessary for fast quantum computations(7).","[Cheneau, Marc; Endres, Manuel; Schauss, Peter; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Gross, Christian; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Barmettler, Peter; Poletti, Dario; Kollath, Corinna] Univ Geneva, Dept Phys Theor, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Kollath, Corinna] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Ctr Phys Theor, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Kuhr, Stefan] Univ Strathclyde, SUPA, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland","Cheneau, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",marc.cheneau@mpq.mpg,"Poletti, Dario/A-3028-2009; Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; _, _/B-4995-2012; Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Barmettler, Peter/K-2912-2012; Fukuhara, Takeshi/A-6254-2014; Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014; Gross, Christian/P-5475-2014","Poletti, Dario/0000-0001-5626-0176; Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Barmettler, Peter/0000-0003-0431-6726; Fukuhara, Takeshi/0000-0002-6702-9882; Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X; Gross, Christian/0000-0003-2292-5234; Schauss, Peter/0000-0002-8505-5195",MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS; 'Triangle de la physique'; ANR; SNSF; Fondation Ernst et Lucie Schmidheiny,"We thank C.

The introduction of X-ray free-electron lasers(8-10) makes it possible to pump new atomic X-ray lasers(11-13) with ultrashort pulse duration, extreme spectral brightness and full temporal coherence. Here we describe the implementation of an X-ray laser in the kiloelectronvolt energy regime, based on atomic population inversion and driven by rapid K-shell photo-ionization using pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser. We established a population inversion of the K alpha transition in singly ionized neon(14) at 1.46 nanometres (corresponding to a photon energy of 849 electronvolts) in an elongated plasma column created by irradiation of a gas medium. We observed strong amplified spontaneous emission from the end of the excited plasma. This resulted in femtosecond-duration, high-intensity X-ray pulses of much shorter wavelength and greater brilliance than achieved with previous atomic X-ray lasers. Moreover, this scheme provides greatly increased wavelength stability, monochromaticity and improved temporal coherence by comparison with present-day X-ray free-electron lasers. The atomic X-ray lasers realized here may be useful for high-resolution spectroscopy and nonlinear X-ray studies.","[Ryan, Duncan; Purvis, Michael; Rocca, Jorge J.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ryan, Duncan; Purvis, Michael; Rocca, Jorge J.] NSF Engn Res Ctr Extreme Ultraviolet Sci & Techno, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bozek, John D.; Bostedt, Christoph] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, LCLS, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Rohringer, Nina; London, Richard A.; Albert, Felicie; Dunn, James; Graf, Alexander; Hill, Randal; Hau-Riege, Stefan P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA","Rohringer, N (reprint author), DESY, Max Planck Adv Study Grp, Ctr Free Electron Laser Sci, Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany.",nina.rohringer@asg.mpg.de,"Rohringer, Nina/B-8030-2012; Albert, Felicie/G-2645-2013; Bozek, John/E-9260-2010; Rohringer, Nina/N-3238-2014","Bozek, John/0000-0001-7486-7238; Rohringer, Nina/0000-0001-7905-3567; Ryan, Duncan/0000-0001-7702-8499",US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; LLNL's LDRD [09-LW-044]; US Department of Energy Basic Energy Sciences AMOS,"This work was performed under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL; DE-AC52-07NA27344) and was supported by LLNL's LDRD programme, 09-LW-044.

Molecular organization is a direct consequence of the pathways involved in the supramolecular assembly process, which is more amenable to detailed study when using one-dimensional systems. In the case of protein fibrils, formation and growth have been attributed to complex aggregation pathways(6-8) that go beyond traditional concepts of homogeneous(9-11) and secondary (12-14) nucleation events. The self-assembly of synthetic supramolecular polymers has also been studied and even modulated(15-18), but our quantitative understanding of the processes involved remains limited. Here we report time-resolved observations of the formation of supramolecular polymers from pi-conjugated oligomers. Our kinetic experiments show the presence of a kinetically favoured metastable assembly that forms quickly but then transforms into the thermodynamically favoured form. Quantitative insight into the kinetic experiments was obtained from kinetic model calculations, which revealed two parallel and competing pathways leading to assemblies with opposite helicity. These insights prompt us to use a chiral tartaric acid as an auxiliary to change the thermodynamic preference of the assembly process(19). We find that we can force aggregation completely down the kinetically favoured pathway so that, on removal of the auxiliary, we obtain only metastable assemblies.","[Korevaar, Peter A.; Markvoort, Albert J.; Smulders, Maarten M.

Here, we characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania(8). We show that Hadza networks have important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate.

Their high intrinsic firing rates(1) (50 Hz) and extensive convergence(2,3) predict that their target neurons in the cerebellar nuclei would be largely inhibited unless Purkinje cells pause their spiking, yet Purkinje and nuclear neuron firing rates do not always vary inversely(4). One indication of how these synapses transmit information is that populations of Purkinje neurons synchronize their spikes during cerebellar behaviours(5-11). If nuclear neurons respond to Purkinje synchrony, they may encode signals from subsets of inhibitory inputs(7,12-14). Here we show in weanling and adult mice that nuclear neurons transmit the timing of synchronous Purkinje afferent spikes, owing to modest Purkinje-to-nuclear convergence ratios (similar to 40:1), fast inhibitory postsynaptic current kinetics (tau(decay) = 2.5 ms) and high intrinsic firing rates (similar to 90 Hz). In vitro, dynamically clamped asynchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials mimicking Purkinje afferents suppress nuclear cell spiking, whereas synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials entrain nuclear cell spiking. With partial synchrony, nuclear neurons time-lock their spikes to the synchronous subpopulation of inputs, even when only 2 out of 40 afferents synchronize. In vivo, nuclear neurons reliably phase-lock to regular trains of molecular layer stimulation. Thus, cerebellar nuclear neurons can preferentially relay the spike timing of synchronized Purkinje cells to downstream premotor areas.","[Person, Abigail L.; Raman, Indira M.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Raman, IM (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",a-person@northwestern.edu; i-raman@northwestern.edu,,,"NIH [R01-NS39395, F32-NS067831]","We are grateful to J.

To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.","[Ding, Li; Ley, Timothy J.; Larson, David E.; Miller, Christopher A.; Koboldt, Daniel C.; McLellan, Michael D.; McMichael, Joshua F.; Wallis, John W.; Lu, Charles; Shen, Dong; Harris, Christopher C.; Dooling, David J.; Fulton, Robert S.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Chen, Ken; Schmidt, Heather; Kalicki-Veizer, Joelle; Magrini, Vincent J.; Cook, Lisa; McGrath, Sean D.; Vickery, Tammi L.; Wendl, Michael C.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ding, Li; Wallis, John W.; Dooling, David J.; Fulton, Robert S.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Chen, Ken; Magrini, Vincent J.; Wendl, Michael C.; Kulkarni, Shashikant; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ley, Timothy J.; Welch, John S.; Ritchey, Julie K.; Young, Margaret A.; Lamprecht, Tamara; Heath, Sharon; Link, Daniel C.; Tomasson, Michael H.; Westervelt, Peter; Walter, Matthew J.; Graubert, Timothy A.; DiPersio, John F.] Washington Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Oncol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ley, Timothy J.; Link, Daniel C.; Tomasson, Michael H.; Kulkarni, Shashikant; Westervelt, Peter; Walter, Matthew J.; Graubert, Timothy A.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.; DiPersio, John F.] Washington Univ, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Watson, Mark A.; Payton, Jacqueline E.; Kulkarni, Shashikant] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Shannon, William D.] Washington Univ, Div Biostat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Ley, TJ (reprint author), Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",timley@wustl.edu,"Wendl, Michael/A-2741-2008; Miller, Christopher/A-1060-2009","Miller, Christopher/0000-0003-4266-6700; McGrath, Sean/0000-0001-9064-8449; Graubert, Timothy/0000-0002-7710-1171; Larson, David/0000-0001-7934-5906",Washington University Cancer Genome Initiative; National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [U54 HG003079]; National Cancer Institute [PO1 CA101937]; Barnes-Jewish Hospital Foundation [00335-0505-02],"We thank the Analysis Pipeline group for developing the automated sequence analysis pipelines; the LIMS group for developing tools and software to manage samples and sequencing; the Systems group for providing the IT infrastructure and HPC solutions required for sequencing and analysis; and R.

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood. The lysosomal degradation pathway, autophagy, is an intracellular recycling system that functions during basal conditions in organelle and protein quality control(2). During stress, increased levels of autophagy permit cells to adapt to changing nutritional and energy demands through protein catabolism(3). Moreover, in animal models, autophagy protects against diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, infections, inflammatory diseases, ageing and insulin resistance(4-6). Here we show that acute exercise induces autophagy in skeletal and cardiac muscle of fed mice. To investigate the role of exercise-mediated autophagy in vivo, we generated mutant mice that show normal levels of basal autophagy but are deficient in stimulus (exercise- or starvation)-induced autophagy. These mice (termed BCL2 AAA mice) contain knock-in mutations in BCL2 phosphorylation sites (Thr69Ala, Ser70Ala and Ser84Ala) that prevent stimulus-induced disruption of the BCL2-beclin-1 complex and autophagy activation. BCL2 AAA mice show decreased endurance and altered glucose metabolism during acute exercise, as well as impaired chronic exercise-mediated protection against high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance. Thus, exercise induces autophagy, BCL2 is a crucial regulator of exercise- (and starvation)-induced autophagy in vivo, and autophagy induction may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise.","[He, Congcong; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; An, Zhenyi; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Congcong; Sun, Kai; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; An, Zhenyi; Sun, Qihua; May, Herman I.; Hill, Joseph A.; Scherer, Philipp E.; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Congcong; Wei, Yongjie; Zou, Zhongju; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Bassik, Michael C.; Fisher, Jill; Korsmeyer, Stanley] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Moresi, Viviana; Bassel-Duby, Rhonda] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sun, Kai; Scherer, Philipp E.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Touchstone Diabet Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Loh, Joy; Virgin, Herbert W.] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA; [Packer, Milton; Xiao, Guanghua] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Gilpin, Christopher] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Levine, B (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Autophagy Res, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",beth.levine@utsouthwestern.edu,"Moresi, Viviana /N-7977-2013; An, Zhenyi/H-9061-2016",,"National Institutes of Health [RO1 CA109618, ROI HL080244, ROI HL090842, ROI AI084887, RCI DK086629, RO1 CA112023, 1PO1 DK0887761]","We thank the UT Southwestern Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Core and E.

We developed multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) that allowed us to view and measure stable isotope incorporation with submicrometre resolution(3,4). Here we apply MIMS to diverse organisms, including Drosophila, mice and humans. We test the 'immortal strand hypothesis', which predicts that during asymmetric stem cell division chromosomes containing older template DNA are segregated to the daughter destined to remain a stem cell, thus insuring lifetime genetic stability. After labelling mice with (15)N-thymidine from gestation until post-natal week 8, we find no (15)N label retention by dividing small intestinal crypt cells after a four-week chase. In adult mice administered (15)N-thymidine pulse-chase, we find that proliferating crypt cells dilute the (15)N label, consistent with random strand segregation. We demonstrate the broad utility of MIMS with proof-of-principle studies of lipid turnover in Drosophila and translation to the human haematopoietic system. These studies show that MIMS provides high-resolution quantification of stable isotope labels that cannot be obtained using other techniques and that is broadly applicable to biological and medical research.","[Steinhauser, Matthew L.; Senyo, Samuel E.; Guillermier, Christelle; Perlstein, Todd S.; Lee, Richard T.; Lechene, Claude P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Steinhauser, Matthew L.; Senyo, Samuel E.; Perlstein, Todd S.; Lee, Richard T.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bailey, Andrew P.; Gould, Alex P.] Natl Inst Med Res, Div Physiol & Metab, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England; [Guillermier, Christelle; Lechene, Claude P.] Natl Resource Imaging Mass Spect, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Guillermier, Christelle; Lechene, Claude P.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lee, Richard T.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lechene, CP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cpl@harvard.edu,"Gould, Alex/A-7479-2010","Gould, Alex/0000-0002-6875-6985","American Heart Association; Future Leaders in Cardiovascular Medicine; Medical Research Council [U117584237]; National Institutes of Health [AG032977, EB001974, AG034641]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Ellison Medical Foundation; Human Frontier Science Program","We thank A.

Among these are the stereocilia, each with a core of several hundred actin filaments that arise from their apical surfaces and that bear the mechanotransduction apparatus at their tips. Actin turnover in stereocilia has previously been studied(2) by transfecting neonatal rat hair cells in culture with a beta-actin-GFP fusion, and evidence was found that actin is replaced, from the top down, in 2-3 days. Overexpression of the actin-binding protein espin causes elongation of stereocilia within 12-24 hours, also suggesting rapid regulation of stereocilia lengths(3). Similarly, the mechanosensory 'tip links' are replaced in 5-10 hours after cleavage in chicken and mammalian hair cells(4,5). In contrast, turnover in chick stereocilia in vivo is much slower(6). It might be that only certain components of stereocilia turn over quickly, that rapid turnover occurs only in neonatal animals, only in culture, or only in response to a challenge like breakage or actin overexpression. Here we quantify protein turnover by feeding animals with a (15)N-labelled precursor amino acid and using multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry to measure appearance of new protein. Surprisingly, in adult frogs and mice and in neonatal mice, in vivo and in vitro, the stereocilia were remarkably stable, incorporating newly synthesized protein at <10% per day. Only stereocilia tips had rapid turnover and no treadmilling was observed. Other methods confirmed this: in hair cells expressing beta-actin-GFP we bleached fiducial lines across hair bundles, but they did not move in 6 days. When we stopped expression of beta- or gamma-actin with tamoxifen-inducible recombination, neither actin isoform left the stereocilia, except at the tips. Thus, rapid turnover in stereocilia occurs only at the tips and not by a treadmilling process.","[Poczatek, J.

Sphingolipids are structural components of membranes and can also act as intracellular second messengers. Not much is known of sphingolipids binding to transmembrane domains (TMDs) of proteins within the hydrophobic bilayer, and how this could affect protein function. Here we show a direct and highly specific interaction of exclusively one sphingomyelin species, SM 18, with the TMD of the COPI machinery protein p24 (ref. 2). Strikingly, the interaction depends on both the head-group and the backbone of the sphingolipid, and on a signature sequence (VXXTLXXIY) within the TMD. Molecular dynamics simulations show a close interaction of SM 18 with the TMD. We suggest a role of SM 18 in regulating the equilibrium between an inactive monomeric and an active oligomeric state of the p24 protein(3,4), which in turn regulates COPI-dependent transport. Bioinformatic analyses predict that the signature sequence represents a conserved sphingolipid-binding cavity in a variety of mammalian membrane proteins. Thus, in addition to a function as second messengers, sphingolipids can act as cofactors to regulate the function of transmembrane proteins. Our discovery of an unprecedented specificity of interaction of a TMD with an individual sphingolipid species adds to our understanding of why biological membranes are assembled from such a large variety of different lipids.","[Contreras, F. -Xabier; Ernst, Andreas M.; Haberkant, Per; Goenen, Basak; Wieland, Felix; Bruegger, Britta] Univ Heidelberg, Biochem Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Bjoerkholm, Patrik; Lindahl, Erik; Elofsson, Arne; von Heijne, Gunnar] Stockholm Univ, Ctr Biomembrane Res, Dept Biochem & Biophys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bjoerkholm, Patrik; Elofsson, Arne; von Heijne, Gunnar] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Bioinformat Ctr, Sci Life Lab, SE-17121 Solna, Sweden; [Lindahl, Erik] AlbaNova Univ Ctr, Royal Inst Technol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tischer, Christian; Pepperkok, Rainer] EMBL, ALMF, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Thiele, Christoph] LIMES Life & Med Sci Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Brugger, B (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Biochem Ctr, Neuenheimer Feld 328, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",britta.bruegger@bzh.uni-heidelberg.de,"Lindahl, Erik/D-4590-2013; von Heijne, Gunnar/F-5576-2011","Lindahl, Erik/0000-0002-2734-2794; von Heijne, Gunnar/0000-0002-4490-8569; Haberkant, Per/0000-0002-5608-9062; Bjorkholm, Patrik/0000-0002-9131-4122; Pepperkok, Rainer/0000-0002-9762-3583; Elofsson, Arne/0000-0002-7115-9751","German research foundation (DFG) [TRR83]; ERC [209825, AdG232648]; FEBS; Peter and Traudl Engelhorn foundation","The authors would like to thank T.

The carboxy-terminal region of KCNH channels contains a cyclic-nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD) and C-linker that couples the CNBHD to the pore(4). The C-linker/CNBHD is essential for proper function and trafficking of ion channels in the KCNH family(5-9). However, despite the importance of the C-linker/CNBHD for the function of KCNH channels, the structural basis of ion-channel regulation by the C-linker/CNBHD is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the C-linker/CNBHD of zebrafish ELK channels at 2.2-angstrom resolution. Although the overall structure of the C-linker/CNBHD of ELK channels is similar to the cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) structure of the related hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels(10), there are marked differences. Unlike the CNBD of HCN, the CNBHD of ELK displays a negatively charged electrostatic profile that explains the lack of binding and regulation of KCNH channels by cyclic nucleotides(4,11). Instead of cyclic nucleotide, the binding pocket is occupied by a short beta-strand. Mutations of the beta-strand shift the voltage dependence of activation to more depolarized voltages, implicating the beta-strand as an intrinsic ligand for the CNBHD of ELK channels. In both ELK and HCN channels the C-linker is the site of virtually all of the intersubunit interactions in the C-terminal region. However, in the zebrafish ELK structure there is a reorientation in the C-linker so that the subunits form dimers instead of tetramers, as observed in HCN channels. These results provide a structural framework for understanding the regulation of ion channels in the KCNH family by the C-linker/CNBHD and may guide the design of specific drugs.","[Brelidze, Tinatin I.; Carlson, Anne E.; Zagotta, William N.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Sch Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sankaran, Banumathi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley Ctr Struct Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zagotta, WN (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Sch Med, Box 357290, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",zagotta@u.washington.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 EY010329, F32 HL095241]; NIH, National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank M.

Tumours progress very quickly following RB1 inactivation but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the retinoblastoma genome is stable, but that multiple cancer pathways can be epigenetically deregulated. To identify the mutations that cooperate with RB1 loss, we performed whole-genome sequencing of retinoblastomas. The overall mutational rate was very low; RB1 was the only known cancer gene mutated. We then evaluated the role of RB1 in genome stability and considered non-genetic mechanisms of cancer pathway deregulation. For example, the proto-oncogene SYK is upregulated in retinoblastoma and is required for tumour cell survival. Targeting SYK with a small-molecule inhibitor induced retinoblastoma tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. Thus, retinoblastomas may develop quickly as a result of the epigenetic deregulation of key cancer pathways as a direct or indirect result of RB1 loss.","[Benavente, Claudia A.; McEvoy, Justina; Flores-Otero, Jacqueline; Brennan, Rachel; Dyer, Michael A.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Dev Neurobiol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Zhang, Jinghui; Chen, Xiang; Ulyanov, Anatoly; Wu, Gang; Rusch, Michael; Easton, John] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Ding, Li; Lu, Charles; Fulton, Robert S.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Hong, Xin; Dooling, David J.; Ochoa, Kerri; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ding, Li; Fulton, Robert S.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Hong, Xin; Dooling, David J.; Ochoa, Kerri; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Wilson, Matthew; Dyer, Michael A.] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Wilson, Matthew] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Surg, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Wang, Jianmin; Mukatira, Suraj; Gupta, Pankaj; Neale, Geoff] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Hartwell Ctr Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Manning, Amity L.; Dyson, Nicholas J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Ma, Jing; Shurtleff, Sheila; Mullighan, Charles; Bahrami, Armita; Ellison, David; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Pounds, Stanley] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Biostat, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Zhao, David; Naeve, Clayton] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Informat Sci, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med St Louis, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Dyer, Michael A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Dyer, MA (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Dev Neurobiol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",rwilson@wustl.edu; james.downing@stjude.org; michael.dyer@stjude.org,,"Pounds, Stanley/0000-0002-9167-2114; McEvoy, Justina/0000-0003-0382-1288; Benavente, Claudia/0000-0002-6875-3186; Mullighan, Charles/0000-0002-1871-1850","St Jude Children's Research Hospital - Washington University; St Jude Children's Research Hospital; NCI [CA21765]; NIH [EY014867, EY018599, GM81607, CA64402]; American Cancer Society; Research to Prevent Blindness Foundation; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities; MGH Cancer Center Saltonstall Foundation; AstraZeneca","The WGS was supported as part of the St Jude Children's Research Hospital - Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project.

They regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues in histone tails, resulting in chromatin condensation. The enzymatic activity of most class I HDACs requires recruitment into multi-subunit co-repressor complexes, which are in turn recruited to chromatin by repressive transcription factors. Here we report the structure of a complex between an HDAC and a co-repressor, namely, human HDAC3 with the deacetylase activation domain (DAD) from the human SMRT co-repressor (also known as NCOR2). The structure reveals two remarkable features. First, the SMRT-DAD undergoes a large structural rearrangement on forming the complex. Second, there is an essential inositol tetraphosphate molecule-D-myo-inositol-(1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P-4)-acting as an 'intermolecular glue' between the two proteins. Assembly of the complex is clearly dependent on the Ins(1,4,5,6)P-4, which may act as a regulator-potentially explaining why inositol phosphates and their kinases have been found to act as transcriptional regulators. This mechanism for the activation of HDAC3 appears to be conserved in class I HDACs from yeast to humans, and opens the way to novel therapeutic opportunities.","[Watson, Peter J.; Fairall, Louise; Santos, Guilherme M.; Schwabe, John W.

The Local Group, however, may be anomalous in this regard(6,7). A massive dark satellite in an early-type lens galaxy at a redshift of 0.222 was recently found(8) using a method based on gravitational lensing(9,10), suggesting that the mass fraction contained in substructure could be higher than is predicted from simulations. The lack of very low-mass detections, however, prohibited any constraint on their mass function. Here we report the presence of a (1.9 +/- 0.1) x 10(8)M(circle dot) dark satellite galaxy in the Einstein ring system JVAS B1938+666 (ref. 11) at a redshift of 0.881, where M(circle dot) denotes the solar mass. This satellite galaxy has a mass similar to that of the Sagittarius(12) galaxy, which is a satellite of the Milky Way. We determine the logarithmic slope of the mass function for substructure beyond the local Universe to be 1.1(-0.4)(+0.6), with an average mass fraction of 3.3(-1.8)(+3.6) per cent, by combining data on both of these recently discovered galaxies. Our results are consistent with the predictions from cold dark matter simulations(13-15) at the 95 per cent confidence level, and therefore agree with the view that galaxies formed hierarchically in a Universe composed of cold dark matter.","[Vegetti, S.] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lagattuta, D.

Standard fabrication techniques already allow the isolation of single electron spins in silicon transistor-like devices. Although this is also possible in other materials, silicon-based systems have the advantage of interacting more weakly with nuclear spins. Reducing such interactions is important for the control of spin quantum bits because nuclear fluctuations limit quantum phase coherence, as seen in recent experiments in GaAs-based quantum dots(1,2). Advances in reducing nuclear decoherence effects by means of complex control(3-5) still result in coherence times much shorter than those seen in experiments on large ensembles of impurity-bound electrons in bulk silicon crystals(6,7). Here we report coherent control of electron spins in two coupled quantum dots in an undoped Si/SiGe heterostructure and show that this system has a nuclei-induced dephasing time of 360 nanoseconds, which is an increase by nearly two orders of magnitude over similar measurements in GaAs-based quantum dots. The degree of phase coherence observed, combined with fast, gated electrical initialization, read-out and control, should motivate future development of silicon-based quantum information processors.","[Maune, B.

In soft materials such as amphiphilic lipids and liquid crystals, the competition between local chiral interactions and global constraints imposed by the geometry of the self-assembled structures leads to frustration and the assembly of unique materials(3-6). An example of particular interest is smectic liquid crystals, where the two-dimensional layered geometry cannot support twist and chirality is consequently expelled to the edges in a manner analogous to the expulsion of a magnetic field from superconductors(7-10). Here we demonstrate a consequence of this geometric frustration that leads to a new design principle for the assembly of chiral molecules. Using a model system of colloidal membranes(11), we show that molecular chirality can control the interfacial tension, an important property of multi-component mixtures. This suggests an analogy between chiral twist, which is expelled to the edges of two-dimensional membranes, and amphiphilic surfactants, which are expelled to oil-water interfaces(12). As with surfactants, chiral control of interfacial tension drives the formation of many polymorphic assemblages such as twisted ribbons with linear and circular topologies, starfish membranes, and double and triple helices. Tuning molecular chirality in situ allows dynamical control of line tension, which powers polymorphic transitions between various chiral structures. These findings outline a general strategy for the assembly of reconfigurable chiral materials that can easily be moved, stretched, attached to one another and transformed between multiple conformational states, thus allowing precise assembly and nanosculpting of highly dynamical and designable materials with complex topologies.","[Gibaud, Thomas; Barry, Edward; Zakhary, Mark J.; Henglin, Mir; Ward, Andrew; Yang, Yasheng; Hagan, Michael F.; Meyer, Robert B.; Dogic, Zvonimir] Brandeis Univ, Martin Fisher Sch Phys, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Berciu, Cristina; Nicastro, Daniela] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Oldenbourg, Rudolf] Marine Biol Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Dogic, Z (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Martin Fisher Sch Phys, 415 South St, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",zdogic@brandeis.edu,"Gibaud, Thomas/D-1276-2009; Hagan, Michael/N-2177-2014","Gibaud, Thomas/0000-0003-4826-8025; Hagan, Michael/0000-0002-9211-2434","US National Science Foundation [NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057, NSF-CMMI-1068566]; Petroleum Research Fund [ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7]","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057, NSF-CMMI-1068566) and the Petroleum Research Fund (ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7).

During ascent, they travel through about 150 kilometres of cratonic mantle lithosphere and entrain seemingly prohibitive loads (more than 25 per cent by volume) of mantle-derived xenoliths and xenocrysts (including diamond)(4,5). Kimberlite magmas also reputedly have higher ascent rates(6-9) than other xenolith-bearing magmas(10,11). Exsolution of dissolved volatiles (carbon dioxide and water) is thought to be essential to provide sufficient buoyancy for the rapid ascent of these dense, crystal-rich magmas. The cause and nature of such exsolution, however, remains elusive and is rarely specified(6,9). Here we use a series of high-temperature experiments to demonstrate a mechanism for the spontaneous, efficient and continuous production of this volatile phase. This mechanism requires parental melts of kimberlite to originate as carbonatite-like melts. In transit through the mantle lithosphere, these silica-undersaturated melts assimilate mantle minerals, especially orthopyroxene, driving the melt to more silicic compositions, and causing a marked drop in carbon dioxide solubility. The solubility drop manifests itself immediately in a continuous and vigorous exsolution of a fluid phase, thereby reducing magma density, increasing buoyancy, and driving the rapid and accelerating ascent of the increasingly kimberlitic magma. Our model provides an explanation for continuous ascent of magmas laden with high volumes of dense mantle cargo, an explanation for the chemical diversity of kimberlite, and a connection between kimberlites and cratons.","[Russell, James K.; Porritt, Lucy A.] Univ British Columbia, Volcanol & Petrol Lab, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Lavallee, Yan; Dingwell, Donald B.] Univ Munich, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Russell, JK (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Volcanol & Petrol Lab, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",krussell@eos.ubc.ca,"Dingwell, Donald/A-4724-2011","Dingwell, Donald/0000-0002-3332-789X; Russell, Kelly/0000-0002-2062-3155",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Marie Curie outbound fellowship; ERC,"We acknowledge the laboratory support of W.

Theory proposes that early warning signals may be based on the phenomenon that recovery rates from small perturbations should tend to zero when approaching a tipping point(2,3); however, evidence that this happens in living systems is lacking. Here we test such 'critical slowing down' using a microcosmin which photo-inhibition drives a cyanobacterial population to a classical tipping point when a critical light level is exceeded. We show that over a large range of conditions, recovery from small perturbations becomes slower as the system comes closer to the critical point. In addition, autocorrelation in the subtle fluctuations of the system's state rose towards the tipping point, supporting the idea that this metric can be used as an indirect indicator of slowing down(4,5). Although stochasticity prohibits prediction of the timing of critical transitions, our results suggest that indicators of slowing down may be used to rank complex systems on a broad scale from resilient to fragile.","[Veraart, Annelies J.; Faassen, Elisabeth J.; Dakos, Vasilis; van Nes, Egbert H.; Lurling, Miquel; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lurling, Miquel] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands","van Nes, EH (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",egbert.vannes@wur.nl,"van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012; Dakos, Vasilis/D-6488-2012; Veraart, Annelies/E-1927-2014; Faassen, Elisabeth/P-5411-2015; Library, Library/A-4320-2012","van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X; Veraart, Annelies/0000-0001-6286-7484; Faassen, Elisabeth/0000-0001-9098-8662; Library, Library/0000-0002-3835-159X; Dakos, Vasilis/0000-0001-8862-718X",European Research Council; Spinoza award,"We thank M.

Despite much speculation, strong evidence of the mechanisms by which these assemblies evolved is lacking. Here we use ancestral gene resurrection(9-11) and manipulative genetic experiments to determine how the complexity of an essential molecular machine-the hexameric transmembrane ring of the eukaryotic V-ATPase proton pump-increased hundreds of millions of years ago. We show that the ring of Fungi, which is composed of three paralogous proteins, evolved from a more ancient two-paralogue complex because of a gene duplication that was followed by loss in each daughter copy of specific interfaces by which it interacts with other ring proteins. These losses were complementary, so both copies became obligate components with restricted spatial roles in the complex. Reintroducing a single historical mutation from each paralogue lineage into the resurrected ancestral proteins is sufficient to recapitulate their asymmetric degeneration and trigger the requirement for the more elaborate three-component ring. Our experiments show that increased complexity in an essential molecular machine evolved because of simple, high-probability evolutionary processes, without the apparent evolution of novel functions. They point to a plausible mechanism for the evolution of complexity in other multi-paralogue protein complexes.","[Hanson-Smith, Victor; Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Finnigan, Gregory C.; Stevens, Tom H.] Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Hanson-Smith, Victor] Univ Oregon, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Oregon, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Thornton, JW (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",joet@uoregon.edu,,"Stevens, Tom/0000-0001-6427-6848; Finnigan, Gregory/0000-0002-5710-173X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01-GM081592, R01-GM38006, T32-GM007257]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [IOB-0546906, DEB-0516530]; NSF IGERT [DGE-9972830]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","This study was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01-GM081592 (to J.W.T.) and R01-GM38006 (to T.

We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3.

The AIDS virus, human immuno deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), produces the accessory factor Vif, which counteracts the host's antiviral defence by hijacking a ubiquitin ligase complex, containing CUL5, ELOC, ELOB and a RING-box protein, and targeting APOBEC3G for degradation(4-10). Here we reveal, using an affinity tag/purification mass spectrometry approach, that Vif additionally recruits the transcription cofactor CBF-beta to this ubiquitin ligase complex. CBF-beta, which normally functions in concert with RUNX DNA binding proteins, allows the reconstitution of a recombinant six-protein assembly that elicits specific polyubiquitination activity with APOBEC3G, but not the related deaminase APOBEC3A. Using RNA knockdown and genetic complementation studies, we also demonstrate that CBF-beta is required for Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G and therefore for preserving HIV-1 infectivity. Finally, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vif also binds to and requires CBF-beta to degrade rhesus macaque APOBEC3G, indicating functional conservation. Methods of disrupting the CBF-beta-Vif interaction might enable HIV-1 restriction and provide a supplement to current antiviral therapies that primarily target viral proteins.","[Hultquist, Judd F.; Shindo, Keisuke; LaRue, Rebecca S.; Li, Ming; Anderson, Brett D.; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Mol Virol, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Ctr Genome Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Jaeger, Stefanie; Mahon, Cathal; Kane, Joshua; Franks-Skiba, Kathy; Krogan, Nevan J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Jaeger, Stefanie; Mahon, Cathal; Kane, Joshua; Franks-Skiba, Kathy; Cimermancic, Peter; Burlingame, Alma; Sali, Andrej; Craik, Charles S.; Gross, John D.; Krogan, Nevan J.] QB3, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Kim, Dong Young; Kwon, Eunju; Yen, Linda; Stanley, David; Mahon, Cathal; Burlingame, Alma; Sali, Andrej; Craik, Charles S.; Gross, John D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Cimermancic, Peter; Sali, Andrej] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sali, Andrej; Gross, John D.; Krogan, Nevan J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, HPC Host Pathogen Circuitry Grp, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Krogan, Nevan J.] J David Gladstone Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Harris, RS (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Mol Virol, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Ctr Genome Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",rsh@umn.edu; jdgross@cgl.ucsf.edu; krogan@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,"QB3 at University of California, San Francisco; National Institutes of Health [P50 GM082250, P01 AI090935, P50 GM081879, U54 RR022220, R01 AI064046, P01 GM091743, P41RR001614, P50GM081879]","We thank members of the Krogan, Gross and Harris laboratories for comments, J.

HIV-1 Vif forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with cullin 5 (CUL5), elongin B and elongin C (7-9), which promotes the polyubiquitination and degradation of APOBEC3 substrates(7,10-14). Here we demonstrate in human T cells that core binding factor beta (CBF-beta) is a key regulator of the evasion of HIV-1 from the host defence mediated by APOBEC3. CBF-beta, the non-DNA-binding subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, regulates the folding and DNA-binding activity of partner RUNX family proteins, which have important roles in the development and differentiation of diverse cell types, including T lymphocytes(15,16). In our study, knockdown of endogenous CBF-beta blocked Vif-induced APOBEC3G polyubiquitination and degradation. CBF-beta was not required for the interaction between Vif and APOBEC3G, yet was essential for the assembly of the Vif-CUL5 E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex. CBF-beta proved to be a unique regulator of primate lentiviral Vif and not a general component of the CUL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase. We show that Vif and CBF-beta physically interact, and that the amino-terminal region of Vif is required for this interaction. Furthermore, interactions with Vif required regions in CBF-beta that are not involved in RUNX protein binding(17-19). Considering the importance of the interaction between Vif and CBF-beta, disrupting this interaction represents an attractive pharmacological intervention against HIV-1.","[Zhang, Wenyan; Du, Juan; Yu, Xiao-Fang] Jilin Univ, Hosp 1, Inst Virol & AIDS Res, Changchun 130021, Jilin Province, Peoples R China; [Du, Juan; Evans, Sean L.; Yu, Yunkai; Yu, Xiao-Fang] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Yu, XF (reprint author), Jilin Univ, Hosp 1, Inst Virol & AIDS Res, Changchun 130021, Jilin Province, Peoples R China.",xfyu@jhsph.edu,,,"Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB911100]; Chinese Ministry of Education [IRT1016]; Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Jilin Province, China [20102209]; NIAID [2R56AI62644-6]","We thank K.

In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol(1-3). However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic glycolysis and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty-acid synthesis(4). Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis(5), the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of alpha-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells.","[Metallo, Christian M.; Gameiro, Paulo A.; Hiller, Karsten; Kelleher, Joanne K.; Stephanopoulos, Gregory] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gameiro, Paulo A.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; [Gameiro, Paulo A.; Yang, Juanjuan; Iliopoulos, Othon] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gameiro, Paulo A.; Yang, Juanjuan; Iliopoulos, Othon] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Bell, Eric L.; Mattaini, Katherine R.; Guarente, Leonard; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mattaini, Katherine R.; Jewell, Christopher M.; Johnson, Zachary R.; Irvine, Darrell J.; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] MIT, Koch Inst Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Irvine, Darrell J.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Stephanopoulos, G (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",iliopoul@helix.mgh.harvard.edu; gregstep@mit.edu,"Bell, Eric/F-6368-2012",,National Institutes of Health [R01 DK075850-01]; American Cancer Society; German Research Foundation (DFG) [HI1400]; Glenn Foundation for Medical Research; Burrough's Wellcome Fund; Smith Family; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; National Cancer Institute; Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center;  [R01 CA122591],"We thank N.

In normally functioning tumour cell mitochondria, oxidative metabolism of glucose- and glutamine-derived carbon produces citrate and acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis, which is required for tumorigenesis(3). Yet some tumours harbour mutations in the citric acid cycle (CAC) or electron transport chain (ETC) that disable normal oxidative mitochondrial function(4-7), and it is unknown how cells from such tumours generate precursors for macromolecular synthesis. Here we show that tumour cells with defective mitochondria use glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation rather than oxidative metabolism as the major pathway of citrate formation. This pathway uses mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of NADP(+)/NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and subsequent metabolism of glutamine-derived citrate provides both the acetylcoenzyme A for lipid synthesis and the four-carbon intermediates needed to produce the remaining CAC metabolites and related macromolecular precursors. This reductive, glutamine-dependent pathway is the dominant mode of metabolism in rapidly growing malignant cells containing mutations in complex I or complex III of the ETC, in patient-derived renal carcinoma cells with mutations in fumarate hydratase, and in cells with normal mitochondria subjected to acute pharmacological ETC inhibition. Our findings reveal the novel induction of a versatile glutamine-dependent pathway that reverses many of the reactions of the canonical CAC, supports tumour cell growth, and explains how cells generate pools of CAC intermediates in the face of impaired mitochondrial metabolism.","[Mullen, Andrew R.; Chen, Pei-Hsuan; Cheng, Tzuling; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wheaton, William W.; Sullivan, Lucas B.; Chandel, Navdeep S.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Wheaton, William W.; Sullivan, Lucas B.; Chandel, Navdeep S.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Jin, Eunsook S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Jin, Eunsook S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Yang, Youfeng; Linehan, W.

Here we map genome-wide ER-binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcomes and in distant ER-positive metastases. We find that drug-resistant cancers still recruit ER to the chromatin, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER-binding regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired ER regulatory regions associated with poor clinical outcome observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER-positive disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER-binding programme observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FOXA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid time-scale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FOXA1 binding events in drug-resistant cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FOXA1 in metastatic samples. By establishing transcription-factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that there is plasticity in ER-binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes.","[Ross-Innes, Caryn S.; Stark, Rory; Holmes, Kelly A.; Ali, H.

Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK)-cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection(1-3), implying that NK cells have a role in these T-cell-associated diseases. Although direct NK-cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to antiviral defence during some virus infections-especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans(4,5)-NK cells have also been suspected of having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T-cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells(6,7). In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems to be resistant to any direct antiviral effects of NK cells(5,8). Here we examine the roles of NK cells in regulating T-cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus doses, NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at medium doses NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T-cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T-cell-mediated support for the antiviral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.","[Waggoner, Stephen N.; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; [Waggoner, Stephen N.; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Immunol & Virol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; [Cornberg, Markus] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany","Welsh, RM (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",Raymond.Welsh@umassmed.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI07349, AI-17672, AI-081675, CA34461, AI46578]; German Research Foundation [CO310-2/1]; institutional Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center (DERC) [DK52530]","We thank K.

The explosion could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs(2,3) (a 'double-degenerate' origin), or by mass transfer from a companion star(4,5) (the 'single-degenerate' path). The identity of the progenitor is still controversial; for example, a recent argument against the single-degenerate origin(6) has been widely rejected(7-11). One way to distinguish between the double-and single-degenerate progenitors is to look at the centre of a known type Ia supernova remnant to see whether any former companion star is present(12,13). A likely ex-companion star for the progenitor of the supernova observed by Tycho Brahe has been identified(14), but that claim is still controversial(15-18). Here we report that the central region of the supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5 (the site of a type Ia supernova 400650 years ago, based on its light echo(19,20)) in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains no ex-companion star to a visualmagnitude limit of 26.9 (an absolute magnitude of M-V = +8.4) within a region of radius 1.43 arcseconds. (This corresponds to the 3 sigma maximum distance to which a companion could have been 'kicked' by the explosion.) This lack of any ex-companion star to deep limits rules out all published single-degenerate models for this supernova. The only remaining possibility is that the progenitor of this particular type Ia supernova was a double-degenerate system.","[Schaefer, Bradley E.; Pagnotta, Ashley] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Schaefer, BE (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",schaefer@lsu.edu,,"Pagnotta, Ashley/0000-0002-8669-217X",National Science Foundation,The HST images were taken as part of two programmes with Principal Investigators J.

Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studies find that around 17-30% (refs 4, 5) of solar-like stars host a planet. Gravitational microlensing(6-9), on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing(10). These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way(10). Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10 AU (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that 17(-9)(+6)% of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10M(J), where M-J = 318 M-circle plus and M-circle plus is Earth's mass). Cool Neptunes (10-30 M-circle plus) and super-Earths (5-10 M-circle plus) are even more common: their respective abundances per star are 52(-29)(+22)% and 62(-37)(+35)%.

It makes universal reversible classical computation(1) possible and, together with a Hadamard gate(2), forms a universal set of gates in quantum computation. It is also a key element in quantum error correction schemes(3-7). The Toffoli gate has been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance(3), linear optics(8) and ion trap systems(9). Experiments with superconducting qubits have also shown significant progress recently: two-qubit algorithms(10) and two-qubit process tomography have been implemented(11), three-qubit entangled states have been prepared(12,13), first steps towards quantum teleportation have been taken(14) and work on quantum computing architectures has been done(15). Implementation of the Toffoli gate with only single-and two-qubit gates requires six controlled-NOT gates and ten single-qubit operations(16), and has not been realized in any system owing to current limits on coherence. Here we implement a Toffoli gate with three superconducting transmon qubits coupled to a microwave resonator. By exploiting the third energy level of the transmon qubits, we have significantly reduced the number of elementary gates needed for the implementation of the Toffoli gate, relative to that required in theoretical proposals using only two-level systems. Using full process tomography and Monte Carlo process certification, we completely characterize the Toffoli gate acting on three independent qubits, measuring a fidelity of 68.5 +/- 0.5 per cent. A similar approach(15) to realizing characteristic features of a Toffoli-class gate has been demonstrated with two qubits and a resonator and achieved a limited characterization considering only the phase fidelity. Our results reinforce the potential of macroscopic superconducting qubits for the implementation of complex quantum operations with the possibility of quantum error correction(17).","[Fedorov, A.; Steffen, L.; Baur, M.; Wallraff, A.] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [da Silva, M.

Verwey proposed in 1939 that this transition is driven by a charge ordering of Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) ions(1), but the ground state of the low-temperature phase has remained contentious(2,3) because twinning of crystal domains hampers diffraction studies of the structure(4). Recent powder diffraction refinements(5-7) and resonant X-ray studies(8-12) have led to proposals of a variety of charge-ordered and bond-dimerized ground-state models(13-19). Here we report the full low-temperature superstructure of magnetite, determined by high-energy X-ray diffraction from an almost single-domain, 40-micrometre grain, and identify the emergent order. The acentric structure is described by a superposition of 168 atomic displacement waves (frozen phonon modes), all with amplitudes of less than 0.24 angstroms. Distortions of the FeO(6) octahedra show that Verwey's hypothesis is correct to a first approximation and that the charge and Fe(2+) orbital order are consistent with a recent prediction(17). However, anomalous shortening of some Fe-Fe distances suggests that the localized electrons are distributed over linear three-Fe-site units, which we call 'trimerons'. The charge order and three-site distortions induce substantial off-centre atomic displacements and couple the resulting large electrical polarization to the magnetization. Trimerons may be important quasiparticles in magnetite above the Verwey transition and in other transition metal oxides.","[Senn, Mark S.; Attfield, J.

Simply driven by buoyancy forces, mantle convection is complicated by the nature of the convecting materials, which are not fluids but polycrystalline rocks. Crystalline materials can flow as the result of the motion of defects-point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries and so on. Reproducing in the laboratory the extreme deformation conditions of the mantle is extremely challenging. In particular, experimental strain rates are at least six orders of magnitude larger than in nature(1). Here we show that the rheology of MgO at the pressure, temperature and strain rates of the mantle is accessible by multiscale numerical modelling starting from first principles and with no adjustable parameters. Our results demonstrate that extremely low strain rates counteract the influence of pressure. In the mantle, MgO deforms in the athermal regime and this leads to a very weak phase. It is only in the lowermost lower mantle that the pressure effect could dominate and that, under the influence of lattice friction, a viscosity of the order of 10(21)-10(22) pascal seconds can be defined for MgO.","[Cordier, Patrick; Amodeo, Jonathan; Carrez, Philippe] Univ Lille 1, Unite Mat & Transformat, CNRS, UMR 8207, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Cordier, P (reprint author), Univ Lille 1, Unite Mat & Transformat, CNRS, UMR 8207, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",Patrick.Cordier@univ-lille1.fr,"Cordier, Patrick/D-2357-2012; Amodeo, Jonathan/I-2934-2012","Cordier, Patrick/0000-0002-1883-2994; Carrez, Philippe/0000-0003-1295-9377",ANR,This work was supported by ANR (Diup project).,,44,44,44,5,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2012,481,7380,,,,,177,+,,10.1038/nature10687,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,874TO,WOS:000298981200034,22237109,No,,,11/20/17

Since then the inertia of swinging appendages has been implicated in stabilizing human walking(2,3), aiding acrobatic manoeuvres by primates(4-8) and rodents(9), and enabling cats to balance on branches(10). Recent studies on geckos(11-13) suggest that active tail stabilization occurs during climbing, righting and gliding. By contrast, studies on the effect of lizard tail loss show evidence of a decrease, an increase or no change in performance(14,15). Application of a control-theoretic framework could advance our general understanding of inertial appendage use in locomotion. Here we report that lizards control the swing of their tails in a measured manner to redirect angular momentum from their bodies to their tails, stabilizing body attitude in the sagittal plane. We video-recorded Red-Headed Agama lizards (Agama agama) leaping towards a vertical surface by first vaulting onto an obstacle with variable traction to induce a range of perturbations in body angular momentum. To examine a known controlled tail response, we built a lizard-sized robot with an active tail that used sensory feedback to stabilize pitch as it drove off a ramp. Our dynamics model revealed that a body swinging its tail experienced less rotation than a body with a rigid tail, a passively compliant tail or no tail. To compare a range of tails, we calculated tail effectiveness as the amount of tailless body rotation a tail could stabilize. A model Velociraptor mongoliensis supported the initial tail stabilization hypothesis(1), showing as it did a greater tail effectiveness than the Agama lizards. Leaping lizards show that inertial control of body attitude can advance our understanding of appendage evolution and provide biological inspiration for the next generation of manoeuvrable search-and-rescue robots.","[Moore, Talia Y.; Li, Deborah; Jusufi, Ardian; Full, Robert J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Libby, Thomas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Interdisciplinary Bioinspirat Educ & Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chang-Siu, Evan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cohen, Daniel J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Full, RJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rjfull@berkeley.edu,"Moore, Talia/E-1210-2012","Moore, Talia/0000-0003-0867-4512; Jusufi, Ardian/0000-0003-4250-2984",US NSF FIBR; MAST CTA; NSF IGERT [DGE-0903711]; Swiss NSF,"We thank P.

In neurons, the paternal allele of UBE3A is intact but epigenetically silenced(4-6), raising the possibility that Angelman syndrome could be treated by activating this silenced allele to restore functional UBE3A protein(7,8). Using an unbiased, high-content screen in primary cortical neurons from mice, we identify twelve topoisomerase I inhibitors and four topoisomerase II inhibitors that unsilence the paternal Ube3a allele. These drugs included topotecan, irinotecan, etoposide and dexrazoxane (ICRF-187). At nanomolar concentrations, topotecan upregulated catalytically active UBE3A in neurons from maternal Ube3a-null mice. Topotecan concomitantly downregulated expression of the Ube3a antisense transcript that overlaps the paternal copy of Ube3a(9-11). These results indicate that topotecan unsilences Ube3a in cis by reducing transcription of an imprinted antisense RNA. When administered in vivo, topotecan unsilenced the paternal Ube3a allele in several regions of the nervous system, including neurons in the hippocampus, neocortex, striatum, cerebellum and spinal cord. Paternal expression of Ube3a remained elevated in a subset of spinal cord neurons for at least 12 weeks after cessation of topotecan treatment, indicating that transient topoisomerase inhibition can have enduring effects on gene expression. Although potential off-target effects remain to be investigated, our findings suggest a therapeutic strategy for reactivating the functional but dormant allele of Ube3a in patients with Angelman syndrome.","[Huang, Hsien-Sung; Mabb, Angela M.; King, Ian F.; Miriyala, Jayalakshmi; Taylor-Blake, Bonnie; Dutton, J.

We previously identified a set of human microRNAs ( miRNAs) that robustly suppress breast cancer metastasis to lung and bone(5,6) and which display expression levels that predict human metastasis. Although these findings revealed miRNAs as suppressors of cell-autonomous metastatic phenotypes, the roles of noncoding RNAs in non-cell-autonomous cancer progression processes remain unknown. Here we reveal that endogenous miR-126, an miRNA silenced in a variety of common human cancers(7,8), non-cell-autonomously regulates endothelial cell recruitment to metastatic breast cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. It suppresses metastatic endothelial recruitment, metastatic angiogenesis and metastatic colonization through coordinate targeting of IGFBP2, PITPNC1 and MERTK-novel pro-angiogenic genes and biomarkers of human metastasis. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ( IGFBP2) secreted by metastatic cells recruits endothelia by modulating IGF1-mediated activation of the IGF type-I receptor on endothelial cells; whereas c-Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK) receptor cleaved from metastatic cells promotes endothelial recruitment by competitively antagonizing the binding of its ligand GAS6 to endothelial MERTK receptors. Co-injection of endothelial cells with breast cancer cells non-cell-autonomously rescues their miR-126-induced metastatic defect, revealing a novel and important role for endothelial interactions in metastatic initiation. Through loss-of-function and epistasis experiments, we delineate an miRNA regulatory network's individual components as novel and cell-extrinsic regulators of endothelial recruitment, angiogenesis and metastatic colonization. We also identify the IGFBP2/IGF1/IGF1R and GAS6/MERTK signalling pathways as regulators of cancer-mediated endothelial recruitment. Our work further reveals endothelial recruitment and endothelial interactions in the tumour microenvironment to be critical features of metastatic breast cancer.","[Png, Kim J.; Halberg, Nils; Yoshida, Mitsukuni; Tavazoie, Sohail F.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Syst Canc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Tavazoie, SF (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Syst Canc Biol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",stavazoie@mail.rockefeller.edu,,"Halberg, Nils/0000-0002-2943-3147",,,,18,232,244,10,104,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jan,2012,481,7380,,,,,190,+,,10.1038/nature10661,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,874TO,WOS:000298981200037,22170610,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we report that the zinc finger protein Ars2 (arsenite-resistance protein 2; also known as Srrt) is expressed by adult NSCs from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of mice, and that selective knockdown of Ars2 in cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein within the adult SVZ depletes the number of NSCs and their neurogenic capacity. These phenotypes are recapitulated in the postnatal SVZ of hGFAP-cre:: Ars2(fl/fl) conditional knockout mice, but are more severe. Ex vivo assays show that Ars2 is necessary and sufficient to promote NSC self-renewal, and that it does so by positively regulating the expression of Sox2. Although plant(1-3) and animal(4,5) orthologues of Ars2 are known for their conserved roles in microRNA biogenesis, we unexpectedly observed that Ars2 retains its capacity to promote self-renewal in Drosha and Dicer1 knockout NSCs. Instead, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Ars2 binds a specific region within the 6-kilobase NSC enhancer of Sox2. This association is RNA-independent, and the region that is bound is required for Ars2-mediated activation of Sox2. We used gel-shift analysis to refine the Sox2 region bound by Ars2 to a specific conserved DNA sequence. The importance of Sox2 as a critical downstream effector is shown by its ability to restore the self-renewal and multipotency defects of Ars2 knockout NSCs. Our findings reveal Ars2 as a new transcription factor that controls the multipotent progenitor state of NSCs through direct activation of the pluripotency factor Sox2.","[Andreu-Agullo, Celia; Maurin, Thomas; Lai, Eric C.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Dev Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Thompson, Craig B.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Canc Biol & Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA","Andreu-Agullo, C (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Dev Biol, 1275 York Ave,Box 252, New York, NY 10065 USA.",andreuac@mskcc.org; laie@mskcc.org,"Maurin, thomas/O-7494-2016",,Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Starr Cancer Consortium [I3-A139]; NIH [R01-GM083300]; EMBO [ALTF 718-2008]; NYSTEM Fellowship,"We thank X.

A key mechanism required for maintaining a homeostatic balance between this microbial burden and the lymphocytes that densely populate the gastrointestinal tract is the production and transepithelial transport of poly-reactive IgA (ref. 1). Within the mucosal tissues, B cells respond to cytokines, sometimes in the absence of T-cell help, undergo class switch recombination of their immunoglobulin receptor to IgA, and differentiate to become plasma cells(2). However, IgA-secreting plasma cells probably have additional attributes that are needed for coping with the tremendous bacterial load in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we report that mouse IgA(+) plasma cells also produce the antimicrobial mediators tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and expressmany molecules that are commonly associated with monocyte/granulocytic cell types. The development of iNOS-producing IgA(+) plasma cells can be recapitulated in vitro in the presence of gut stroma, and the acquisition of this multifunctional phenotype in vivo and in vitro relies on microbial co-stimulation. Deletion of TNF-a and iNOS in B-lineage cells resulted in a reduction in IgA production, altered diversification of the gut microbiota and poor clearance of a gut-tropic pathogen. These findings reveal a novel adaptation to maintaining homeostasis in the gut, and extend the repertoire of protective responses exhibited by some B-lineage cells.","[Fritz, Joerg H.; Rojas, Olga Lucia; Simard, Nathalie; McCarthy, Douglas D.; Robertson, Susan J.; Larijani, Mani; Martin, Alberto; Philpott, Dana J.; Paige, Christopher J.; Gommerman, Jennifer L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Immunol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Simard, Nathalie; Paige, Christopher J.] Princess Margaret Hosp, Univ Hlth Network, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Hapfelmeier, Siegfried; McCoy, Kathy D.; Macpherson, Andrew J.] Univ Bern, Dept Klin Forsch Gastroenterol, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Rubino, Stephen; Girardin, Stephen E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Gosselin, Jean] Univ Laval, Dept Mol Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4G2, Canada; [Ivanov, Ivaylo I.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Casellas, Rafael] NIAMSD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Gommerman, JL (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Immunol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",jen.gommerman@utoronto.ca,"Hapfelmeier, Siegfried/B-6005-2011","Hapfelmeier, Siegfried/0000-0002-6913-7932","CIHR [9862, 89783, 114972, 67157]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health; NIH [R00 DK085329-02]; CCFA [2388]","We thank D.

Inhibition of NF-kappa B signalling has been observed with various bacterial infections(3,4). The NF-kappa B pathway critically requires multiple ubiquitin-chain signals of different natures(5,6). The question of whether ubiquitin-chain signalling and its specificity in NF-kappa B activation are regulated during infection, and how this regulation takes place, has not been explored. Here we show that human TAB2 and TAB3, ubiquitin-chain sensory proteins involved in NF-kappa B signalling, are directly inactivated by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli NleE, a conserved bacterial type-III-secreted effector responsible for blocking host NF-kappa B signalling. NleE harboured an unprecedented S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activity that specifically modified a zinc-coordinating cysteine in the Npl4 zinc finger ( NZF) domains in TAB2 and TAB3. Cysteine-methylated TAB2-NZF and TAB3-NZF ( truncated proteins only comprising the NZF domain) lost the zinc ion as well as the ubiquitin-chain binding activity. Ectopically expressed or type-III-secretion-system-delivered NleE methylated TAB2 and TAB3 in host cells and diminished their ubiquitin-chain binding activity. Replacement of the NZF domain of TAB3 with the NleE methylation-insensitive Npl4 NZF domain resulted in NleE-resistant NF-kappa B activation. Given the prevalence of zinc-finger motifs and activation of cysteine thiol by zinc binding, methylation of zinc-finger cysteine might regulate other eukaryotic pathways in addition to NF-kappa B signalling.","[Zhang, Li; Ding, Xiaojun; Cui, Jixin; Xu, Hao; Chen, Jing; Gong, Yi-Nan; Hu, Liyan; Zhou, Yan; Ge, Jianning; Lu, Qiuhe; Liu, Liping; Chen, She; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Grad Program, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China","Shao, F (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",shaofeng@nibs.ac.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Programs) [2010CB835400, 2012CB518700]","We thank I.

Integrin beta TMDs have such conserved basic amino acids. Here we use NMR spectroscopy(7,8) to show that integrin beta(3)(Lys 716) helps determine beta(3) TMD topography. The alpha(IIb)beta(3) TMD structure indicates that precise beta(3) TMD crossing angles enable the assembly of outer and inner membrane 'clasps' that hold the ab TMD together to limit transmembrane signalling(9). Mutation of beta(3)(Lys 716) caused dissociation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) TMDs and integrin activation. To confirm that altered topography of beta(3)(Lys 716) mutants activated alpha(IIb)beta(3), we used directed evolution of beta(3)(K716A) to identify substitutions restoring default state.

The members of this family of enzymes each contain two rotary motors: one that couples ion translocation to rotation and one that couples rotation to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis. During ATP synthesis, ion translocation through the membrane-bound region of the complex causes rotation of a central rotor that drives conformational changes and ATP synthesis in the catalytic region of the complex. There are no structural models available for the intact membrane region of any ion-translocating rotary ATPase. Here we present a 9.7 angstrom resolution map of the H+-driven ATP synthase from Thermus thermophilus obtained by electron cryomicroscopy of single particles in ice. The 600-kilodalton complex has an overall subunit composition of A(3)B(3)CDE(2)FG(2)IL(12). The membrane-bound motor consists of a ring of L subunits and the carboxy-terminal region of subunit I, which are equivalent to the c and a subunits of most other rotary ATPases, respectively. The map shows that the ring contains 12 L subunits(2) and that the I subunit has eight transmembrane helices(3). The L-12 ring and I subunit have a surprisingly small contact area in the middle of the membrane, with helices from the I subunit making contacts with two different L subunits. The transmembrane helices of subunit I form bundles that could serve as half-channels across the membrane, with the first half-channel conducting protons from the periplasm to the L-12 ring and the second half-channel conducting protons from the L-12 ring to the cytoplasm. This structure therefore suggests the mechanism by which a transmembrane proton motive force is converted to rotation in rotary ATPases.","[Lau, Wilson C.

MCC has strong sequence conservation with propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), and their holoenzymes are both 750-kilodalton (kDa) alpha(6)beta(6) dodecamers. Therefore the architecture of the MCC holoenzyme is expected to be highly similar to that of PCC9. Here we report the crystal structures of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCC (PaMCC) holoenzyme, alone and in complex with coenzyme A. Surprisingly, the structures show that the architecture and overall shape of PaMCC are markedly different when compared to PCC. The alpha-subunits show trimeric association in the PaMCC holoenzyme, whereas they have no contacts with each other in PCC. Moreover, the positions of the two domains in the beta-subunit of PaMCC are swapped relative to those in PCC. This structural information establishes a foundation for understanding the disease-causing mutations of MCC and provides new insights into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of biotin-dependent carboxylases. The large structural differences between MCC and PCC also have general implications for the relationship between sequence conservation and structural similarity.","[Huang, Christine S.; Tong, Liang] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ge, Peng; Zhou, Z.

We use this platform to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like macroscopic clock that can be used to sense arsenic via modulation of the oscillatory period.

Here we show that asymmetric antiparallel EmrE exchanges between inward-and outward-facing states that are identical except that they have opposite orientation in the membrane. We quantitatively measure the global conformational exchange between these two states for substrate-bound EmrE in bicelles using solution NMR dynamics experiments. Forster resonance energy transfer reveals that the monomers within each dimer are antiparallel, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments demonstrate differential water accessibility of the two monomers within each dimer.

With the exception of modest X-ray and infrared flares(6,7), Sgr A* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate and radiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low(3,8). Here we report the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass of Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost radius of approach of only similar to 3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational force. The cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years will probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the supermassive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its fragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.","[Gillessen, S.; Genzel, R.; Fritz, T.

Convection takes place overmuch of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this(1,2). Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected 'mixed modes'(3,4). By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior(1,5,6).","[Beck, Paul G.; Kallinger, Thomas; De Ridder, Joris; Aerts, Conny; Carrier, Fabien; Hillen, Michel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Montalban, Josefina; Dupret, Marc-Antoine; Valentini, Marica] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys Geophys, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Kallinger, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Inst Astron, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Aerts, Conny] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, IMAPP, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Garcia, Rafael A.] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, IRFU Sap, Ctr Saclay,CEA DSM,Lab Astrophys Instrumentat & M, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hekker, Saskia] Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hekker, Saskia; Elsworth, Yvonne; Miglio, Andrea] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Mosser, Benoit] Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Observ Paris,Lab Etudes Spatiales & Instrumentat, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Eggenberger, Patrick] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneve, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Stello, Dennis; Bedding, Timothy R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney Inst Astron SIfA, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Frandsen, Soren; Christensen-Dalsgaard, Jorgen; Kjeldsen, Hans] Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Gruberbauer, Michael] St Marys Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Girouard, Forrest R.; Hall, Jennifer R.; Ibrahim, Khadeejah A.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Orbital Sci Corp, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA","Beck, PG (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",paul.beck@ster.kuleuven.be,,"Kallinger, Thomas/0000-0003-3627-2561; Hillen, Michel/0000-0001-9086-4766; Bedding, Timothy/0000-0001-5943-1460; Bedding, Tim/0000-0001-5222-4661; Garcia, Rafael/0000-0002-8854-3776","NASA's Science Mission Directorate; European Community; Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; Belgian Science Policy Office","We acknowledge the work of the team behind Kepler.

It has lakes in polar regions(1,2), preferentially in the north(3); dry low latitudes with fluvial features(4,5) and occasional rainstorms(6,7); and tropospheric clouds mainly (so far) in southern middle latitudes and polar regions(8-15). Previous models have explained the low-latitude dryness as a result of atmospheric methane transport into middle and high latitudes(16). Hitherto, no model has explained why lakes are found only in polar regions and preferentially in the north; how low-latitude rainstorms arise; or why clouds cluster in southern middle and high latitudes. Here we report simulations with a three-dimensional atmospheric model coupled to a dynamic surface reservoir of methane. We find that methane is cold-trapped and accumulates in polar regions, preferentially in the north because the northern summer, at aphelion, is longer and has greater net precipitation than the southern summer. The net precipitation in polar regions is balanced in the annual mean by slow along-surface methane transport towards mid-latitudes, and subsequent evaporation. In low latitudes, rare but intense storms occur around the equinoxes, producing enough precipitation to carve surface features. Tropospheric clouds form primarily in middle and high latitudes of the summer hemisphere, which until recently has been the southern hemisphere. We predict that in the northern polar region, prominent clouds will form within about two (Earth) years and lake levels will rise over the next fifteen years.","[Schneider, T.; Graves, S. D.

To achieve spatial cloaking, the index of refraction is manipulated to flow light from a probe around an object in such a way that a 'hole' in space is created, and the object remains hidden(3-14). Alternatively, it may be desirable to cloak the occurrence of an event over a finite time period, and the idea of temporal cloaking has been proposed in which the dispersion of the material is manipulated in time, producing a 'time hole' in the probe beam to hide the occurrence of the event from the observer(15). This approach is based on accelerating the front part of a probe light beam and slowing down its rear part to create a well controlled temporal gap-inside which an event occurs-such that the probe beam is not modified in any way by the event. The probe beam is then restored to its original form by the reverse manipulation of the dispersion. Here we present an experimental demonstration of temporal cloaking in an optical fibre-based system by applying concepts from the space-time duality between diffraction and dispersive broadening(16). We characterize the performance of our temporal cloak by detecting the spectral modification of a probe beam due to an optical interaction and show that the amplitude of the event (at the picosecond timescale) is reduced by more than an order of magnitude when the cloak is turned on. These results are a significant step towards the development of full spatio-temporal cloaking.","[Fridman, Moti; Farsi, Alessandro; Okawachi, Yoshitomo; Gaeta, Alexander L.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Gaeta, AL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",alg3@cornell.edu,,"Farsi, Alessandro/0000-0001-8305-1652; fridman, moti/0000-0002-8883-9964","Defence Advanced Research Project Agency; Center for Nanoscale Systems; National Science Foundation for Science, Technology, and Innovation (NYSTAR)","We thank D.

By then, the Arctic Ocean might have gained four times as much fresh water as comprised the Great Salinity Anomaly(4,5) of the 1970s, raising the spectre of slowing global ocean circulation(6). Freshening has been attributed to increased sea ice melting(1) and contributions from runoff(7), but a leading explanation has been a strengthening of the Beaufort High-a characteristic peak in sea level atmospheric pressure(2,8)-which tends to accelerate an anticyclonic (clockwise) wind pattern causing convergence of fresh surface water. Limited observations have made this explanation difficult to verify, and observations of increasing freshwater content under a weakened Beaufort High suggest that other factors(2) must be affecting freshwater content. Here we use observations to show that during a time of record reductions in ice extent from 2005 to 2008, the dominant freshwater content changes were an increase in the Canada basin balanced by a decrease in the Eurasian basin. Observations are drawn from satellite data (sea surface height and ocean-bottom pressure) and in situ data. The freshwater changes were due to a cyclonic (anticlockwise) shift in the ocean pathway of Eurasian runoff forced by strengthening of the west-to-east Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation characterized by an increased Arctic Oscillation(9) index. Our results confirm that runoff is an important influence on the Arctic Ocean and establish that the spatial and temporal manifestations of the runoff pathways are modulated by the Arctic Oscillation, rather than the strength of the wind-driven Beaufort Gyre circulation.","[Morison, James; Peralta-Ferriz, Cecilia; Alkire, Matt; Rigor, Ignatius; Andersen, Roger; Steele, Mike] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Kwok, Ron] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Morison, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",morison@apl.washington.edu,"Kwok, Ron/A-9762-2008","Kwok, Ron/0000-0003-4051-5896","NSF [OPP 0352754]; NASA [NNX08AH62G]; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; NASA MEASURES;  [ARC-0634226];  [ARC-0856330]","This work was supported chiefly by NSF grants OPP 0352754, ARC-0634226, ARC-0856330 and NASA grant NNX08AH62G.

Mechanistic investigations start with the identification of the molecular drug targets. Cocaine, for example, exerts its reinforcing(2) and early neuroadaptive effects(3) by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, thus causing a strong increase in mesolimbic dopamine. Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens(4) is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation(5) as well as in several behavioural adaptations(6-8). A causal link between drug-evoked plasticity at identified synapses and behavioural adaptations, however, is missing, and the benefits of restoring baseline transmission have yet to be demonstrated. Here we find that cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in D1-receptor-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) in mice via ERK signalling with a time course that parallels locomotor sensitization. Depotentiation of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs by optogenetic stimulation in vivo efficiently restored normal transmission and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings establish synaptic potentiation selectively in D1R-MSNs as a mechanism underlying a core component of addiction, probably by creating an imbalance between distinct populations of MSNs in the nucleus accumbens. Our data also provide proof of principle that reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity can treat behavioural alterations caused by addictive drugs and may inspire novel therapeutic approaches involving deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation.","[Pascoli, Vincent; Turiault, Marc; Luescher, Christian] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Clin Neurol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Luscher, C (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",christian.luscher@unige.ch,"Luscher, Christian/A-2496-2011","Luscher, Christian/0000-0001-7917-4596","Swiss National Science Foundation; ""Synapsy"", a National Competence Center in Research (NCCR) of the Swiss Confederation on the synaptic basis of mental disorders","We thank P.

This discrimination is particularly essential when evaluating whether a stimulus is noxious or innocuous. From insects to humans, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are key transducers of thermal, chemical and other sensory cues(1,2). Many TRPs are multimodal receptors that respond to diverse stimuli(1-3), but how animals distinguish sensory inputs activating the same TRP is largely unknown. Here we determine how stimuli activating Drosophila TRPA1 are discriminated. Although Drosophila TRPA1 responds to both noxious chemicals(4) and innocuous warming(5), we find that TRPA1-expressing chemosensory neurons respond to chemicals but not warmth, a specificity conferred by a chemosensory-specific TRPA1 isoform with reduced thermosensitivity compared to the previously described isoform. At the molecular level, this reduction results from a unique region that robustly reduces the channel's thermosensitivity. Cell-type segregation of TRPA1 activity is critical: when the thermosensory isoform is expressed in chemosensors, flies respond to innocuous warming with regurgitation, a nocifensive response. TRPA1 isoform diversity is conserved in malaria mosquitoes, indicating that similar mechanisms may allow discrimination of host-derived warmth-an attractant-from chemical repellents. These findings indicate that reducing thermosensitivity can be critical for TRP channel functional diversification, facilitating their use in contexts in which thermal sensitivity can be maladaptive.","[Kang, Kyeongjin; Panzano, Vincent C.; Chang, Elaine C.; Ni, Lina; Dainis, Alexandra M.; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Kang, Kyeongjin; Panzano, Vincent C.; Chang, Elaine C.; Ni, Lina; Dainis, Alexandra M.; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Jenkins, Adam M.; Regna, Kimberly; Muskavitch, Marc A.

Recently, however, numerous antibodies have been identified that are capable of neutralizing most circulating HIV strains(1-5). These antibodies all exhibit an unusually high level of somatic mutation(6), presumably owing to extensive affinity maturation over the course of continuous exposure to an evolving antigen(7). Although substantial effort has focused on the design of immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies de novo that would target similar epitopes(8-10), it remains uncertain whether a conventional vaccine will be able to elicit analogues of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. As an alternative to immunization, vector-mediated gene transfer could be used to engineer secretion of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies into the circulation. Here we describe a practical implementation of this approach, which we call vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP), which in mice induces lifelong expression of these monoclonal antibodies at high concentrations from a single intramuscular injection. This is achieved using a specialized adeno-associated virus vector optimized for the production of full-length antibody from muscle tissue. We show that humanized mice receiving VIP appear to be fully protected from HIV infection, even when challenged intravenously with very high doses of replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that successful translation of this approach to humans may produce effective prophylaxis against HIV.","[Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rao, Dinesh S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Baltimore, D (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",baltimo@caltech.edu,,"Rao, Dinesh/0000-0002-0794-9337",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative [37866]; National Institutes of Health through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) [HHSN266200500035C]; Joint Center for Translational Medicine; amfAR [107756-47-RFVA]; National Institutes of Health [1K08CA133521],"We thank J.

The development of metastasis is a multistage process with several rate-limiting steps(1). Although dissemination of tumour cells seems to be an early and frequent event(2), the successful initiation of metastatic growth, a process termed 'metastatic colonization', is inefficient for many cancer types and is accomplished only by a minority of cancer cells that reach distant sites(3,4). Prevalent target sites are characteristic of many tumour entities(5), suggesting that inadequate support by distant tissues contributes to the inefficiency of the metastatic process. Here we show that a small population of cancer stem cells is critical for metastatic colonization, that is, the initial expansion of cancer cells at the secondary site, and that stromal niche signals are crucial to this expansion process. We find that periostin (POSTN), a component of the extracellular matrix, is expressed by fibroblasts in the normal tissue and in the stroma of the primary tumour. Infiltrating tumour cells need to induce stromal POSTN expression in the secondary target organ (in this case lung) to initiate colonization. POSTN is required to allow cancer stem cell maintenance, and blocking its function prevents metastasis. POSTN recruits Wnt ligands and thereby increases Wnt signalling in cancer stem cells. We suggest that the education of stromal cells by infiltrating tumour cells is an important step in metastatic colonization and that preventing de novo niche formation may be a novel strategy for the treatment of metastatic disease.","[Malanchi, Ilaria; Santamaria-Martinez, Albert; Susanto, Evelyn; Peng, Hong; Huelsken, Joerg] Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Malanchi, Ilaria; Santamaria-Martinez, Albert; Susanto, Evelyn; Peng, Hong; Huelsken, Joerg] Natl Ctr Competence Res Mol Oncol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Peng, Hong] So Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lehr, Hans-Anton] Univ Lausanne, CHUV, Univ Inst Pathol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Delaloye, Jean-Francois] CHU Vaudois, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland","Huelsken, J (reprint author), Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",joerg.huelsken@epfl.ch,,,Swiss League against Cancer; SNF; NCCR in Molecular Oncology; Anna Fuller Fund; Debiopharm,"We are grateful to U.

By binding specific DNA sequences, BCL6 controls the transcription of a variety of genes involved in B-cell development, differentiation and activation. BCL6 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoma in adulthood, and transgenic mice constitutively expressing BCL6 in B cells develop DLBCLs similar to the human disease(3,4). In many DLBCL patients, BCL6 overexpression is achieved through translocation (similar to 40%) or hypermutation of its promoter (similar to 15%). However, many other DLBCLs overexpress BCL6 through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that BCL6 is targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation by a SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that contains the orphan F-box protein FBXO11 (refs 5, 6). The gene encoding FBXO11 was found to be deleted or mutated in multiple DLBCL cell lines, and this inactivation of FBXO11 correlated with increased levels and stability of BCL6. Similarly, FBXO11 was either deleted or mutated in primary DLBCLs. Notably, tumour-derived FBXO11 mutants displayed an impaired ability to induce BCL6 degradation. Reconstitution of FBXO11 expression in FBXO11-deleted DLBCL cells promoted BCL6 ubiquitylation and degradation, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced cell death. FBXO11-deleted DLBCL cells generated tumours in immunodeficient mice, and the tumorigenicity was suppressed by FBXO11 reconstitution. We reveal a molecular mechanism controlling BCL6 stability and propose that mutations and deletions in FBXO11 contribute to lymphomagenesis through BCL6 stabilization. The deletions/mutations found in DLBCLs are largely monoallelic, indicating that FBXO11 is a haplo-insufficient tumour suppressor gene.","[Duan, Shanshan; Cermak, Lukas; Pagan, Julia K.; Rossi, Mario; Pagano, Michele] NYU, Sch Med, NYU Canc Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Duan, Shanshan; Cermak, Lukas; Pagan, Julia K.; Pagano, Michele] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Martinengo, Cinzia; Chiarle, Roberto] Univ Turin, CERMS, Dept Biomed Sci & Human Oncol, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [di Celle, Paola Francia] San Giovanni Battista Hosp, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Chapuy, Bjoern; Shipp, Margaret] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Pagano, M (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, NYU Canc Inst, Dept Pathol, 522 1st Ave,SRB 1107, New York, NY 10016 USA.",roberto.chiarle@unito.it; michele.pagano@nyumc.org,"Rossi, Mario/E-7666-2012; Cermak, Lukas/N-2254-2016","Rossi, Mario/0000-0001-6349-8895; Cermak, Lukas/0000-0002-8777-3692; pagano, michele/0000-0003-3210-2442; CHIARLE, Roberto/0000-0003-1564-8531; Pagan, Julia/0000-0002-7079-6388","National Institutes of Health [R01-GM57587, R37-CA76584, R21-CA161108, PO1-CA092625]; Susan G.

Like other voltage-dependent K+ channels, Ca2+-activated K+ channels open when the cell membrane depolarizes, but in contrast to other voltage-dependent K+ channels, they also open when intracellular Ca2+ concentrations rise. Channel opening by Ca2+ is made possible by a structure called the gating ring, which is located in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have defined the Ca2+-free, closed, conformation of the gating ring, but the Ca2+-bound, open, conformation is not yet known(9). Here we present the Ca2+-bound conformation of the gating ring. This structure shows how one layer of the gating ring, in response to the binding of Ca2+, opens like the petals of a flower. The degree to which it opens explains how Ca2+ binding can open the transmembrane pore.

The enzyme activating methane in methanotrophic archaea has tentatively been identified as a homologue of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) that catalyses the methane-forming step in methanogenic archaea(3,4). Here we report an X-ray structure of the 280 kDa heterohexameric ANME-1 MCR complex. It was crystallized uniquely from a protein ensemble purified from consortia of microorganisms collected with a submersible from a Black Sea mat catalysing AOM with sulphate(4). Crystals grown from the heterogeneous sample diffract to 2.1 angstrom resolution and consist of a single ANME-1MCR population, demonstrating the strong selective power of crystallization. The structure revealed ANME-1 MCR in complex with coenzyme M and coenzyme B, indicating the same substrates for MCR from methanotrophic and methanogenic archaea. Differences between the highly similar structures of ANME-1MCR and methanogenic MCR include a F-430 modification, a cysteine-rich patch and an altered post-translational amino acid modification pattern, which may tune the enzymes for their functions in different biological contexts.","[Shima, Seigo; Kahnt, Joerg; Thauer, Rudolf K.] Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Shima, Seigo] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Krueger, Martin] Fed Inst Geosci & Resources, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Weinert, Tobias; Demmer, Ulrike; Ermler, Ulrich] Max Planck Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Shima, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Karl von Frisch Str 10, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",shima@mpi-marburg.mpg.de; ulrich.ermler@biophys.mpg.de,"Weinert, Tobias/I-4813-2013; Weinert, Tobias/J-6353-2017","Weinert, Tobias/0000-0002-0339-3722; Weinert, Tobias/0000-0002-0339-3722","Max Planck Society; Fonds der Chemischen Industrie; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP 1319, ER 222/5-1, KR 3311/6-2]; MUMM; BEBOP; University of Hamburg; PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","This work was supported by the Max Planck Society, the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SPP 1319, ER 222/5-1, KR 3311/6-2) and the projects MUMM, and BEBOP (Biogeochemistry and Microbiology of Bioherms Prospering in the Black Sea funded by the University of Hamburg).

To gain insights into this process, we generated base-pair-resolution mouse methylomes in stem cells and neuronal progenitors. Advanced quantitative analysis identified low-methylated regions (LMRs) with an average methylation of 30%. These represent CpG-poor distal regulatory regions as evidenced by location, DNase I hypersensitivity, presence of enhancer chromatin marks and enhancer activity in reporter assays. LMRs are occupied by DNA-binding factors and their binding is necessary and sufficient to create LMRs. A comparison of neuronal and stem-cell methylomes confirms this dependency, as cell-type-specific LMRs are occupied by cell-type-specific transcription factors. This study provides methylome references for the mouse and shows that DNA-binding factors locally influence DNA methylation, enabling the identification of active regulatory regions.","[Stadler, Michael B.; Murr, Rabih; Burger, Lukas; Ivanek, Robert; Lienert, Florian; Schoeler, Anne; Wirbelauer, Christiane; Gaidatzis, Dimos; Tiwari, Vijay K.; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Stadler, Michael B.; Burger, Lukas; Schoeler, Anne; Gaidatzis, Dimos] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Lienert, Florian; Schoeler, Anne; Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Oakeley, Edward J.] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Schubeler, D (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",dirk@fmi.ch,"Ivanek, Robert/A-8852-2008","Murr, Rabih/0000-0002-3346-6590; van Nimwegen, Erik/0000-0001-6338-1312",EMBO; Marie Curie International Incoming fellowship; Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE) [FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Research Council (ERC EpiGePlas); SNF; Swiss initiative in Systems Biology,"The authors thank A.

Previous observations have revealed the existence of post-red-giant host stars with giant planets(2-4) orbiting as close as 0.116 AU or with brown dwarf companions(5,6) in tight orbits, showing that these bodies can survive engulfment. What has remained unclear is whether planets can be dragged deeper into the red-giant envelope without being disrupted and whether the evolution of the parent star itself could be affected(7-9). Here we report the presence of two nearly Earth-sized bodies orbiting the post-red-giant, hot B subdwarf star KIC 05807616 at distances of 0.0060 and 0.0076 AU, with orbital periods of 5.7625 and 8.2293 hours, respectively. These bodies probably survived deep immersion in the former red-giant envelope. They may be the dense cores of evaporated giant planets that were transported closer to the star during the engulfment and triggered the mass loss necessary for the formation of the hot B subdwarf, which might also explain how some stars of this type did not form in binary systems.","[Charpinet, S.] Univ Toulouse, UPS OMP, IRAP, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Charpinet, S.] CNRS, IRAP, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Fontaine, G.; Brassard, P.] Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Green, E.

Blockade phenomena reveal the underlying granular nature of quantum systems and allow for the detection and manipulation of the constituent particles, be they electrons(1), spins(2), atoms(3-5) or photons(6). Applications include single-electron transistors based on electronic Coulomb blockade(7) and quantum logic gates in Rydberg atoms(8,9). Here we report a form of interaction blockade that occurs when transferring ultracold atoms between orbitals in an optical lattice. We call this orbital excitation blockade (OEB). In this system, atoms at the same lattice site undergo coherent collisions described by a contact interaction whose strength depends strongly on the orbital wavefunctions of the atoms. We induce coherent orbital excitations by modulating the lattice depth, and observe staircase-like excitation behaviour as we cross the interaction-split resonances by tuning the modulation frequency. As an application of OEB, we demonstrate algorithmic cooling(10,11) of quantum gases: a sequence of reversible OEB-based quantum operations isolates the entropy in one part of the system and then an irreversible step removes the entropy from the gas. This technique may make it possible to cool quantum gases to have the ultralow entropies required for quantum simulation(12,13) of strongly correlated electron systems. In addition, the close analogy between OEB and dipole blockade in Rydberg atoms provides a plan for the implementation of two-quantum-bit gates(14) in a quantum computing architecture with natural scalability.","[Bakr, Waseem S.; Preiss, Philipp M.; Tai, M.

But to realize such applications, the charge carrier mobilities of solution-processed organic semiconductors must be improved. For inorganic semiconductors, a general method of increasing charge carrier mobility is to introduce strain within the crystal lattice(6). Here we describe a solution-processing technique for organic semiconductors in which lattice strain is used to increase charge carrier mobilities by introducing greater electron orbital overlap between the component molecules. For organic semiconductors, the spacing between cofacially stacked, conjugated backbones (the pi-pi stacking distance) greatly influences electron orbital overlap and therefore mobility(7). Using our method to incrementally introduce lattice strain, we alter the pi-pi stacking distance of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) from 3.33 angstrom to 3.08 angstrom. We believe that 3.08 angstrom is the shortest pi-pi stacking distance that has been achieved in an organic semiconductor crystal lattice (although a pi-pi distance of 3.04 angstrom has been achieved through intramolecular bonding(8-10)). The positive charge carrier (hole) mobility in TIPS-pentacene transistors increased from 0.8 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for unstrained films to a high mobility of 4.6 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for a strained film. Using solution processing to modify molecular packing through lattice strain should aid the development of high-performance, low-cost organic semiconducting devices.","[Giri, Gaurav; Verploegen, Eric; Kim, Do Hwan; Bao, Zhenan] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Verploegen, Eric; Mannsfeld, Stefan C.

In particular, the relative importance of atmospheric and oceanic processes is not firmly established(1-5). Southward shifts of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) driven by high-latitude climate changes have been suggested as a primary forcing(2,3), whereas other studies infer a predominant influence of Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures on regional rainfall changes(4,5). To address this question, a continuous record representing an integrated signal of regional climate variability is required, but has until now been missing. Here we show that remote atmospheric forcing by cold events in the northern high latitudes appears to have been the main driver of hydro-climatology in southeast Africa during rapid climate changes over the past 17,000 years. Our results are based on a reconstruction of precipitation and river discharge changes, as recorded in a marine sediment core off the mouth of the Zambezi River, near the southern boundary of the modern seasonal ITCZ migration. Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures did not exert a primary control over southeast African hydrologic variability. Instead, phases of high precipitation and terrestrial discharge occurred when the ITCZ was forced southwards during Northern Hemisphere cold events, such as Heinrich stadial 1 (around 16,000 years ago) and the Younger Dryas (around 12,000 years ago), or when local summer insolation was high in the late Holocene, that is, during the past 4,000 years.","[Schefuss, Enno; Kuhlmann, Holger; Mollenhauer, Gesine; Prange, Matthias; Paetzold, Juergen] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schefuss, Enno; Kuhlmann, Holger; Mollenhauer, Gesine; Prange, Matthias; Paetzold, Juergen] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Mollenhauer, Gesine] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany","Schefuss, E (reprint author), Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",schefuss@uni-bremen.de,"Mollenhauer, Gesine/B-5190-2015; SchefuSS, Enno/A-7101-2015","Mollenhauer, Gesine/0000-0001-5138-564X; SchefuSS, Enno/0000-0002-5960-930X; Kuhlmann, Holger/0000-0001-8932-7031; Patzold, Jurgen/0000-0001-8074-4103",DFG Research Center/Cluster of Excellence 'The Ocean in the Earth System'; DFG [Sche903/8],"This work was supported by the DFG Research Center/Cluster of Excellence 'The Ocean in the Earth System' and DFG grant Sche903/8.

In the Late Jurassic-aged Morrison depositional basin of western North America, these animals occupied lowland river-floodplain settings characterized by a seasonally dry climate(1,2). Massive herbivores with high nutritional and water needs could periodically experience nutritional and water stress under these conditions, and thus the common occurrence of sauropods in this basin has remained a paradox. Energetic arguments and mammalian analogues have been used to suggest that migration allowed sauropods access to food and water resources over a wide region or during times of drought or both(3,4), but there has been no direct support for these hypotheses. Here we compare oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of tooth-enamel carbonate from the sauropod Camarasaurus with those of ancient soil, lake and wetland (that is, 'authigenic') carbonates that formed in lowland settings. We demonstrate that certain populations of these animals did in fact undertake seasonal migrations of several hundred kilometres from lowland to upland environments. This ability to describe patterns of sauropod movement will help to elucidate the role that migration played in the ecology and evolution of gigantism of these and associated dinosaurs.","[Fricke, Henry C.; Hencecroth, Justin; Hoerner, Marie E.] Colorado Coll, Dept Geol, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA","Fricke, HC (reprint author), Colorado Coll, Dept Geol, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA.",hfricke@coloradocollege.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [EAR-0319041, EAR 0923831]; Colorado College","We thank S.

The causes of these declines are a matter of continued research, but probably include climate change, land-use change and spread of the pathogenic fungal disease chytridiomycosis(1,4,5). Here we assess the spatial distribution and interactions of these primary threats in relation to the global distribution of amphibian species. We show that the greatest proportions of species negatively affected by climate change are projected to be found in Africa, parts of northern South America and the Andes. Regions with the highest projected impact of land-use and climate change coincide, but there is little spatial overlap with regions highly threatened by the fungal disease. Overall, the areas harbouring the richest amphibian faunas are disproportionately more affected by one or multiple threat factors than areas with low richness. Amphibian declines are likely to accelerate in the twenty-first century, because multiple drivers of extinction could jeopardize their populations more than previous, mono-causal, assessments have suggested.","[Hof, Christian; Araujo, Miguel B.; Rahbek, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Hof, Christian; Araujo, Miguel B.] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Araujo, Miguel B.] Univ Evora, CIBIO, Rui Nabeiro Biodivers Chair, P-7000 Evora, Portugal; [Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Hof, C (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",christian.hof@senckenberg.de,"Rahbek, Carsten/D-9372-2013; Rahbek, Carsten/L-1129-2013; Hof, Christian/J-8888-2014; Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012; publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017","Hof, Christian/0000-0002-7763-1885; Araujo, Miguel/0000-0002-5107-7265; ","Danish National Research Foundation; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/AAC-AMB/98163/2008]; NSF [DBI 0960550, DEB 1026764]","We are grateful to D.

Legumes belong to one of the two main groups of eurosids, the Fabidae, which includes most species capable of endosymbiotic nitrogen fixation(1). Legumes comprise several evolutionary lineages derived from a common ancestor 60 million years ago (Myr ago). Papilionoids are the largest clade, dating nearly to the origin of legumes and containing most cultivated species(2). Medicago truncatula is a long-established model for the study of legume biology. Here we describe the draft sequence of the M. truncatula euchromatin based on a recently completed BAC assembly supplemented with Illumina shotgun sequence, together capturing similar to 94% of all M. truncatula genes. A whole-genome duplication (WGD) approximately 58 Myr ago had a major role in shaping the M. truncatula genome and thereby contributed to the evolution of endosymbiotic nitrogen fixation. Subsequent to the WGD, the M. truncatula genome experienced higher levels of rearrangement than two other sequenced legumes, Glycine max and Lotus japonicus. M. truncatula is a close relative of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a widely cultivated crop with limited genomics tools and complex autotetraploid genetics. As such, the M. truncatula genome sequence provides significant opportunities to expand alfalfa's genomic toolbox.","[Young, Nevin D.; Zhou, Peng; Denny, Roxanne; Paule, Charles R.; Wang, Bing-Bing; Wang, Xiaohong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Pathol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Young, Nevin D.; Zhou, Peng; Denny, Roxanne; Paule, Charles R.; Wang, Bing-Bing; Wang, Xiaohong] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Debelle, Frederic; Gouzy, Jerome; Bardou, Philippe; Dudez, Anne-Marie; Gibelin, Chrystel; Prion, Florent; Sallet, Erika; Samson, Nicolas; Saurat, Olivier; Zuber, Antoine; Denarie, Jean] INRA, LIPM, UMR441, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Debelle, Frederic; Gouzy, Jerome; Bardou, Philippe; Dudez, Anne-Marie; Gibelin, Chrystel; Prion, Florent; Sallet, Erika; Samson, Nicolas; Saurat, Olivier; Zuber, Antoine; Denarie, Jean] CNRS, UMR2594, LIPM, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Oldroyd, Giles E.

The isolation of wild strains of Caenorhabditis elegans has facilitated the study of natural genetic variation in this species(4) and provided insights into its diverse microbial ecology(5). C. elegans responds to bacterial infection with conserved innate immune responses(6-8) and, although lacking the immunological memory of vertebrate adaptive immunity, shows an aversive learning response to pathogenic bacteria(9). Here, we report the molecular characterization of naturally occurring coding polymorphisms in a C. elegans gene encoding a conserved HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, HECW-1. We show that two distinct polymorphisms in neighbouring residues of HECW-1 each affect C. elegans behavioural avoidance of a lawn of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Neuron-specific rescue and ablation experiments and genetic interaction analysis indicate that HECW-1 functions in a pair of sensory neurons to inhibit P. aeruginosa lawn avoidance behaviour through inhibition of the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 (ref. 10), which we have previously shown promotes P. aeruginosa lawn avoidance behaviour(11). Our data establish a molecular basis for natural variation in a C. elegans behaviour that may undergo adaptive changes in response to microbial pathogens.","[Chang, Howard C.; Paek, Jennifer; Kim, Dennis H.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Kim, DH (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dhkim@mit.edu,,,NIH-National Center for Research Resources; NIH [GM084477],"We thank D.

Although it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to infect initially macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1; also called CD150) as a receptor(3-6). These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and transport the infection to lymphatic organs where measles virus replicates vigorously(7). How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. On the basis of functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, here we identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (PVRL4)) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains measles virus entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is downregulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheae. Although other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that measles virus targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer(9-11), which has implications for ongoing measles-virus-based clinical trials of oncolysis(12).","[Mateo, Mathieu; Leonard, Vincent H.

Invasion requires a series of extracellular recognition events between erythrocyte receptors and ligands on the merozoite, the invasive form of the parasite. None of the few known receptor-ligand interactions involved(1-4) are required in all parasite strains, indicating that the parasite is able to access multiple redundant invasion pathways(5). Here, we show that we have identified a receptor-ligand pair that is essential for erythrocyte invasion in all tested P. falciparum strains. By systematically screening a library of erythrocyte proteins, we have found that the Ok blood group antigen, basigin, is a receptor for PfRh5, a parasite ligand that is essential for blood stage growth(6). Erythrocyte invasion was potently inhibited by soluble basigin or by basigin knockdown, and invasion could be completely blocked using low concentrations of anti-basigin antibodies; importantly, these effects were observed across all laboratory-adapted and field strains tested. Furthermore, Ok(a-) erythrocytes, which express a basigin variant that has a weaker binding affinity for PfRh5, had reduced invasion efficiencies. Our discovery of a cross-strain dependency on a single extracellular receptor-ligand pair for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum provides a focus for new anti-malarial therapies.","[Crosnier, Cecile; Bartholdson, S.

The mechanisms by which tissues and the immune system communicate to establish and maintain immune homeostasis are currently unknown. Clinical evidence suggests that chronic or repeated exposure to self antigen within tissues leads to an attenuation of pathological autoimmune responses, possibly as a means to mitigate inflammatory damage and preserve function. Many human organ-specific autoimmune diseases are characterized by the initial presentation of the disease being the most severe, with subsequent flares being of lesser severity and duration(1). In fact, these diseases often spontaneously resolve, despite persistent tissue autoantigen expression(2). In the practice of antigen-specific immunotherapy, allergens or self antigens are repeatedly injected in the skin, with a diminution of the inflammatory response occurring after each successive exposure(3). Although these findings indicate that tissues acquire the ability to attenuate autoimmune reactions upon repeated responses to antigens, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we show that upon expression of self antigen in a peripheral tissue, thymus-derived regulatory T cells (T-reg cells) become activated, proliferate and differentiate into more potent suppressors, which mediate resolution of organ-specific autoimmunity in mice. After resolution of the inflammatory response, activated T-reg cells are maintained in the target tissue and are primed to attenuate subsequent autoimmune reactions when antigen is re-expressed. Thus, T-reg cells function to confer 'regulatory memory' to the target tissue. These findings provide a framework for understanding how T-reg cells respond when exposed to self antigen in peripheral tissues and offer mechanistic insight into how tissues regulate autoimmunity.","[Gratz, Iris K.; Paw, Jonathan S.; Abbas, Abul K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Rosenblum, Michael D.; Paw, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Dermatol, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; [Lee, Karen] Columbia Univ, Dept Pediat, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Marshak-Rothstein, Ann] Univ Massachusetts, Div Rheumatol, Dept Med, Worcester, MA 01655 USA","Abbas, AK (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Abul.Abbas@ucsf.edu,"Gratz, Iris /L-6267-2015","Gratz, Iris /0000-0001-7470-7277","Dermatology Foundation; UCSF Department of Dermatology; NIH [P01 AI35297, R01 AI73656, U19 AI56388, AR055634]; Scleroderma Research Foundation; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J2997-B13]","We thank C.

Proteolytic liberation of highly aggregation-prone polyQ fragments from the protective sequence of the MJD1 gene product ataxin 3 (ATXN3) has been proposed to trigger the formation of ATXN3-containing aggregates, the neuropathological hallmark of MJD(1-5). ATXN3 fragments are detected in brain tissue of MJD patients and transgenic mice expressing mutant human ATXN3(Q71)(6), and their amount increases with disease severity, supporting a relationship between ATXN3 processing and disease progression. The formation of early aggregation intermediates is thought to have a critical role in disease initiation(7,8), but the precise pathogenic mechanism operating in MJD has remained elusive(9). Here we show that L-glutamate-induced excitation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons initiates Ca2+-dependent proteolysis of ATXN3 followed by the formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates. This phenotype could be abolished by calpain inhibition, confirming a key role of this protease in ATXN3 aggregation. Aggregate formation was further dependent on functional Na+ and K+ channels as well as ionotropic and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and was not observed in iPSCs, fibroblasts or glia, thereby providing an explanation for the neuron-specific phenotype of this disease. Our data illustrate that iPSCs enable the study of aberrant protein processing associated with late-onset neurodegenerative disorders in patient-specific neurons.","[Koch, Philipp; Peitz, Michael; Jungverdorben, Johannes; Kesavan, Jaideep; Poppe, Daniel; Doerr, Jonas; Ladewig, Julia; Mertens, Jerome; Bruestle, Oliver] Univ Bonn, Inst Reconstruct Neurobiol, Life & Brain Ctr, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Koch, Philipp; Peitz, Michael; Jungverdorben, Johannes; Kesavan, Jaideep; Poppe, Daniel; Doerr, Jonas; Ladewig, Julia; Mertens, Jerome; Bruestle, Oliver] Hertie Fdn, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Breuer, Peter; Klockgether, Thomas; Evert, Bernd O.; Wuellner, Ullrich] Univ Bonn, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Tueting, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Med Ctr, Dept Dermatol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Hoffmann, Per] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Human Genet, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Hoffmann, Per] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Dept Genom, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Klockgether, Thomas] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, DZNE, D-53175 Bonn, Germany","Brustle, O (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Inst Reconstruct Neurobiol, Life & Brain Ctr, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.",brustle@uni-bonn.de,"Mertens, Jerome/P-1931-2015; Koch, Philipp/M-1186-2016","Mertens, Jerome/0000-0002-4291-4121; Koch, Philipp/0000-0003-3713-8786; Poppe, Daniel/0000-0002-6674-8420; Hoffmann, Per/0000-0002-6573-983X","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01GNO813, 01GS0860]; European Union [LSHG-CT-2006-018739, HEALTH-F5-2010-266753]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [WU 184/6-1, EV143/1-1]; BONFOR; Hertie Foundation","We thank S.

Directed differentiation of PSCs into specialized cells such as spinal motoneurons(1) or midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons(2) has been achieved. However, the effective use of PSCs for cell therapy has lagged behind. Whereas mouse PSC-derived DA neurons have shown efficacy in models of Parkinson's disease(3,4), DA neurons from human PSCs generally show poor in vivo performance(5). There are also considerable safety concerns for PSCs related to their potential for teratoma formation or neural overgrowth(6,7). Here we present a novel floor-plate-based strategy for the derivation of human DA neurons that efficiently engraft in vivo, suggesting that past failures were due to incomplete specification rather than a specific vulnerability of the cells. Midbrain floor-plate precursors are derived from PSCs 11 days after exposure to small molecule activators of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and canonical WNT signalling. Engraftable midbrain DA neurons are obtained by day 25 and can be maintained in vitro for several months. Extensive molecular profiling, biochemical and electrophysiological data define developmental progression and confirm identity of PSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. In vivo survival and function is demonstrated in Parkinson's disease models using three host species. Long-term engraftment in 6-hydroxy-dopamine-lesioned mice and rats demonstrates robust survival of midbrain DA neurons derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells, complete restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behaviour and improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia. Finally, scalability is demonstrated by transplantation into parkinsonian monkeys. Excellent DA neuron survival, function and lack of neural overgrowth in the three animal models indicate promise for the development of cell-based therapies in Parkinson's disease.","[Kriks, Sonja; Shim, Jae-Won; Piao, Jinghua; Ganat, Yosif M.; Auyeung, Gordon; Antonacci, Chris; Buch, Amanda; Tabar, Viviane; Studer, Lorenz] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kriks, Sonja; Shim, Jae-Won; Ganat, Yosif M.; Studer, Lorenz] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Piao, Jinghua; Auyeung, Gordon; Antonacci, Chris; Buch, Amanda; Tabar, Viviane; Studer, Lorenz] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wakeman, Dustin R.; Kordower, Jeffrey H.] Rush Univ, Dept Neurol Sci, Med Ctr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Xie, Zhong; Carrillo-Reid, Luis; Surmeier, D.

However, mechanisms that logically explain the coordination of nuclear hormone receptors and the clock are poorly understood. Here we show that two circadian co-regulators, cryptochromes 1 and 2, interact with the glucocorticoid receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote repression. In mice, genetic loss of cryptochrome 1 and/or 2 results in glucose intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, cryptochromes 1 and 2 associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 promoter in a hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers. These results reveal a specific mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal metabolic homeostasis.","[Lamia, Katja A.; Yu, Ruth T.; Barish, Grant D.; Uhlenhaut, N.

These histone modifications are reversible, dynamic events that can regulate DNA-driven cellular processes(3,4). However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate histone modification patterns remain largely unknown. In metazoans, reversible protein modification by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is catalysed by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA)(5,6). However, the significance of GlcNAcylation in chromatin reorganization remains elusive. Here we report that histone H2B is GlcNAcylated at residue S112 by OGT in vitro and in living cells. Histone GlcNAcylation fluctuated in response to extracellular glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP)(5,6). H2B S112 GlcNAcylation promotes K120 monoubiquitination, in which the GlcNAc moiety can serve as an anchor for a histone H2B ubiquitin ligase. H2B S112 GlcNAc was localized to euchromatic areas on fly polytene chromosomes. In a genome-wide analysis, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation sites were observed widely distributed over chromosomes including transcribed gene loci, with some sites co-localizing with H2B K120 monoubiquitination. These findings suggest that H2B S112 GlcNAcylation is a histone modification that facilitates H2BK120 monoubiquitination, presumably for transcriptional activation.","[Fujiki, Ryoji; Hashiba, Waka; Sekine, Hiroki; Yokoyama, Atsushi; Chikanishi, Toshihiro; Ito, Saya; Imai, Yuuki; Ohtake, Fumiaki; Kitagawa, Hirochika; Kato, Shigeaki] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Kim, Jaehoon; Roeder, Robert G.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Biochem & Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [He, Housheng Hansen; Brown, Myles] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [He, Housheng Hansen; Brown, Myles] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Igarashi, Katsuhide; Kanno, Jun] Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Cellular & Mol Toxicol, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1588501, Japan; [Kato, Shigeaki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Kato, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",uskato@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"He, Housheng/G-9614-2011","Kim, Jaehoon/0000-0003-4035-0438; Brown, Myles/0000-0002-8213-1658","Naito Foundation; Astellas foundation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank A.

Pol is expressed exclusively as a Gag-Pol fusion either by ribosomal frameshifting or by read-through of the gag stop codon(3). Both of these mechanisms occur infrequently and only affect 5-10% of translating ribosomes, allowing the virus to maintain the critical Gag to Gag-Pol ratio(4-8). Although it is understood that the frequency of the recoding event is regulated by cis RNA motifs, no mechanistic explanation is currently available for how the critical protein ratio is maintained. Here we present the NMR structure of the murine leukaemia virus recoding signal and show that a protonation-dependent switch occurs to induce the active conformation. The equilibrium is such that at physiological pH the active, read-through permissive conformation is populated at approximately 6%: a level that correlates with in vivo protein quantities. The RNA functions by a highly sensitive, chemo-mechanical coupling tuned to ensure an optimal read-through frequency. Similar observations for a frameshifting signal indicate that this novel equilibrium-based mechanism may have a general role in translational recoding.","[Durney, Michael A.; Salguero, Carolina; Shankar, Neelaabh; Nagle, Julia M.; D'Souza, Victoria M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Houck-Loomis, Brian; Goff, Stephen P.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","D'Souza, VM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dsouza@mcb.harvard.edu,"Goff, Stephen/K-6337-2014","Goff, Stephen/0000-0003-0693-5547; Shankar, Neelaabh/0000-0001-5983-3152",NCI/NIH [R37 CA30488],"We thank J.

AcrB is a homotrimer that acts as a tripartite complex(9,10) with the outer membrane channel TolC(11,12) and the membrane fusion protein AcrA(13,14). Minocycline and doxorubicin have been shown to bind to the phenylalanine cluster region of the binding monomer(15). Here we report the crystal structures of AcrB bound to the high-molecular-mass drugs rifampicin and erythromycin. These drugs bind to the access monomer, and the binding sites are located in the proximal multisite binding pocket, which is separated from the phenylalanine cluster region (distal pocket) by the Phe-617 loop. Our structures indicate that there are two discrete multisite binding pockets along the intramolecular channel. High-molecular-mass drugs first bind to the proximal pocket in the access state and are then forced into the distal pocket in the binding state by a peristaltic mechanism involving subdomain movements that include a shift of the Phe-617 loop. By contrast, low-molecular-mass drugs, such as minocycline and doxorubicin, travel through the proximal pocket without specific binding and immediately bind to the distal pocket. The presence of two discrete, high-volume multisite binding pockets contributes to the remarkably broad substrate recognition of AcrB.","[Nakashima, Ryosuke; Sakurai, Keisuke; Yamaguchi, Akihito] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Dept Cell Membrane Biol, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Yamasaki, Seiji; Yamaguchi, Akihito] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Nishino, Kunihiko] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Lab Microbiol & Infect Dis, Osaka 5670047, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Dept Cell Membrane Biol, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",akihito@sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Academia Sinica; National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (Taiwan); National Institute of Biomedical Innovation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","We thank T.

In living systems, phosphorus is an integral component of nucleic acids, carbohydrates and phospholipids, where it is incorporated as a derivative of phosphate. However, most Gram-negative bacteria have the capability to use phosphonates as a nutritional source of phosphorus under conditions of phosphate starvation(1). In these organisms, methylphosphonate is converted to phosphate and methane. In a formal sense, this transformation is a hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond, but a general enzymatic mechanism for the activation and conversion of alkylphosphonates to phosphate and an alkane has not been elucidated despite much effort for more than two decades. The actual mechanism for C-P bond cleavage is likely to be a radical-based transformation(2). In Escherichia coli, the catalytic machinery for the C-P lyase reaction has been localized to the phn gene cluster(1). This operon consists of the 14 genes phnC, phnD, ... , phnP. Genetic and biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the genes phnG, phnH, ... , phnM encode proteins that are essential for the conversion of phosphonates to phosphate and that the proteins encoded by the other genes in the operon have auxiliary functions(1,3-6). There are no functional annotations for any of the seven proteins considered essential for C-P bond cleavage. Here we show that methylphosphonate reacts with MgATP to form alpha-D-ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-triphosphate (RPnTP) and adenine. The triphosphate moiety of RPnTP is hydrolysed to pyrophosphate and alpha-D-ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-phosphate (PRPn). The C-P bond of PRPn is subsequently cleaved in a radical-based reaction producing alpha-D-ribose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-5-phosphate and methane in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Substantial quantities of phosphonates are produced worldwide for industrial processes, detergents, herbicides and pharmaceuticals(7-9). Our elucidation of the chemical steps for the biodegradation of alkylphosphonates shows how these compounds can be metabolized and recycled to phosphate.","[Kamat, Siddhesh S.; Williams, Howard J.; Raushel, Frank M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Raushel, FM (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, POB 30012, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",raushel@tamu.edu,"Raushel, Frank/B-7125-2015","Raushel, Frank/0000-0002-5918-3089","National Institutes of Health [GM93342, GM71790]; Robert A.

Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.","[Letzkus, Johannes J.; Wolff, Steffen B.

Human antibodies such as PG9 nonetheless engage V1/V2 and neutralize 80% of HIV-1 isolates. Here we report the structure of V1/V2 in complex with PG9. V1/V2 forms a four-stranded beta-sheet domain, in which sequence diversity and glycosylation are largely segregated to strand-connecting loops. PG9 recognition involves electrostatic, sequence-independent and glycan interactions: the latter account for over half the interactive surface but are of sufficiently weak affinity to avoid autoreactivity. The structures of V1/V2-directed antibodies CH04 and PGT145 indicate that they share a common mode of glycan penetration by extended anionic loops. In addition to structurally defining V1/V2, the results thus identify a paradigm of antibody recognition for highly glycosylated antigens, which-with PG9-involves a site of vulnerability comprising just two glycans and a strand.","[McLellan, Jason S.; Pancera, Marie; Gorman, Jason; Louder, Robert; Sastry, Mallika; Dai, Kaifan; O'Dell, Sijy; Shahzad-ul-Hussan, Syed; Yang, Yongping; Zhang, Baoshan; Zhou, Tongqing; Zhu, Jiang; Boyington, Jeffrey C.; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Georgiev, Ivelin; Do Kwon, Young; Lee, Doyung; Louder, Mark K.; Moquin, Stephanie; Schmidt, Stephen D.; Yang, Zhi-Yong; Mascola, John R.; Nabel, Gary J.; Kwong, Peter D.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Carrico, Chris; Schief, William R.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Julien, Jean-Philippe; Khayat, Reza; Pejchal, Robert; Diwanji, Devan; Ward, Andrew B.; Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Julien, Jean-Philippe; Khayat, Reza; Pejchal, Robert; Diwanji, Devan; Ward, Andrew B.; Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Patel, Nikita; Arthos, James] NIAID, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shahzad-ul-Hussan, Syed; Bewley, Carole A.] NIDDKD, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bonsignori, Mattia; Haynes, Barton F.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Crump, John A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Int Hlth, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Crump, John A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Crump, John A.; Sam, Noel E.] Tumaini Univ, Kilimanjaro Christian Med Ctr, Moshi, Tanzania; [Crump, John A.; Sam, Noel E.] Tumaini Univ, Kilimanjaro Christian Med Coll, Moshi, Tanzania; [Kapiga, Saidi H.; Sam, Noel E.] Kilimanjaro Reprod Hlth Programme, Moshi, Tanzania; [Wyatt, Richard] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, TSRI, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02129 USA; [Koff, Wayne C.; Phogat, Sanjay] IAVI, New York, NY 10004 USA; [Orwenyo, Jared; Wang, Lai-Xi] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Inst Human Virol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Orwenyo, Jared; Wang, Lai-Xi] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Kwong, PD (reprint author), NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",pdkwong@nih.gov,"Schmidt, Stephen/B-5398-2012; Kwon, Young Do/A-6957-2010; Zhou, Tongqing/A-6880-2010; Louder, Robert/F-4713-2014; Ward, Andrew/F-9203-2014","Zhou, Tongqing/0000-0002-3935-4637; Louder, Robert/0000-0002-6944-9346; Ward, Andrew/0000-0001-7153-3769; Carrico, Chris/0000-0003-0939-9006; Gorman, Jason/0000-0002-3775-6560; Julien, Jean-Philippe/0000-0001-7602-3995","National Institutes of Health (NIH); International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; Ragon Institute; Canadian Institute of Health Research; NIH through the National Center for Research Resources [RR017573]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [W-31-109-Eng-38]","We thank A.

There is consensus that a white dwarf star explodes after accreting matter in a binary system, but the secondary body could be anything from a main-sequence star to a red giant, or even another white dwarf. This uncertainty stems from the fact that no recent type Ia supernova has been discovered close enough to Earth to detect the stars before explosion. Here we report early observations of supernova SN 2011fe in the galaxy M101 at a distance(7) from Earth of 6.4 megaparsecs. We find that the exploding star was probably a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and from the lack of an early shock we conclude that the companion was probably a main-sequence star. Early spectroscopy shows high-velocity oxygen that slows rapidly, on a timescale of hours, and extensive mixing of newly synthesized intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers of the supernova. A companion paper(8) uses pre-explosion images to rule out luminous red giants and most helium stars as companions to the progenitor.","[Nugent, Peter E.; Thomas, Rollin C.; Kasen, Daniel; Suzuki, Nao; Poznanski, Dovi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nugent, Peter E.; Cenko, S.

There are two classes of models(1,3): double-degenerate (involving two white dwarfs in a close binary system(2,4)) and single-degenerate models(5,6). In the latter, the primary white dwarf accretes material from a secondary companion until conditions are such that carbon ignites, at a mass of 1.38 times the mass of the Sun. The type Ia supernova SN 2011fe was recently detected in a nearby galaxy(7). Here we report an analysis of archival images of the location of SN 2011fe. The luminosity of the progenitor system (especially the companion star) is 10-100 times fainter than previous limits on other type Ia supernova progenitor systems(8-10), allowing us to rule out luminous red giants and almost all helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the exploding white dwarf.","[Li, Weidong; Bloom, Joshua S.; Miller, Adam A.; Cenko, S.

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, any detector or amplifier necessarily adds a certain amount of noise to the signal, equal to at least the noise added by quantum fluctuations(1,2). This quantum limit of added noise has nearly been reached in superconducting devices that take advantage of nonlinearities in Josephson junctions(3,4). Here we introduce the concept of the amplification of microwave signals using mechanical oscillation, which seems likely to enable quantum-limited operation. We drive a nanomechanical resonator with a radiation pressure force(5-7), and provide an experimental demonstration and an analytical description of how a signal input to a microwave cavity induces coherent stimulated emission and, consequently, signal amplification. This generic scheme, which is based on two linear oscillators, has the advantage of being conceptually and practically simpler than the Josephson junction devices. In our device, we achieve signal amplification of 25 decibels with the addition of 20 quanta of noise, which is consistent with the expected amount of added noise. The generality of the model allows for realization in other physical systems as well, and we anticipate that near-quantum-limited mechanical microwave amplification will soon be feasible in various applications involving integrated electrical circuits.","[Massel, F.; Heikkila, T.

P.",,,Jamming by shear,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GRANULAR-MATERIALS; STRESS; PACKINGS,"A broad class of disordered materials including foams, glassy molecular systems, colloids and granular materials can form jammed states. A jammed system can resist small stresses without deforming irreversibly, whereas unjammed systems flow under any applied stresses. The broad applicability of the Liu-Nagel jamming concept(1,2) has attracted intensive theoretical and modelling interest but has prompted less experimental effort(1-6). In the Liu-Nagel framework, jammed states of athermal systems exist only above a certain critical density. Although numerical simulations for particles that do not experience friction broadly support this idea(7-13), the nature of the jamming transition for frictional grains is less clear(14-17). Here we show that jamming of frictional, disk-shaped grains can be induced by the application of shear stress at densities lower than the critical value, at which isotropic (shear-free) jamming occurs. These jammed states have a much richer phenomenology than the isotropic jammed states: for small applied shear stresses, the states are fragile, with a strong force network that percolates only in one direction. A minimum shear stress is needed to create robust, shear-jammed states with a strong force network percolating in all directions. The transitions from unjammed to fragile states and from fragile to shear-jammed states are controlled by the fraction of force-bearing grains. The fractions at which these transitions occur are statistically independent of the density. Jammed states with densities lower than the critical value have an anisotropic fabric (contact network). The minimum anisotropy of shear-jammed states vanishes as the density approaches the critical value from below, in a manner reminiscent of an order-disorder transition.","[Zhang, Jie; Behringer, R.

The reduced connectivity between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean at the time of the salinity crisis is thought to have resulted from tectonic uplift of the Gibraltar arc seaway and global sea-level changes, both of which control the inflow of water required to compensate for the hydrological deficit of the Mediterranean(1,4). However, the different timescales on which tectonic uplift and changes in sea level occur are difficult to reconcile with the long duration of the shallow connection between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic(5) needed to explain the large amount of salt precipitated. Here we use numerical modelling to show that seaway erosion caused by the Atlantic inflow could sustain such a shallow connection between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean by counteracting tectonic uplift. The erosion and uplift rates required are consistent with previous mountain erosion studies, with the present altitude of marine sediments in the Gibraltar arc(6,7) and with geodynamic models suggesting a lithospheric slab tear underneath the region(8-10). The moderate Mediterranean sea-level drawdown during the early stages of the Messinian salinity crisis(3,5) can be explained by an uplift of a few millimetres per year counteracted by similar rates of erosion due to Atlantic inflow. Our findings suggest that the competition between uplift and erosion can result in harmonic coupling between erosion and the Mediterranean sea level, providing an alternative mechanism for the cyclicity observed in early salt precipitation deposits and calling into question previous ideas regarding the timing of the events that occurred during the Messinian salinity crisis(1).","[Garcia-Castellanos, D.; Villasenor, A.] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Tierra Jaume Almera, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Garcia-Castellanos, D (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Tierra Jaume Almera, Sole & Sabaris S-N, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",danielgc@ictja.csic.es,"Garcia-Castellanos, Daniel/B-1203-2008; Villasenor, Antonio/A-8037-2008","Garcia-Castellanos, Daniel/0000-0001-8454-8572; Villasenor, Antonio/0000-0001-8592-4832","Spanish government [CGL2009-09662, CGL2006-05493, CGL2008-03474-E/BTE, CSD2006-00041]","We thank P.

This diversity has made Mollusca one of the best-studied groups of animals, yet their evolutionary relationships remain poorly resolved(1). Open questions have important implications for the origin of Mollusca and for morphological evolution within the group. These questions include whether the shell-less, vermiform aplacophoran molluscs diverged before the origin of the shelled molluscs (Conchifera)(2-4) or lost their shells secondarily. Monoplacophorans were not included in molecular studies until recently(5,6), when it was proposed that they constitute a clade named Serialia together with Polyplacophora (chitons), reflecting the serial repetition of body organs in both groups(5). Attempts to understand the early evolution of molluscs become even more complex when considering the large diversity of Cambrian fossils. These can have multiple dorsal shell plates and sclerites(7-10) or can be shell-less but with a typical molluscan radula and serially repeated gills(11). To better resolve the relationships among molluscs, we generated transcriptome data for 15 species that, in combination with existing data, represent for the first time all major molluscan groups. We analysed multiple data sets containing up to 216,402 sites and 1,185 gene regions using multiple models and methods. Our results support the clade Aculifera, containing the three molluscan groups with spicules but without true shells, and they support the monophyly of Conchifera. Monoplacophora is not the sister group to other Conchifera but to Cephalopoda. Strong support is found for a clade that comprises Scaphopoda (tusk shells), Gastropoda and Bivalvia, with most analyses placing Scaphopoda and Gastropoda as sister groups. This well-resolved tree will constitute a framework for further studies of mollusc evolution, development and anatomy.","[Wilson, Nerida G.] Australian Museum, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Smith, Stephen A.; Goetz, Freya E.; Feehery, Caitlin; Dunn, Casey W.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Smith, Stephen A.] Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies, D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wilson, Nerida G.; Feehery, Caitlin; Rouse, Greg W.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Andrade, Sonia C.

Despite recent advances in the use of molecular tools to study permafrost microbial communities(6-9), their response to thaw remains unclear. Here we use deep metagenomic sequencing to determine the impact of thaw on microbial phylogenetic and functional genes, and relate these data to measurements of methane emissions. Metagenomics, the direct sequencing of DNA from the environment, allows the examination of whole biochemical pathways and associated processes, as opposed to individual pieces of the metabolic puzzle. Our metagenome analyses reveal that during transition from a frozen to a thawed state there are rapid shifts in many microbial, phylogenetic and functional gene abundances and pathways. After one week of incubation at 5 degrees C, permafrost metagenomes converge to be more similar to each other than while they are frozen. We find that multiple genes involved in cycling of C and nitrogen shift rapidly during thaw. We also construct the first draft genome from a complex soil metagenome, which corresponds to a novel methanogen. Methane previously accumulated in permafrost is released during thaw and subsequently consumed by methanotrophic bacteria. Together these data point towards the importance of rapid cycling of methane and nitrogen in thawing permafrost.","[Mackelprang, Rachel; Rubin, Edward M.; Jansson, Janet K.] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Mackelprang, Rachel] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Waldrop, Mark P.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [DeAngelis, Kristen M.; David, Maude M.; Chavarria, Krystle L.; Jansson, Janet K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Blazewicz, Steven J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rubin, Edward M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Jansson, JK (reprint author), US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA.",jrjansson@lbl.gov,,"Waldrop, Mark/0000-0003-1829-7140; DeAngelis, Kristen/0000-0002-5585-4551",Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Venture Capital; United States Geological Survey,"The work conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Earth Sciences Division (Laboratory Directed Research Development) and the Joint Genome Institute was supported in part by the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy under Contract no.

Thus, a sustained capacity for axon regeneration is critical for achieving functional restoration. Although deletion of either phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), or suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) individually promoted significant optic nerve regeneration, such regrowth tapered off around 2 weeks after the crush injury(1,2). Here we show that, remarkably, simultaneous deletion of both PTEN and SOCS3 enables robust and sustained axon regeneration. We further show that PTEN and SOCS3 regulate two independent pathways that act synergistically to promote enhanced axon regeneration. Gene expression analyses suggest that double deletion not only results in the induction of many growth-related genes, but also allows RGCs to maintain the expression of a repertoire of genes at the physiological level after injury. Our results reveal concurrent activation of mTOR and STAT3 pathways as key for sustaining long-distance axon regeneration in adult CNS, a crucial step towards functional recovery.","[Sun, Fang; Belin, Stephane; Chen, Gang; Yeung, Cecil; He, Zhigang] Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sun, Fang; Belin, Stephane; Chen, Gang; Yeung, Cecil; He, Zhigang] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Kevin K.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Miami Project Cure Paralysis, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Wang, Dongqing; Feng, Guoping] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lu, Tao; Yankner, Bruce A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Shiley Eye Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","He, ZG (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr, Sch Med, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Zhigang.he@childrens.harvard.edu,,"Belin, Stephane/0000-0001-7074-6885",Wings for Life; Miami Project to Cure Paralysis; NEI,"We thank M.

The disease's name derives from a visually apparent white growth of the newly discovered fungus Geomyces destructans on the skin (including the muzzle) of hibernating bats(1,3). Colonization of skin by this fungus is associated with characteristic cutaneous lesions that are the only consistent pathological finding related to WNS4. However, the role of G. destructans in WNS remains controversial because evidence to implicate the fungus as the primary cause of this disease is lacking. The debate is fuelled, in part, by the assumption that fungal infections in mammals are most commonly associated with immune system dysfunction(5-7). Additionally, the recent discovery that G. destructans commonly colonizes the skin of bats of Europe, where no unusual bat mortality events have been reported(8-10), has generated further speculation that the fungus is an opportunistic pathogen and that other unidentified factors are the primary cause of WNS11,12. Here we demonstrate that exposure of healthy little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to pure cultures of G. destructans causes WNS. Live G. destructans was subsequently cultured from diseased bats, successfully fulfilling established criteria for the determination of G. destructans as a primary pathogen(13). We also confirmed that WNS can be transmitted from infected bats to healthy bats through direct contact. Our results provide the first direct evidence that G. destructans is the causal agent of WNS and that the recent emergence of WNS in North America may represent translocation of the fungus to a region with a naive population of animals(8). Demonstration of causality is an instrumental step in elucidating the pathogenesis(14) and epidemiology(15) of WNS and in guiding management actions to preserve bat populations against the novel threat posed by this devastating infectious disease.","[Lorch, Jeffrey M.; Meteyer, Carol U.; Ballmann, Anne E.; Blehert, David S.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Lorch, Jeffrey M.] Univ Wisconsin, Mol & Environm Toxicol Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Behr, Melissa J.] Wisconsin Vet Diagnost Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Boyles, Justin G.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Cryan, Paul M.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Hicks, Alan C.] New York Dept Environm Conservat, Albany, NY 12233 USA; [Coleman, Jeremy T.

SAMHD1 is also associated with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), an inflammatory encephalopathy characterized by chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis and elevated levels of the antiviral cytokine IFN-alpha(8). The pathology associated with AGS resembles congenital viral infection, such as transplacentally acquired HIV. Here we show that human SAMHD1 is a potent dGTP-stimulated triphosphohydrolase that converts deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the constituent deoxynucleoside and inorganic triphosphate. The crystal structure of the catalytic core of SAMHD1 reveals that the protein is dimeric and indicates a molecular basis for dGTP stimulation of catalytic activity against dNTPs. We propose that SAMHD1, which is highly expressed in dendritic cells, restricts HIV-1 replication by hydrolysing the majority of cellular dNTPs, thus inhibiting reverse transcription and viral complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis.","[Goldstone, David C.; Ennis-Adeniran, Valerie; Hedden, Joseph J.; Christodoulou, Evangelos; Walker, Philip A.; Haire, Lesley F.; Taylor, Ian A.] MRC Natl Inst Med Res, Div Mol Struct, London NW7 1AA, England; [Groom, Harriet C.

Although it is clear how nucleotide substitutions in cis-regulatory elements affect gene expression, it is not clear how amino-acid substitutions in transcription factors influence gene regulation(4-10). Here we show that amino-acid changes in the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (CEBPB, also known as C/EBP-beta) in the stem-lineage of placental mammals changed the way it responds to cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signalling. By functionally analysing resurrected ancestral proteins, we identify three amino-acid substitutions in an internal regulatory domain of CEBPB that are responsible for the novel function. These amino-acid substitutions reorganize the location of key phosphorylation sites, introducing a new site and removing two ancestral sites, reversing the response of CEBPB to GSK-3 beta-mediated phosphorylation from repression to activation. We conclude that changing the response of transcription factors to signalling pathways can be an important mechanism of gene regulatory evolution.","[Lynch, Vincent J.; May, Gemma; Wagner, Guenter P.] Yale Univ, Yale Syst Biol Inst, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Lynch, Vincent J.; May, Gemma; Wagner, Guenter P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Lynch, VJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Yale Syst Biol Inst, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",vincent.j.lynch@yale.edu,,"Lynch, Vincent/0000-0001-5311-3824; Wagner, Gunter/0000-0002-3097-002X",John Templeton Foundation [12793]; Origin of Organismal Complexity,"This work was funded by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation, number 12793 Genetics and the Origin of Organismal Complexity; results presented here do not necessarily reflect the views of the John Templeton Foundation.

ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors activate ERK signalling(4-7) by transactivating RAF dimers(4). In melanomas with mutant BRAF(V600E), levels of RAS activation are low and these drugs bind to BRAF(V600E) monomers and inhibit their activity. This tumour-specific inhibition of ERK signalling results in a broad therapeutic index and RAF inhibitors have remarkable clinical activity in patients with melanomas that harbour mutant BRAF(V600E)(8). However, resistance invariably develops. Here, we identify a new resistance mechanism. We find that a subset of cells resistant to vemurafenib (PLX4032, RG7204) express a 61-kDa variant form of BRAF(V600E), p61BRAF(V600E), which lacks exons 4-8, a region that encompasses the RAS-binding domain. p61BRAF(V600E) shows enhanced dimerization in cells with low levels of RAS activation, as compared to full-length BRAF(V600E). In cells in which p61BRAF(V600E) is expressed endogenously or ectopically, ERK signalling is resistant to the RAF inhibitor. Moreover, a mutation that abolishes the dimerization of p61BRAF(V600E) restores its sensitivity to vemurafenib. Finally, we identified BRAF(V600E) splicing variants lacking the RAS-binding domain in the tumours of six of nineteen patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. These data support the model that inhibition of ERK signalling by RAF inhibitors is dependent on levels of RAS-GTP too low to support RAF dimerization and identify a novel mechanism of acquired resistance in patients: expression of splicing isoforms of BRAF(V600E) that dimerize in a RAS-independent manner.","[Persaud, Yogindra; Janakiraman, Manickam; Solit, David B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Poulikakos, Poulikos I.; Gabay, May Tal; Tadi, Madhavi; Rosen, Neal] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kong, Xiangju; Moriceau, Gatien; Shi, Hubing; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Dermatol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ng, Charles; Atefi, Mohammad; Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Hematol & Oncol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Titz, Bjoern; Graeber, Thomas G.; Ribas, Antoni; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Salton, Maayan; Misteli, Tom] NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Dahlman, Kimberly B.; Sosman, Jeffrey A.] Vanderbilt Ingram Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Wargo, Jennifer A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Flaherty, Keith T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kelley, Mark C.] Vanderbilt Ingram Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Chapman, Paul B.; Rosen, Neal; Solit, David B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA","Solit, DB (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",solitd@mskcc.org,"Titz, Bjorn/B-9516-2008; Shi, Hubing/B-8445-2014; Titz, Bjoern/G-6317-2017","Titz, Bjoern/0000-0003-4414-4105; Shi, Hubing/0000-0002-2926-3440; Janakiraman, Manickam/0000-0003-4423-6237; Graeber, Thomas/0000-0001-8574-9181","Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center; T.

RNAi components have been reported to have a role in the nucleus, as they are involved in epigenetic regulation and heterochromatin formation(7-10). However, although RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing is well documented, the mechanisms of RNAi-mediated transcriptional gene silencing and, in particular, the role of RNAi components in chromatin dynamics, especially in animal multicellular organisms, are elusive. Here we show that the key RNAi components Dicer 2 (DCR2) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) associate with chromatin (with a strong preference for euchromatic, transcriptionally active, loci) and interact with the core transcription machinery. Notably, loss of function of DCR2 or AGO2 showed that transcriptional defects are accompanied by the perturbation of RNA polymerase II positioning on promoters. Furthermore, after heat shock, both Dcr2 and Ago2 null mutations, as well as missense mutations that compromise the RNAi activity, impaired the global dynamics of RNA polymerase II. Finally, the deep sequencing of the AGO2-associated small RNAs (AGO2 RIP-seq) revealed that AGO2 is strongly enriched in small RNAs that encompass the promoter regions and other regions of heat-shock and other genetic loci on both the sense and antisense DNA strands, but with a strong bias for the antisense strand, particularly after heat shock. Taken together, our results show that DCR2 and AGO2 are globally associated with transcriptionally active loci and may have a pivotal role in shaping the transcriptome by controlling the processivity of RNA polymerase II.","[Cernilogar, Filippo M.; Parsi, Krishna Mohan; Lo Sardo, Federica; Orlando, Valerio] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, Epigenet & Genome Reprogramming, I-00143 Rome, Italy; [Cernilogar, Filippo M.; Parsi, Krishna Mohan] IGB ABT CNR, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Onorati, Maria Cristina; Corona, Davide F.

Whereas PLs function predominantly in DNA repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photolesions caused by ultraviolet radiation, CRYs transduce signals important for growth, development, magnetosensitivity and circadian clocks(1-5). Despite these diverse functions, PLs/CRYs preserve a common structural fold, a dependence on flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and an internal photoactivation mechanism(3,6). However, members of the CRY/PL family differ in the substrates recognized (protein or DNA), photochemical reactions catalysed and involvement of an antenna cofactor. It is largely unknown how the animal CRYs that regulate circadian rhythms act on their substrates. CRYs contain a variable carboxy-terminal tail that appends the conserved PL homology domain (PHD) and is important for function(7-12). Here, we report a 2.3-angstrom resolution crystal structure of Drosophila CRY with an intact C terminus. The C-terminal helix docks in the analogous groove that binds DNA substrates in PLs. Conserved Trp 536 juts into the CRY catalytic centre to mimic PL recognition of DNA photolesions. The FAD anionic semiquinone found in the crystals assumes a conformation to facilitate restructuring of the tail helix. These results help reconcile the diverse functions of the CRY/PL family by demonstrating how conserved protein architecture and photochemistry can be elaborated into a range of light-driven functions.","[Zoltowski, Brian D.; Vaidya, Anand T.; Widom, Joanne; Crane, Brian R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Top, Deniz; Young, Michael W.] Rockefeller Univ, Genet Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA","Crane, BR (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bc69@cornell.edu,,"Vaidya, Anand/0000-0002-5812-5266","NIH [GM079679, GM054339]","This study was supported by NIH Grant GM079679 to B.

Their count and volume are tightly controlled within narrow physiological ranges, but there is only limited understanding of the molecular processes controlling both traits. Here we carried out a high-powered meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in up to 66,867 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment. We identified 68 genomic loci reliably associated with platelet count and volume mapping to established and putative novel regulators of megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation. These genes show megakaryocyte-specific gene expression patterns and extensive network connectivity. Using gene silencing in Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster, we identified 11 of the genes as novel regulators of blood cell formation. Taken together, our findings advance understanding of novel gene functions controlling fate-determining events during megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation, providing a new example of successful translation of GWAS to function.","[Gieger, Christian; Kuehnel, Brigitte] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Genet Epidemiol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Radhakrishnan, Aparna; Cvejic, Ana; Serbanovic-Canic, Jovana; Meacham, Stuart; Voss, Katrin; Stephens, Jonathan; Attwood, Antony; Jolley, Jennifer; Lloyd-Jones, Heather; Sambrook, Jennifer; Rendon, Augusto; Ouwehand, Willem H.] Univ Cambridge & NHS Blood & Transplant, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 0PT, England; [Radhakrishnan, Aparna; Cvejic, Ana; Serbanovic-Canic, Jovana; Meacham, Stuart; Ramirez-Solis, Ramiro; Shin, So-Youn; Kanoni, Stavroula; Attwood, Antony; Memari, Yasin; Yang, Tsun-Po; Deloukas, Panos; Stemple, Derek; Ouwehand, Willem H.; Soranzo, Nicole] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; [Radhakrishnan, Aparna; Cvejic, Ana; Serbanovic-Canic, Jovana; Meacham, Stuart; Ramirez-Solis, Ramiro; Shin, So-Youn; Kanoni, Stavroula; Attwood, Antony; Memari, Yasin; Yang, Tsun-Po; Deloukas, Panos; Stemple, Derek; Ouwehand, Willem H.; Soranzo, Nicole] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Tang, Weihong; Folsom, Aaron R.] Univ Minnesota, Div Epidemiol & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Porcu, Eleonora; Cucca, Francesco; Uda, Manuela; Sanna, Serena] Cittadella Univ Monserrato, CNR, Ist Ric Genet & Biomed, I-09042 Cagliari, Italy; [Pistis, Giorgio; Sala, Cinzia; Toniolo, Daniela] Ist Sci San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Elling, Ulrich; Penninger, Josef] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Goodall, Alison H.; Samani, Nilesh J.] Univ Leicester, Glenfield Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Sci, Leicester LE3 9QP, Leics, England; [Goodall, Alison H.; Samani, Nilesh J.] Glenfield Hosp, Leicester NIHR Biomed Res Unit Cardiovasc Dis, Leicester LE3 9QP, Leics, England; [Labrune, Yann; Bonnefond, Amelie; Froguel, Philippe] Inst Biol Lille, CNRS, UMR 8199, F-59019 Lille, France; [Lopez, Lorna M.; Porteous, David J.; Starr, John M.; Visscher, Peter M.; Deary, Ian J.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Cognit Ageing & Cognit Epidemiol, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lopez, Lorna M.; Davies, Gail; Deary, Ian J.] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Psychol, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Maegi, Reedik] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Okada, Yukinori; Takahashi, Atsushi; Kamatani, Naoyuki] RIKEN Ctr Genom Med, Inst Phys & Chem Res, Lab Stat Anal, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Okada, Yukinori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Allergy & Rheumatol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; [Pirastu, Nicola; D'Adamo, Pio; Ulivi, Sheila; Gasparini, Paolo] IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, I-34137 Trieste, Italy; [Sorice, Rossella; Ruggiero, Daniela; Ciullo, Marina] CNR, Inst Genet & Biophys A Buzzati Traverso, I-8031 Naples, Italy; [Teumer, Alexander; Voelker, Uwe] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Interfac Inst Genet & Funct Genom, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Zhang, Weihua; Chambers, John C.; Elliott, Paul] Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London W2 1PG, England; [Bis, Joshua C.; Wiggins, Kerri L.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ellinghaus, David; Schreiber, Stefan; Franke, Andre] Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Goegele, Martin; Pramstaller, Peter P.; Hicks, Andrew A.] European Acad Bozen Bolzano, Ctr Biomed, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Hottenga, Jouke-Jan; de Geus, Eco J.

However, only a subset of stem cells becomes active during each round of morphogenesis, indicating that stem cells coexist in heterogeneous responsive states. Using a circadian-clock reporter-mouse model, here we show that the dormant hair-follicle stem cell niche contains coexisting populations of cells at opposite phases of the clock, which are differentially predisposed to respond to homeostatic cues. The core clock protein Bmal1 modulates the expression of stem cell regulatory genes in an oscillatory manner, to create populations that are either predisposed, or less prone, to activation. Disrupting this clock equilibrium, through deletion of Bmal1 (also known as Arntl) or Per1/2, resulted in a progressive accumulation or depletion of dormant stem cells, respectively. Stem cell arrhythmia also led to premature epidermal ageing, and a reduction in the development of squamous tumours. Our results indicate that the circadian clock fine-tunes the temporal behaviour of epidermal stem cells, and that its perturbation affects homeostasis and the predisposition to tumorigenesis.","[Janich, Peggy; Pascual, Gloria; Di Croce, Luciano; Aznar Benitah, Salvador] Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Janich, Peggy; Pascual, Gloria; Di Croce, Luciano; Aznar Benitah, Salvador] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Merlos-Suarez, Anna; Batlle, Eduard] Inst Res Biomed, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Batlle, Eduard; Di Croce, Luciano; Aznar Benitah, Salvador] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Ripperger, Juergen; Albrecht, Urs] Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Cheng, Hai-Ying M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Obrietan, Karl] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Benitah, SA (reprint author), Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",salvador.aznar-benitah@crg.es,"Albrecht, Urs/A-9831-2011; Di Croce, Luciano/E-7759-2015; Aznar-Benitah, Salvador/F-4761-2016; Batlle, Eduard/K-8080-2014","Di Croce, Luciano/0000-0003-3488-6228; Aznar-Benitah, Salvador/0000-0002-9059-5049; Batlle, Eduard/0000-0003-2422-0326; Albrecht, Urs/0000-0002-0663-8676",AICR (Association for International Cancer Research); Spanish Ministry of Health (FIS); AGAUR (Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca; Government of Cataluna); AGAUR; FIS; ICREA,"We thank the AICR (Association for International Cancer Research), the Spanish Ministry of Health (FIS) and AGAUR (Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca; Government of Cataluna) for financial support.

Although the luminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early Universe suggest that some were powered by black holes with masses greater than 10 billion solar masses(1,2), the remnants of these objects have not been found in the nearby Universe. The giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 hosts the hitherto most massive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses(3,4). Here we report that NGC 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance from Earth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billion solar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present in NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in the Coma cluster (at a distance of 103 megaparsecs). These two black holes are significantly more massive than predicted by linearly extrapolating the widely used correlations between black-hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the host galaxy(5-9). Although these correlations remain useful for predicting black-hole masses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest that different evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxies and their black holes.","[McConnell, Nicholas J.; Ma, Chung-Pei; Wright, Shelley A.; Graham, James R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gebhardt, Karl; Murphy, Jeremy D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Astron, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Lauer, Tod R.] Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85726 USA; [Graham, James R.] Univ Toronto, Dunlap Inst Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H4, Canada; [Richstone, Douglas O.] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","McConnell, NJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",nmcc@berkeley.edu; cpma@berkeley.edu,,"Wright, Shelley/0000-0003-1034-8054","National Science Foundation; NASA; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley; G. and C.

The non-classical correlations (entanglement) between the two subsystems imply that the observables of one subsystem are determined by the measurement choice on the other, regardless of the distance between the subsystems. Nowadays, continuous-variable entanglement is regarded as an essential resource, allowing for quantum enhanced measurement resolution(2), the realization of quantum teleportation(3-5) and quantum memories(3,6), or the demonstration of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox(1,7-9). These applications rely on techniques to manipulate and detect coherences of quantum fields, the quadratures. Whereas in optics coherent homodyne detection(10) of quadratures is a standard technique, for massive particles a corresponding method was missing. Here we report the realization of an atomic analogue to homodyne detection for the measurement of matter-wave quadratures. The application of this technique to a quantum state produced by spin-changing collisions in a Bose-Einstein condensate(11,12) reveals continuous-variable entanglement, as well as the twin-atom character of the state(13). Our results provide a rare example of continuous-variable entanglement of massive particles(6,14). The direct detection of atomic quadratures has applications not only in experimental quantum atom optics, but also for the measurement of fields in many-body systems of massive particles(15).","[Gross, C.; Strobel, H.; Nicklas, E.; Zibold, T.; Oberthaler, M.

One such challenge arises from the enzymatic metabolism of drugs in vivo by cytochrome P450 oxidases, which use single-electron oxidative mechanisms to rapidly modify small molecules to facilitate their excretion(2). A commonly used synthetic strategy to protect against in vivo metabolism involves the incorporation of electron-withdrawing functionality, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF(3)) group, into drug candidates(3). The CF(3) group enjoys a privileged role in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into small molecules often enhances efficacy by promoting electrostatic interactions with targets, improving cellular membrane permeability, and increasing robustness towards oxidative metabolism of the drug(4-6). Although common pharmacophores often bear CF(3) motifs in an aromatic system, access to such analogues typically requires the incorporation of the CF(3) group, or a surrogate moiety, at the start of a multi-step synthetic sequence. Here we report a mild, operationally simple strategy for the direct trifluoromethylation of unactivated arenes and heteroarenes through a radical-mediated mechanism using commercial photocatalysts and a household light bulb. We demonstrate the broad utility of this transformation through addition of CF(3) to a number of heteroaromatic and aromatic systems. The benefit to medicinal chemistry and applicability to late-stage drug development is also shown through examples of the direct trifluoromethylation of widely prescribed pharmaceutical agents.","[Nagib, David A.; MacMillan, David W.

This general concept has been elaborated into hypotheses that precession(2), obliquity(3,4) or combinations of both(5-8) could pace deglaciations during the late Pleistocene(9,10). Earlier tests have shown that obliquity paces the late Pleistocene glacial cycles(4,11) but have been inconclusive with regard to precession, whose shorter period of about 20,000 years makes phasing more sensitive to timing errors(4,11,12). No quantitative test has provided firm evidence for a dual effect. Here I show that both obliquity and precession pace late Pleistocene glacial cycles. Deficiencies in time control that have long stymied efforts to establish orbital effects on deglaciation are overcome using a new statistical test that focuses on maxima in orbital forcing. The results are fully consistent with Milankovitch's proposal but also admit the possibility that long Southern Hemisphere summers contribute to deglaciation.","Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Huybers, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",phuybers@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,30,42,45,1,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Dec,2011,480,7376,,,,,229,232,,10.1038/nature10626,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,857TR,WOS:000297744200048,22158246,No,,,11/20/17

Over the past few decades, laboratory studies of rock friction have elucidated many aspects of tectonic fault zone processes and earthquake phenomena(3-5). Typically, the static friction of rocks grows logarithmically with time when they are held in stationary contact(6), but the mechanism responsible for this strengthening is not understood. This time-dependent increase of frictional strength, or frictional ageing, is one manifestation of the 'evolution effect' in rate and state friction theory(5). A prevailing view is that the time dependence of rock friction results from increases in contact area caused by creep of contacting asperities(7,8). Here we present the results of atomic force microscopy experiments that instead show that frictional ageing arises from the formation of interfacial chemical bonds, and the large magnitude of ageing at the nanometre scale is quantitatively consistent with what is required to explain observations in macroscopic rock friction experiments. The relative magnitude of the evolution effect compared with that of the 'direct effect'-the dependence of friction on instantaneous changes in slip velocity-determine whether unstable slip, leading to earthquakes, is possible(9,10). Understanding the mechanism underlying the evolution effect would enable us to formulate physically based frictional constitutive laws, rather than the current empirically based 'laws'(11,12), allowing more confident extrapolation to natural faults.","[Li, Qunyang; Carpick, Robert W.] Univ Penn, Dept Mech Engn & Appl Mech, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tullis, Terry E.; Goldsby, David] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Carpick, RW (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Mech Engn & Appl Mech, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",carpick@seas.upenn.edu,"Li, Qunyang/A-2368-2011","Li, Qunyang/0000-0002-6865-3863","National Science Foundation [EAR0810088, EAR0810192]","We thank M.O.

The structure and development of ommatidia in arthropod compound eyes support a single origin some time before the latest common ancestor of crown-group arthropods(4), but the appearance of compound eyes in the arthropod stem group has been poorly constrained in the absence of adequate fossils. Here we report 2-3-cm paired eyes from the early Cambrian (approximately 515 million years old) Emu Bay Shale of South Australia, assigned to the Cambrian apex predator Anomalocaris. Their preserved visual surfaces are composed of at least 16,000 hexagonally packed ommatidial lenses (in a single eye), rivalling the most acute compound eyes in modern arthropods. The specimens show two distinct taphonomic modes, preserved as iron oxide (after pyrite) and calcium phosphate, demonstrating that disparate styles of early diagenetic mineralization can replicate the same type of extracellular tissue (that is, cuticle) within a single Burgess-Shale-type deposit. These fossils also provide compelling evidence for the arthropod affinities of anomalocaridids, push the origin of compound eyes deeper down the arthropod stem lineage, and indicate that the compound eye evolved before such features as a hardened exoskeleton. The inferred acuity of the anomalocaridid eye is consistent with other evidence that these animals were highly mobile visual predators in the water column(5,6). The existence of large, macrophagous nektonic predators possessing sharp vision-such as Anomalocaris-within the early Cambrian ecosystem probably helped to accelerate the escalatory 'arms race' that began over half a billion years ago(7,8).","[Paterson, John R.] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Div Earth Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Garcia-Bellido, Diego C.] Inst Geociencias CSIC UCM, Dept Geol Sedimentaria & Cambio Ambiental, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Lee, Michael S.

In particular, HGT provides rapid access to genetic innovations, allowing traits such as virulence(3), antibiotic resistance(4) and xenobiotic metabolism(5) to spread through the human microbiome. Recent anecdotal studies providing snapshots of active gene flow on the human body have highlighted the need to determine the frequency of such recent transfers and the forces that govern these events(4,5). Here we report the discovery and characterization of a vast, human-associated network of gene exchange, large enough to directly compare the principal forces shaping HGT. We show that this network of 10,770 unique, recently transferred (more than 99% nucleotide identity) genes found in 2,235 full bacterial genomes, is shaped principally by ecology rather than geography or phylogeny, with most gene exchange occurring between isolates from ecologically similar, but geographically separated, environments. For example, we observe 25-fold more HGT between human-associated bacteria than among ecologically diverse non-human isolates (P = 3.0 x 10(-270)). We show that within the human microbiome this ecological architecture continues across multiple spatial scales, functional classes and ecological niches with transfer further enriched among bacteria that inhabit the same body site, have the same oxygen tolerance or have the same ability to cause disease. This structure offers a window into the molecular traits that define ecological niches, insight that we use to uncover sources of antibiotic resistance and identify genes associated with the pathology of meningitis and other diseases.","[Cordero, Otto X.; Alm, Eric J.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Smillie, Chris S.; Friedman, Jonathan] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Smith, Mark B.] MIT, Microbiol Grad Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [David, Lawrence A.] Harvard Univ, Soc Fellows, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Alm, Eric J.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Alm, Eric J.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Alm, EJ (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ejalm@mit.edu,"David, Lawrence/B-1044-2010","David, Lawrence/0000-0002-3570-4767","National Science Foundation [0918333, 0936234]; Department of Energy's ENIGMA Scientific Focus Area","This work was supported by National Science Foundation awards 0918333 and 0936234 to E.J.A., and by the Department of Energy's ENIGMA Scientific Focus Area.

Moreover, wild strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana differ in many epialleles(3,4), and these can influence the expression of nearby genes(1,2). However, to understand their role in evolution(5), it is imperative to ascertain the emergence rate and stability of epialleles, including those that are not due to structural variation. We have compared genome-wide DNA methylation among 10 A. thaliana lines, derived 30 generations ago from a common ancestor(6). Epimutations at individual positions were easily detected, and close to 30,000 cytosines in each strain were differentially methylated. In contrast, larger regions of contiguous methylation were much more stable, and the frequency of changes was in the same low range as that of DNA mutations(7). Like individual positions, the same regions were often affected by differential methylation in independent lines, with evidence for recurrent cycles of forward and reverse mutations. Transposable elements and short interfering RNAs have been causally linked to DNA methylation(8). In agreement, differentially methylated sites were farther from transposable elements and showed less association with short interfering RNA expression than invariant positions. The biased distribution and frequent reversion of epimutations have important implications for the potential contribution of sequence-independent epialleles to plant evolution.","[Becker, Claude; Hagmann, Joerg; Mueller, Jonas; Koenig, Daniel; Weigel, Detlef] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Stegle, Oliver; Borgwardt, Karsten] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Machine Learning & Computat Biol Res Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Stegle, Oliver; Borgwardt, Karsten] Max Planck Inst Intelligent Syst, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Weigel, D (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",weigel@weigelworld.org,"Weigel, Detlef/C-1418-2008","Weigel, Detlef/0000-0002-2114-7963; Stegle, Oliver/0000-0002-8818-7193; Koenig, Daniel/0000-0002-1037-5346; Becker, Claude/0000-0003-3406-4670",HFSP; Volkswagen Foundation; AENEAS [KBBE-2009-226477]; DFG; Max Planck Society,"We are grateful to R.

The reasons for this are usually unknown, but may include additional genetic variation and environmental risk factors(1). However, phenotypic discordance remains even in the absence of genetic variation, for example between monozygotic twins(2), and incomplete penetrance of mutations is frequent in isogenic model organisms in homogeneous environments(3,4). Here we propose a model for incomplete penetrance based on genetic interaction networks(5,6). Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we identify two compensation mechanisms that vary among individuals and influence mutation outcome. First, feedback induction of an ancestral gene duplicate differs across individuals, with high expression masking the effects of a mutation. This supports the hypothesis that redundancy is maintained in genomes to buffer stochastic developmental failure(7). Second, during normal embryonic development we find that there is substantial variation in the induction of molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 (DAF-21). Chaperones act as promiscuous buffers of genetic variation(8,9), and embryos with stronger induction of Hsp90 are less likely to be affected by an inherited mutation. Simultaneously quantifying the variation in these two independent responses allows the phenotypic outcome of a mutation to be more accurately predicted in individuals. Our model and methodology provide a framework for dissecting the causes of incomplete penetrance. Further, the results establish that inter-individual variation in both specific and more general buffering systems combine to determine the outcome inherited mutations in each individual.","[Burga, Alejandro; Olivia Casanueva, M.; Lehner, Ben] Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Burga, Alejandro; Olivia Casanueva, M.; Lehner, Ben] Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Lehner, Ben] Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Lehner, B (reprint author), Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",ben.lehner@crg.eu,"Lehner, Ben/L-3413-2014","Lehner, Ben/0000-0002-8817-1124",European Research Council; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion Plan Nacional [BFU2008-00365]; Agencia de Gestio d'juts Universitaris i de Recerca; ERASysBio+; European Molecular Biology Organization; EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; Formacion de Personal Investigador-Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion fellowship; Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship; National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources; ICREA,"This work was funded by grants from the European Research Council, Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion Plan Nacional BFU2008-00365, Agencia de Gestio d'juts Universitaris i de Recerca, ERASysBio+, the European Molecular Biology Organization Young Investigator Programme, the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program, by a Formacion de Personal Investigador-Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion fellowship to A.

Large-scale proteome analysis(1) has routinely involved digesting intact proteins followed by inferred protein identification using mass spectrometry(2). This 'bottom-up' process affords a high number of identifications (not always unique to a single gene). However, complications arise from incomplete or ambiguous(2) characterization of alternative splice forms, diverse modifications (for example, acetylation and methylation) and endogenous protein cleavages, especially when combinations of these create complex patterns of intact protein isoforms and species(3). 'Top-down' interrogation of whole proteins can overcome these problems for individual proteins(4,5), but has not been achieved on a proteome scale owing to the lack of intact protein fractionation methods that are well integrated with tandem mass spectrometry. Here we show, using a new four-dimensional separation system, identification of 1,043 gene products from human cells that are dispersed into more than 3,000 protein species created by post-translational modification (PTM), RNA splicing and proteolysis. The overall system produced greater than 20-fold increases in both separation power and proteome coverage, enabling the identification of proteins up to 105 kDa and those with up to 11 transmembrane helices. Many previously undetected isoforms of endogenous human proteins were mapped, including changes in multiply modified species in response to accelerated cellular ageing (senescence) induced by DNA damage. Integrated with the latest version of the Swiss-Prot database(6), the data provide precise correlations to individual genes and proof-of-concept for large-scale interrogation of whole protein molecules. The technology promises to improve the link between proteomics data and complex phenotypes in basic biology and disease research(7).","[Tran, John C.; Zamdborg, Leonid; Ahlf, Dorothy R.; Lee, Ji Eun; Catherman, Adam D.; Durbin, Kenneth R.; Vellaichamy, Adaikkalam; Kellie, John F.; Li, Mingxi; Wu, Cong; Sweet, Steve M.

The murine Piwi proteins Mili and Miwi2 (also called Piwil2 and Piwil4, respectively) direct epigenetic LINE1 and intracisternal A particle transposon silencing during genome reprogramming in the embryonic male germ line(2-4). Piwi proteins are proposed to be piRNA-guided endonucleases that initiate secondary piRNA biogenesis(5-7); however, the actual contribution of their endonuclease activities to piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing remain unknown. To investigate the role of Piwi-catalysed endonucleolytic activity, we engineered point mutations in mice that substitute the second aspartic acid to an alanine in the DDH catalytic triad of Mili and Miwi2, generating the Mili(DAH) and Miwi2(DAH) alleles, respectively. Analysis of Mili-bound piRNAs from homozygous Mili(DAH) fetal gonadocytes revealed a failure of transposon piRNA amplification, resulting in the marked reduction of piRNA bound within Miwi2 ribonuclear particles. We find that Mili-mediated piRNA amplification is selectively required for LINE1, but not intracisternal A particle, silencing. The defective piRNA pathway in Mili(DAH) mice results in spermatogenic failure and sterility. Surprisingly, homozygous Miwi2(DAH) mice are fertile, transposon silencing is established normally and no defects in secondary piRNA biogenesis are observed.

This silencing depends on the participation of the Piwi proteins in a slicer-dependent piRNA amplification pathway and is essential for male fertility(3,4). A third Piwi family member, Miwi (also known as Piwil1), is expressed in specific postnatal germ cells and associates with a unique set of piRNAs of unknown function(5-7). Here we show that Miwi is a small RNA-guided RNase (slicer) that requires extensive complementarity for target cleavage in vitro. Disruption of its catalytic activity in mice by a single point mutation causes male infertility, and mutant germ cells show increased accumulation of LINE1 retrotransposon transcripts. We provide evidence for Miwi slicer activity directly cleaving transposon messenger RNAs, offering an explanation for the continued maintenance of repeat-derived piRNAs long after transposon silencing is established in germline stem cells. Furthermore, our study supports a slicer-dependent silencing mechanism that functions without piRNA amplification. Thus, Piwi proteins seem to act in a two-pronged mammalian transposon silencing strategy: one promotes transcriptional repression in the embryo, the other reinforces silencing at the post-transcriptional level after birth.","[Reuter, Michael; Berninger, Philipp; Pillai, Ramesh S.] European Mol Biol Lab, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Reuter, Michael; Berninger, Philipp; Pillai, Ramesh S.] CNRS, UJF, EMBL Int Unit, UMI Virus Host Cell Interact UVHCI 3265, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Chuma, Shinichiro; Hosokawa, Mihoko] Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Chuma, Shinichiro; Hosokawa, Mihoko] Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci iCeMS, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Shah, Hardik; Sachidanandam, Ravi] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Antony, Claude] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Pillai, RS (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, 6 Rue Jules Horowitz,BP 181, F-38042 Grenoble, France.",pillai@embl.fr,,"sachidanandam, ravi/0000-0001-9844-4459","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); Agence National de la Recherche (ANR) (piRmachines); European Union (European Research Council, ERC); EMBL","We thank S.

Here we present a novel and generally applicable solution NMR technique, known as dark-state exchange saturation transfer (DEST), to probe such exchange phenomena with atomic resolution. This is illustrated by the exchange reaction between amyloid-beta (A beta) monomers and polydisperse, NMR-invisible ('dark') protofibrils, a process of significant interest because the accumulation of toxic, aggregated forms of A beta, from small oligomers to very large assemblies, has been implicated in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease(1-6). The (15)N-DEST experiment imprints with single-residue-resolution dynamic information on the protofibril-bound species in the form of (15)N transverse relaxation rates ((15)N-R(2)) and exchange kinetics between monomers and protofibrils onto the easily observed two-dimensional (1)H-(15)N correlation spectrum of the monomer. The exchanging species on the protofibril surface comprise an ensemble of sparsely populated states where each residue is either tethered to (through other residues) or in direct contact with the surface. The first eight residues exist predominantly in a mobile tethered state, whereas the largely hydrophobic central region and part of the carboxy (C)-terminal hydrophobic region are in direct contact with the protofibril surface for a significant proportion of the time. The C-terminal residues of both A beta 40 and A beta 42 display lower affinity for the protofibril surface, indicating that they are likely to be surface exposed rather than buried as in structures of A beta fibrils(7-10), and might therefore comprise the critical nucleus for fibril formation(11,12). The (15)N-R(2)(tethered) values, however, are significantly larger for the C-terminal residues of A beta 42 than A beta 40, which might explain the former's higher propensity for rapid aggregation and fibril formation(13,14).","[Fawzi, Nicolas L.; Ying, Jinfa; Clore, G.

Here we investigate the mechanism of the extraordinary selectivity of the human voltage-gated proton channel(1), H(V)1 (also known as HVCN1). This selectivity is essential to its ability to regulate reactive oxygen species production by leukocytes(2-4), histamine secretion by basophils(5), sperm capacitation(6), and airway pH(7). The most selective ion channel known, H(V)1 shows no detectable permeability to other ions(1). Opposing classes of selectivity mechanisms postulate that (1) a titratable amino acid residue in the permeation pathway imparts proton selectivity(1,8-11), or (2) water molecules 'frozen' in a narrow pore conduct protons while excluding other ions(12). Here we identify aspartate 112 as a crucial component of the selectivity filter of H(V)1. When a neutral amino acid replaced Asp 112, the mutant channel lost proton specificity and became anion-selective or did not conduct. Only the glutamate mutant remained proton-specific. Mutation of the nearby Asp 185 did not impair proton selectivity, indicating that Asp 112 has a unique role. Although histidine shuttles protons in other proteins, when histidine or lysine replaced Asp 112, the mutant channel was still anion-permeable. Evidently, the proton specificity of H(V)1 requires an acidic group at the selectivity filter.","[Musset, Boris; Morgan, Deri; Cherny, Vladimir V.; DeCoursey, Thomas E.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Biophys & Physiol, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Smith, Susan M.

Here we report efficient self-formation of three-dimensional adenohypophysis tissues in an aggregate culture of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells were stimulated to differentiate into non-neural head ectoderm and hypothalamic neuroectoderm in adjacent layers within the aggregate, and treated with hedgehog signalling. Self-organization of Rathke's-pouch-like three-dimensional structures occurred at the interface of these two epithelia, as seen in vivo, and various endocrine cells including corticotrophs and somatotrophs were subsequently produced. The corticotrophs efficiently secreted adrenocorticotropic hormone in response to corticotrophin releasing hormone and, when grafted in vivo, these cells rescued the systemic glucocorticoid level in hypopituitary mice. Thus, functional anterior pituitary tissue self-forms in ES cell culture, recapitulating local tissue interactions.","[Suga, Hidetaka; Kadoshima, Taisuke; Minaguchi, Maki; Soen, Mika; Nakano, Tokushige; Takata, Nozomu; Wataya, Takafumi; Muguruma, Keiko; Sasai, Yoshiki] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Neurogenesis & Organogenesis Grp, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Suga, Hidetaka; Ohgushi, Masatoshi] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Div Human Stem Cell Technol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Suga, Hidetaka; Oiso, Yutaka] Nagoya Univ, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi 4668550, Japan; [Miyoshi, Hiroyuki] RIKEN, Subteam Manipulat Cell Fate, BioResource Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Yonemura, Shigenobu] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Electron Microscopy Lab, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Sasai, Y (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Neurogenesis & Organogenesis Grp, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",yoshikisasai@cdb.riken.jp,"Miyoshi, Hiroyuki/G-9808-2013; SUGA, HIDETAKA/I-7452-2014",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Knowledge Cluster Initiative at Kobe; Leading Project for Realization of Regenerative Medicine","We are grateful to H.

Using electrophysiological and biochemical assays of neuronal protein synthesis in the hippocampus of Tsc2(+/-) and Fmr1(-/y) mice, here we show that synaptic dysfunction caused by these mutations actually falls at opposite ends of a physiological spectrum. Synaptic, biochemical and cognitive defects in these mutants are corrected by treatments that modulate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in opposite directions, and deficits in the mutants disappear when the mice are bred to carry both mutations. Thus, normal synaptic plasticity and cognition occur within an optimal range of metabotropic glutamate-receptor-mediated protein synthesis, and deviations in either direction can lead to shared behavioural impairments.","[Auerbach, Benjamin D.; Osterweil, Emily K.; Bear, Mark F.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Bear, MF (reprint author), MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mbear@mit.edu,,"Osterweil, Emily/0000-0003-0582-2284","National Institute of Mental Health [T32 MH-082718, T32-MH-074249]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [2R01HD046943]; Department of Defense [W81XWH-11-1-0252]; Simons Foundation","This work was partly supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (T32 MH-082718 and T32-MH-074249), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (2R01HD046943), the Department of Defense (W81XWH-11-1-0252) and The Simons Foundation.

In these events, the star develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an eccentric orbit, the bound debris falls into the black hole, forming an accretion disk and emitting radiation(4-6). The same process may occur on planetary scales if a minor body passes too close to its star. In the Solar System, comets fall directly into our Sun(7) or onto planets(8). If the star is a compact object, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. Indeed, one of the first mechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion of comets onto neutron stars in our Galaxy(9). Here we report that the peculiarities of the 'Christmas' gamma-ray burst (GRB 101225A(10)) can be explained by a tidal disruption event of a minor body around an isolated Galactic neutron star. This would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compact stellar remnants more frequently than occurs in the Solar System or that minor-body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. A peculiar supernova associated with a gamma-ray burst provides an alternative explanation(11).","[Campana, S.; D'Avanzo, P.; Tagliaferri, G.; Covino, S.; Ghirlanda, G.; Ghisellini, G.; Melandri, A.; Fugazza, D.; Sbarufatti, B.; Vergani, S.

They release ultra-relativistic jets, which produce non-thermal emission through synchrotron radiation as they interact with the surrounding medium(2). Here we report observations of the unusual GRB 101225A. Its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long-lived and was followed by a bright X-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual optical counterpart. During the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as an expanding, cooling black body, after which an additional component, consistent with a faint supernova, emerged. We estimate its redshift to be z = 0.33 by fitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the optical emission with a GRB-supernova template. Deep optical observations may have revealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. Our proposed progenitor is a merger of a helium star with a neutron star that underwent a common envelope phase, expelling its hydrogen envelope. The resulting explosion created a GRB-like jet which became thermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material, thus creating the observed black body, until finally the emission from the supernova dominated. An alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutron star in the Galaxy(3).","[Thoene, C.

Examples include superconductivity, superfluidity of He-3, the anomalous rotation of neutron stars, and the crossover between Bose-Einstein condensation of dimers and the BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) regime in strongly interacting Fermi gases. When confined to two dimensions, interacting many-body systems show even more subtle effects(1), many of which are not understood at a fundamental level. Most striking is the (as yet unexplained) phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, which is intimately related to the two-dimensional geometry of the crystal structure. In particular, it is not understood how the many-body pairing is established at high temperature, and whether it precedes superconductivity. Here we report the observation of a many-body pairing gap above the superfluid transition temperature in a harmonically trapped, two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas in the regime of strong coupling. Our measurements of the spectral function of the gas are performed using momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(2,3), analogous to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the solid state(4). Our observations mark a significant step in the emulation of layered two-dimensional strongly correlated superconductors using ultracold atomic gases.","[Feld, Michael; Froehlich, Bernd; Vogt, Enrico; Koschorreck, Marco; Koehl, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Kohl, M (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",mk540@cam.ac.uk,"Kohl, Michael/C-6114-2009; Koschorreck, Marco/D-1536-2009","Kohl, Michael/0000-0003-4055-713X; Koschorreck, Marco/0000-0003-0974-7007",EPSRC [EP/G029547/1]; Daimler-Benz Foundation; Studienstiftung; DAAD,"We thank A.

Given an elemental inventory of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, the identity of molecular species in gaseous volcanic emanations depends critically on the pressure (fugacity) of oxygen. Reduced melts having oxygen fugacities close to that defined by the iron-wustite buffer would yield volatile species such as CH4, H-2, H2S, NH3 and CO, whereas melts close to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer would be similar to present-day conditions and would be dominated by H2O, CO2, SO2 and N-2 (refs 1-4). Direct constraints on the oxidation state of terrestrial magmas before 3,850 Myr before present (that is, the Hadean eon) are tenuous because the rock record is sparse or absent. Samples from this earliest period of Earth's history are limited to igneous detrital zircons that pre-date the known rock record, with ages approaching similar to 4,400 Myr (refs 5-8). Here we report a redox-sensitive calibration to determine the oxidation state of Hadean magmatic melts that is based on the incorporation of cerium into zircon crystals. We find that the melts have average oxygen fugacities that are consistent with an oxidation state defined by the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer, similar to present-day conditions. Moreover, selected Hadean zircons (having chemical characteristics consistent with crystallization specifically from mantle-derived melts) suggest oxygen fugacities similar to those of Archaean and present-day mantle-derived lavas(2-4,9,10) as early as similar to 4,350 Myr before present. These results suggest that outgassing of Earth's interior later than similar to 200 Myr into the history of Solar System formation would not have resulted in a reducing atmosphere.","[Trail, Dustin; Watson, E.

However, how and why the Andes and their curvature, the Bolivian orocline, formed in the Cenozoic era (65.5 million years (Myr) ago to present), despite subduction continuing since the Mesozoic era(3) (251.0-65.5 Myr ago), is still unknown. Three-dimensional numerical subduction models demonstrate that variations in slab thickness, arising from the Nazca plate's age at the trench, produce a cordilleran morphology consistent with that observed(1,2). The age-dependent sinking of the slab in the mantle drives traction towards the trench at the base of the upper plate, causing it to thicken. Thus, subducting older Nazca plate below the Central Andes can explain the locally thickened crust and higher elevations. Here we demonstrate that resultant thickening of the South American plate modifies both shear force gradients and migration rates along the trench to produce a concave margin that matches the Bolivian orocline. Additionally, the varying forcing along the margin allows stress belts to form in the upper-plate interior, explaining the widening of the Central Andes and the different tectonic styles found on their margins, the Eastern and Western Cordilleras(2). The rise of the Central Andes and orocline formation are directly related to the local increase of Nazca plate age and an age distribution along the margin similar to that found today; the onset of these conditions only occurred in the Eocene epoch(4). This may explain the enigmatic delay of the Andean orogeny, that is, the formation of the modern Andes.","[Capitanio, F.

Within the brittle crust, the presence of frictionally weak minerals, fault-weakening high fluid pressures and chemical weakening are considered possible causes of an anomalously weak fault northwest of Parkfield(1-4). Non-volcanic tremor from lower-crustal and upper-mantle depths(5-7) is most pronounced about thirty kilometres southeast of Parkfield and is thought to be associated with high pore-fluid pressures at depth(8). Here we present geophysical evidence of fluids migrating into the creeping section of the San Andreas fault that seem to originate in the region of the uppermost mantle that also stimulates tremor, and evidence that along-strike variations in tremor activity and amplitude are related to strength variations in the lower crust and upper mantle. Interconnected fluids can explain a deep zone of anomalously low electrical resistivity that has been imaged by magnetotelluric data southwest of the Parkfield-Cholame segment. Near Cholame, where fluids seem to be trapped below a high-resistivity cap, tremor concentrates adjacent to the inferred fluids within a mechanically strong zone of high resistivity. By contrast, sub-vertical zones of low resistivity breach the entire crust near the drill hole of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth, northwest of Parkfield, and imply pathways for deep fluids into the eastern fault block, coincident with a mechanically weak crust and the lower tremor amplitudes in the lower crust. Fluid influx to the fault system is consistent with hypotheses of fault-weakening high fluid pressures in the brittle crust.","[Becken, Michael; Weckmann, Ute] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Bedrosian, Paul A.] US Geol Survey, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Becken, Michael; Ritter, Oliver; Weckmann, Ute] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","Becken, M (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Geophys, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",michael.becken@uni-muenster.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG); Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences,"This research was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences.

The expensive-tissue hypothesis(1) explains its evolution by proposing a trade-off between the size of the brain and that of the digestive tract, which is smaller than expected for a primate of our body size. Although this hypothesis is widely accepted, empirical support so far has been equivocal. Here we test it in a sample of 100 mammalian species, including 23 primates, by analysing brain size and organ mass data. We found that, controlling for fat-free body mass, brain size is not negatively correlated with the mass of the digestive tract or any other expensive organ, thus refuting the expensive-tissue hypothesis. Nonetheless, consistent with the existence of energy trade-offs with brain size, we find that the size of brains and adipose depots are negatively correlated in mammals, indicating that encephalization and fat storage are compensatory strategies to buffer against starvation. However, these two strategies can be combined if fat storage does not unduly hamper locomotor efficiency. We propose that human encephalization was made possible by a combination of stabilization of energy inputs and a redirection of energy from locomotion, growth and reproduction.","[Navarrete, Ana; van Schaik, Carel P.; Isler, Karin] Univ Zurich, Anthropol Inst & Museum, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Navarrete, A (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Anthropol Inst & Museum, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",a.navarrete@aim.uzh.ch; kisler@aim.uzh.ch,"Isler, Karin/A-9566-2008",,Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-117789]; A.H.

The known risk factors for melanoma include sun exposure, pigmentation and nevus phenotypes(1); risk factors associated with RCC include smoking, obesity and hypertension(2). A recent study of coexisting melanoma and RCC in the same patients supports a genetic predisposition underlying the association between these two cancers(3). The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) has been proposed to act as a melanoma oncogene(4); it also stimulates the transcription of hypoxia inducible factor(5) (HIF1A), the pathway of which is targeted by kidney cancer susceptibility genes(6). We therefore proposed that MITF might have a role in conferring a genetic predisposition to co-occurring melanoma and RCC. Here we identify a germline missense substitution in MITF (Mi-E318K) that occurred at a significantly higher frequency in genetically enriched patients affected with melanoma, RCC or both cancers, when compared with controls. Overall, Mi-E318K carriers had a higher than fivefold increased risk of developing melanoma, RCC or both cancers. Codon 318 is located in a small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) consensus site (Psi KXE) and Mi-E318K severely impaired SUMOylation of MITF. Mi-E318K enhanced MITF protein binding to the HIF1A promoter and increased its transcriptional activity compared to wild-type MITF. Further, we observed a global increase in Mi-E318K occupied loci. In an RCC cell line, gene expression profiling identified a Mi-E318K signature related to cell growth, proliferation and inflammation. Lastly, the mutant protein enhanced melanocytic and renal cell clonogenicity, migration and invasion, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Our data provide insights into the link between SUMOylation, transcription and cancer.","[Bertolotto, Corine; Giuliano, Sandy; Bille, Karine; Ballotti, Robert] C3M, Equipe Labelisee Ligue Canc, INSERM, U895,Equipe 1, F-06204 Nice, France;

Mutations in CDKN2A account for approximately 40% of familial cases(1), and predisposing mutations in CDK4 have been reported in a very small number of melanoma kindreds(2). Here we report the whole-genome sequencing of probands from several melanoma families, which we performed in order to identify other genes associated with familial melanoma. We identify one individual carrying a novel germline variant (coding DNA sequence c. G1075A; protein sequence p. E318K; rs149617956) in the melanoma-lineage-specific oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Although the variant co-segregated with melanoma in some but not all cases in the family, linkage analysis of 31 families subsequently identified to carry the variant generated a log of odds (lod) score of 2.7 under a dominant model, indicating E318K as a possible intermediate risk variant. Consistent with this, the E318K variant was significantly associated with melanoma in a large Australian case-control sample. Likewise, it was similarly associated in an independent case-control sample from the United Kingdom. In the Australian sample, the variant allele was significantly over-represented in cases with a family history of melanoma, multiple primary melanomas, or both. The variant allele was also associated with increased naevus count and non-blue eye colour. Functional analysis of E318K showed that MITF encoded by the variant allele had impaired sumoylation and differentially regulated several MITF targets. These data indicate that MITF is a melanoma-predisposition gene and highlight the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify novel rare variants associated with disease susceptibility.","[Zismann, Victoria; Trent, Jeffrey M.; Brown, Kevin M.] Translat Genom Res Inst, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Yokoyama, Satoru; Haq, Rizwan; Fisher, David E.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr,Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Woods, Susan L.; Boyle, Glen M.; Aoude, Lauren G.; MacGregor, Stuart; Gartside, Michael; Duffy, David L.; Holohan, Kelly; Dutton-Regester, Ken; Palmer, Jane M.; Bonazzi, Vanessa; Stark, Mitchell S.; Symmons, Judith; Law, Matthew H.; Schmidt, Christopher; Lanagan, Cathy; O'Connor, Linda; Whiteman, David C.; Montgomery, Grant W.; Martin, Nicholas G.; Hayward, Nicholas K.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Cust, Anne E.; Armstrong, Bruce K.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Harland, Mark; Taylor, John C.; Newton-Bishop, Julia A.; Bishop, D.

In the prevailing model of thermogenesis, when the hypothalamus senses cold temperatures it triggers sympathetic discharge, resulting in the release of noradrenaline in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue(4,5). Acting via the beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, noradrenaline induces lipolysis in white adipocytes(6), whereas it stimulates the expression of thermogenic genes, such as PPAR-gamma coactivator 1a (Ppargc1a), uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (Acsl1), in brown adipocytes(7-9). However, the precise nature of all the cell types involved in this efferent loop is not well established. Here we report in mice an unexpected requirement for the interleukin-4 (IL-4)-stimulated program of alternative macrophage activation in adaptive thermogenesis. Exposure to cold temperature rapidly promoted alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages, which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Absence of alternatively activated macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to cold, whereas administration of IL-4 increased thermogenic gene expression, fatty acid mobilization and energy expenditure, all in a macrophage dependent manner. Thus, we have discovered a role for alternatively activated macrophages in the orchestration of an important mammalian stress response, the response to cold.","[Nguyen, Khoa D.; Qiu, Yifu; Cui, Xiaojin; Goh, Y.

Wounds and tumours-a type of 'unhealed wound'(2)-generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through an NADPH oxidase (NOX). This extracellular H2O2 mediates recruitment of leukocytes, particularly the first responders of innate immunity, neutrophils, to injured tissue(3-6). However, the sensor that neutrophils use to detect the redox state at wounds is unknown. Here we identify the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn as a redox sensor that mediates initial neutrophil recruitment to wounds in zebrafish larvae. Lyn activation in neutrophils is dependent on wound-derived H2O2 after tissue injury, and inhibition of Lyn attenuates neutrophil wound recruitment. Inhibition of SFKs also disrupted H2O2-mediated chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils. In vitro analysis identified a single cysteine residue, C466, as being responsible for direct oxidation-mediated activation of Lyn. Furthermore, transgenic-tissue-specific reconstitution with wild-type Lyn and a cysteine mutant revealed that Lyn C466 is important for the neutrophil wound response and downstream signalling in vivo. This is the first identification, to our knowledge, of a physiological redox sensor that mediates leukocyte wound attraction in multicellular organisms.","[Starnes, Taylor W.; Deng, Qing; Huttenlocher, Anna] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Yoo, Sa Kan] Univ Wisconsin, Program Cellular & Mol Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Huttenlocher, Anna] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pediat, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Huttenlocher, A (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",huttenlocher@wisc.edu,"Deng, Qing/G-3923-2011","Deng, Qing/0000-0002-9254-9951","American Heart Association [11PRE4890041]; National Institutes of Health [GM074827, 5T32 HL07899]; UW MSTP","We thank K.

Yeast genetic screens have identified proteins required for different forms of selective autophagy, including cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting, pexophagy and mitophagy, and mammalian genetic screens have identified proteins required for autophagy regulation(5). However, there have been no systematic approaches to identify molecular determinants of selective autophagy in mammalian cells. Here, to identify mammalian genes required for selective autophagy, we performed a high-content, image-based, genome-wide small interfering RNA screen to detect genes required for the colocalization of Sindbis virus capsid protein with autophagolysosomes. We identified 141 candidate genes required for viral autophagy, which were enriched for cellular pathways related to messenger RNA processing, interferon signalling, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal motor function and metabolism. Ninety-six of these genes were also required for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, indicating that common molecular determinants may be involved in autophagic targeting of viral nucleocapsids and autophagic targeting of damaged mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking one of these gene products, the C2-domain containing protein, SMURF1, are deficient in the autophagosomal targeting of Sindbis and herpes simplex viruses and in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Moreover, SMURF1-deficient mice accumulate damaged mitochondria in the heart, brain and liver. Thus, our study identifies candidate determinants of selective autophagy, and defines SMURF1 as a newly recognized mediator of both viral autophagy and mitophagy.","[Orvedahl, Anthony; Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Zou, Zhongju; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Orvedahl, Anthony; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Zou, Zhongju; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xiao, Guanghua; Forst, Christian V.; Xie, Yang] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] Broad Inst Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ng, Aylwin; Xavier, Ramnik J.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Zou, Zhongju; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Tang, Yi; Zhang, Ying E.] NCI, Cellular & Mol Biol Lab, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Narimatsu, Masahiro; Wrana, Jeffrey L.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Ctr Syst Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Gilpin, Christopher; Luby-Phelps, Katherine] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Cell Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Roth, Michael] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Roth, Michael; Xie, Yang; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Harold C Simmons Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wrana, Jeffrey L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada","Levine, B (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",beth.levine@utsouthwestern.edu,"Wrana, Jeffrey/F-8857-2013; Zhang, Ying/G-3657-2015","Zhang, Ying/0000-0003-2753-7601; Roth, Michael/0000-0002-9056-332X","NIH [AI109617, CA84254, UL1 RR024982, AI062773, DK83756, DK086502, DK043351]; NSF [DMS-0907562]; Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute","We thank M.

In contrast to the established role of PKM2 in aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect(1-3), its non-metabolic functions remain elusive. Here we demonstrate, in human cancer cells, that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1, into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated Y333 of beta-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be recruited to the CCND1 promoter, leading to HDAC3 removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation and cyclin D1 expression. PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation is instrumental in EGFR-promoted tumour cell proliferation and brain tumour development. In addition, positive correlations have been identified between c-Src activity, beta-catenin Y333 phosphorylation and PKM2 nuclear accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of beta-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 have been correlated with grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. These findings reveal that EGF induces beta-catenin transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that induced by Wnt/Wingless(4) and highlight the essential non-metabolic functions of PKM2 in EGFR-promoted beta-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.","[Yang, Weiwei; Xia, Yan; Ji, Haitao; Zheng, Yanhua; Liang, Ji; Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Brain Tumor Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yang, Weiwei; Xia, Yan; Ji, Haitao; Zheng, Yanhua; Liang, Ji; Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Neurooncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Huang, Wenhua] Jiaxing Xinda Biotechnol Co, Jiaxing 314000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xiang] Nanjing Univ, Model Anim Res Ctr, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210061, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Aldape, Kenneth] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lu, Zhimin] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Lu, ZM (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Brain Tumor Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",zhiminlu@mdanderson.org,"Ji, Haitao/B-8204-2012; Ji, Haitao/L-1615-2013",,"National Cancer Institute [5R01CA109035, 5 P50 CA127001-03, CA16672]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) [RP110252]; American Cancer Society [RSG-09-277-01-CSM]; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center","We thank T.

Such cycles facilitate post-mitotic growth in many invertebrate and plant cells, and are so ubiquitous that they may account for up to half the world's biomass(3,4). DNA replication in endocycling Drosophila cells is triggered by cyclin E/cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CYCE/CDK2), but this kinase must be inactivated during each G-phase to allow the assembly of pre-Replication Complexes (preRCs) for the next S-phase(5,6). How CYCE/CDK2 is periodically silenced to allow re-replication has not been established. Here, using genetic tests in parallel with computational modelling, we show that the endocycles of Drosophila are driven by a molecular oscillator in which the E2F1 transcription factor promotes CycE expression and S-phase initiation, S-phase then activates the CRL4(CDT2) ubiquitin ligase, and this in turn mediates the destruction of E2F1 (ref. 7). We propose that it is the transient loss of E2F1 during S phases that creates the window of low Cdk activity required for preRC formation. In support of this model overexpressed E2F1 accelerated endocycling, whereas a stabilized variant of E2F1 blocked endocycling by de-regulating target genes, including CycE, as well as Cdk1 and mitotic cyclins. Moreover, we find that altering cell growth by changing nutrition or target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling impacts E2F1 translation, thereby making endocycle progression growth-dependent. Many of the regulatory interactions essential to this novel cell cycle oscillator are conserved in animals and plants(1,2,8), indicating that elements of this mechanism act in most growth-dependent cell cycles.","[Zielke, Norman; van Straaten, Monique; Edgar, Bruce A.] Univ Heidelberg ZMBH Alliance, Zentrum Mol Biol, German Canc Res Ctr DKFZ, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Zielke, Norman; Vuong Tran; Bravo, Maria-Jose; Woods, Brigitte; Edgar, Bruce A.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Kim, Kerry J.; von Dassow, George] Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Ctr Cell Dynam, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA; [Shibutani, Shusaku T.; Duronio, Robert J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Nagarajan, Sabarish; Grewal, Savraj S.] Univ Calgary, Clark H Smith Brain Tumor Ctr, So Alberta Canc Res Inst, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Nagarajan, Sabarish; Grewal, Savraj S.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Rottig, Carmen; Lehner, Christian F.] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol & Life Sci IMLS, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Edgar, BA (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg ZMBH Alliance, Zentrum Mol Biol, German Canc Res Ctr DKFZ, Neuenheimer Feld 282, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",b.edgar@dkfz.de,,,"NIH [GM51186, GM57859]; DAAD; NIGMS [5 P50 GM66050]; NSF [MCB0090835]; DFG [LE987/5-1]; CIHR [MOP-86622]","Supported by NIH GM51186 to B.

Although many multiphosphorylated targets have been identified, the dynamics and sequence of individual phosphorylation events within the multisite phosphorylation process have never been thoroughly studied. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of S phase is thought to be governed by complexes of Cdk1 and Cln cyclins that phosphorylate six or more sites on the Clb5-Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1, directing it to SCF-mediated destruction(1,5-8). The resulting Sic1-free Clb5-Cdk1 complex triggers S phase(9). Here, we demonstrate that Sic1 destruction depends on a more complex process in which both Cln2-Cdk1 and Clb5-Cdk1 act in processive multiphosphorylation cascades leading to the phosphorylation of a small number of specific phosphodegrons. The routes of these phosphorylation cascades are shaped by precisely oriented docking interactions mediated by cyclin-specific docking motifs in Sic1 and by Cks1, the phospho-adaptor subunit of Cdk1. Our results indicate that Clb5-Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation generates positive feedback that is required for switch-like Sic1 destruction. Our evidence for a docking network within clusters of phosphorylation sites uncovers a new level of complexity in Cdk1-dependent regulation of cell cycle transitions, and has general implications for the regulation of cellular processes by multisite phosphorylation.","[Koivomaegi, Mardo; Valk, Ervin; Venta, Rainis; Iofik, Anna; Lepiku, Martin; Loog, Mart] Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia; [Balog, Eva Rose M.; Rubin, Seth M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Morgan, David O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Loog, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia.",Mart.Loog@ut.ee,"Balog, Eva Rose/P-7661-2014","Balog, Eva Rose/0000-0001-6792-6914",Wellcome Trust [079014/Z/06/Z]; EMBO; HHMI [1253]; Estonian Science Foundation [6766]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0180071s07]; Norwegian government [08071N]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Cancer Institute,"We thank D.

In the zebrafish olfactory bulb, subsets of output neurons ( mitral cells) engage in synchronized oscillations during odour responses, but information about odour identity is contained mostly in non-oscillatory firing rate patterns. Using optogenetic manipulations and odour stimulation, we found that firing rate responses of neurons in the posterior zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), a target area homologous to olfactory cortex, were largely insensitive to oscillatory synchrony of mitral cells because passive membrane properties and synaptic currents act as low-pass filters. Nevertheless, synchrony influenced spike timing. Moreover, Dp neurons responded primarily during the decorrelated steady state of mitral cell activity patterns. Temporal filtering therefore tunes Dp neurons to components of mitral cell activity patterns that are particularly informative about precise odour identity. These results demonstrate how temporal filtering can extract specific information from multiplexed neuronal codes.","[Blumhagen, Francisca; Zhu, Peixin; Shum, Jennifer; Schaerer, Yan-Ping Zhang; Friedrich, Rainer W.] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Yaksi, Emre] Neuroelect Res Flanders, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Friedrich, Rainer W.] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland","Friedrich, RW (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",Rainer.Friedrich@fmi.ch,,,Novartis Research Foundation; Max-Planck-Society; Swiss National Fonds (SNF); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); Whitaker Foundation,"This work was supported by the Novartis Research Foundation, the Max-Planck-Society, the Swiss National Fonds (SNF), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP), and the Whitaker Foundation (J.S.).

A class of cloud formation models suggests that a large-scale galactic magnetic field is irrelevant at the scale of individual clouds, because the turbulence and rotation of a cloud may randomize the orientation of its magnetic field(1,2). Alternatively, galactic fields could be strong enough to impose their direction upon individual clouds(3,4), thereby regulating cloud accumulation and fragmentation(5), and affecting the rate and efficiency of star formation(6). Our location in the disk of the Galaxy makes an assessment of the situation difficult. Here we report observations of the magnetic field orientation of six giant molecular cloud complexes in the nearby, almost face-on, galaxy M33. The fields are aligned with the spiral arms, suggesting that the large-scale field in M33 anchors the clouds.","[Li, Hua-bai; Henning, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Li, HB (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astron, Konigstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",li@mpia.de,,,Max-Planck-Institut fur Astronomie and Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; Smithsonian Institution; Academia Sinica,"We thank E.

Quasi-circular areas of ice disruption called chaos terrains are unique to Europa, and both their formation and the ice-shell thickness depend on Europa's thermal state(1-5,7-17). No model so far has been able to explain why features such as Conamara Chaos stand above surrounding terrain and contain matrix domes(10,18). Melt-through of a thin ( few-kilometre) shell(3,7,8) is thermodynamically improbable and cannot raise the ice(10,18). The buoyancy of material rising as either plumes of warm, pure ice called diapirs(1,9-15) or convective cells(16,17) in a thick (> 10 kilometres) shell is insufficient to produce the observed chaos heights, and no single plume can create matrix domes(10,18). Here we report an analysis of archival data from Europa, guided by processes observed within Earth's subglacial volcanoes and ice shelves. The data suggest that chaos terrains form above liquid water lenses perched within the ice shell as shallow as 3 kilometres. Our results suggest that ice-water interactions and freeze-out give rise to the diverse morphologies and topography of chaos terrains. The sunken topography of Thera Macula indicates that Europa is actively resurfacing over a lens comparable in volume to the Great Lakes in North America.","[Schmidt, B. E.; Blankenship, D.

The supercooled liquid has been probed experimentally to near the homogeneous nucleation temperature, T approximate to 232 K, yet the mechanism of ice crystallization-including the size and structure of critical nuclei-has not yet been resolved. The heat capacity and compressibility of liquid water anomalously increase on moving into the supercooled region, according to power laws that would diverge ( that is, approach infinity) at similar to 225K (refs 1, 2), so there may be a link between water's thermodynamic anomalies and the crystallization rate of ice. But probing this link is challenging because fast crystallization prevents experimental studies of the liquid below T-H. And although atomistic studies have captured water crystallization(3), high computational costs have so far prevented an assessment of the rates and mechanism involved. Here we report coarse-grained molecular simulations with the mW water model(4) in the supercooled regime around TH which reveal that a sharp increase in the fraction of four-coordinated molecules in supercooled liquid water explains its anomalous thermodynamics and also controls the rate and mechanisms of ice formation. The results of the simulations and classical nucleation theory using experimental data suggest that the crystallization rate of water reaches a maximum around 225 K, below which ice nuclei form faster than liquid water can equilibrate. This implies a lower limit of metastability of liquid water just below TH and well above its glass transition temperature, 136 K. By establishing a relationship between the structural transformation in liquid water and its anomalous thermodynamics and crystallization rate, our findings also provide mechanistic insight into the observed(5) dependence of homogeneous ice nucleation rates on the thermodynamics of water.","[Moore, Emily B.; Molinero, Valeria] Univ Utah, Dept Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Molinero, V (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",Valeria.Molinero@utah.edu,,,Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation,This work was supported by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation through a Young Investigator Award to V.

Although observations show a more or less continuous decline for the past four or five decades(3,4), there are few long-term records with which to assess natural sea ice variability. Until now, the question of whether or not current trends are potentially anomalous(5) has therefore remained unanswerable. Here we use a network of high-resolution terrestrial proxies from the circum-Arctic region to reconstruct past extents of summer sea ice, and show that-although extensive uncertainties remain, especially before the sixteenth century-both the duration and magnitude of the current decline in sea ice seem to be unprecedented for the past 1,450 years. Enhanced advection of warm Atlantic water to the Arctic(6) seems to be the main factor driving the decline of sea ice extent on multidecadal timescales, and may result from nonlinear feedbacks between sea ice and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. These results reinforce the assertion that sea ice is an active component of Arctic climate variability and that the recent decrease in summer Arctic sea ice is consistent with anthropogenically forced warming.","[Kinnard, Christophe] Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, La Serena 1720170, Chile; [Zdanowicz, Christian M.; Fisher, David A.] Geol Survey Canada, NRCAN, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E8, Canada; [Isaksson, Elisabeth] FRAM High N Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Norwegian Polar Res Inst, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway; [de Vernal, Anne] Univ Quebec, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Thompson, Lonnie G.] Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Kinnard, C (reprint author), Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, Benavente 980,Casilla 554, La Serena 1720170, Chile.",christophe.kinnard@ceaza.cl,"de Vernal, Anne/D-5602-2013","de Vernal, Anne/0000-0001-5656-724X; Zdanowicz, Christian/0000-0002-1045-5063",Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (Polar Climate Stability Network); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This work was supported jointly by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (Polar Climate Stability Network) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,38,119,124,2,92,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Nov,2011,479,7374,,,,,509,U231,,10.1038/nature10581,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,851QI,WOS:000297285600046,22113692,No,,,11/20/17

Although the concentrations of the light elements are small, they nevertheless affect the Earth's core: its rate of cooling, the growth of the inner core, the dynamics of core convection, and the evolution of the geodynamo(3,4). Several light elements-including sulphur, oxygen, silicon, carbon and hydrogen-have been suggested(2), but the precise identity of the light elements in the Earth's core is still unclear. Oxygen has been proposed as a major light element in the core on the basis of cosmochemical arguments and chemical reactions during accretion(5,6). Its presence in the core has direct implications for Earth accretion conditions of oxidation state, pressure and temperature. Here we report new shockwave data in the Fe-S-O system that are directly applicable to the outer core. The data include both density and sound velocity measurements, which we compare with the observed density and velocity profiles of the liquid outer core. The results show that we can rule out oxygen as a major light element in the liquid outer core because adding oxygen into liquid iron would not reproduce simultaneously the observed density and sound velocity profiles of the outer core. An oxygen-depleted core would imply a more reduced environment during early Earth accretion.","[Fei, Yingwei] Carnegie Inst Washington, Geophys Lab, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Huang, Haijun; Jing, Fuqian; Hu, Xiaojun] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fei, Yingwei] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Cai, Lingcang; Jing, Fuqian] China Acad Engn Phys, Inst Fluid Phys, Natl Key Lab Shock Wave & Detonat Phys, Mianyang 621900, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Xie, Hongsen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, Guiyang 550002, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lianmeng] Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synth & Proc, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Gong, Zizheng] Beijing Inst Spacecraft Environm Engn, Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Reliabil & Environm En, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China","Fei, YW (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Geophys Lab, 5251 Broad Branch Rd NW, Washington, DC 20015 USA.",fei@gl.ciw.edu,"Fei, Yingwei/F-3709-2011","Fei, Yingwei/0000-0001-9955-5353","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41074056, 40604007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Basic Research of China [2010CB731600]; National Science Foundation [EAR-0809539]; Carnegie Institution of Washington","We thank C.

Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals(5). Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas(6). We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 degrees C of the effective increase of 1.07 degrees C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 degrees C of the 1.11 degrees C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms(7), the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes(8,9), and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition(10).","[Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [de Ruffray, Patrice] Univ Strasbourg UDS, Inst Biol Mol Plantes IBMP, CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Vidal, Claude] Inventaire Forestier Natl, F-45290 Nogent Sur Marne, France","Bertrand, R (reprint author), AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, 14 Rue Girardet, F-54000 Nancy, France.",romain.bertrand@engref.agroparistech.fr,,,"French Institute of Agricultural, Forest and Environmental Engineering (ENGREF, AgroParisTech); National Forest Department (ONF); French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME); Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences [272-07-0242]; ADEME; Regional Council of Lorraine","We thank J.-D.

However, the actual physical evidence for modern humans is extremely rare, and direct dates reach no farther back than about 41-39 kyr cal BP, leaving a gap. Here we show, using stratigraphic, chronological and archaeological data, that a fragment of human maxilla from the Kent's Cavern site, UK, dates to the earlier period. The maxilla (KC4), which was excavated in 1927, was initially diagnosed as Upper Palaeolithic modern human(1). In 1989, it was directly radiocarbon dated by accelerator mass spectrometry to 36.4-34.7 kyr cal BP2. Using a Bayesian analysis of new ultrafiltered bone collagen dates in an ordered stratigraphic sequence at the site, we show that this date is a considerable underestimate. Instead, KC4 dates to 44.2-41.5 kyr cal BP. This makes it older than any other equivalently dated modern human specimen and directly contemporary with the latest European Neanderthals, thus making its taxonomic attribution crucial. We also show that in 13 dental traits KC4 possesses modern human rather than Neanderthal characteristics; three other traits show Neanderthal affinities and a further seven are ambiguous. KC4 therefore represents the oldest known anatomically modern human fossil in northwestern Europe, fills a key gap between the earliest dated Aurignacian remains and the earliest human skeletal remains, and demonstrates the wide and rapid dispersal of early modern humans across Europe more than 40 kyr ago.","[Higham, Tom] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Compton, Tim; Stringer, Chris; Jacobi, Roger; Collins, Chris] Nat Hist Museum, London SW7 5BD, England; [Jacobi, Roger] British Museum, Dept Prehist & Europe, Quaternary Sect, London N1 5QJ, England; [Shapiro, Beth] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Trinkaus, Erik] Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Chandler, Barry] Torquay Museum, Torquay TQ1 1HG, Devon, England; [Groening, Flora; Fagan, Michael] Univ Hull, Dept Engn, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, Yorks, England; [Hillson, Simon] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London WC1H 0PY, England; [O'Higgins, Paul] Univ York, Hull York Med Sch, Ctr Anat & Human Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [FitzGerald, Charles] McMaster Univ, Dept Anthropol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L9, Canada","Higham, T (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",thomas.higham@rlaha.ox.ac.uk; c.stringer@nhm.ac.uk,"Groning, Flora/C-2220-2012","Groning, Flora/0000-0002-8127-4112; Shapiro, Beth/0000-0002-2733-7776",NERC [NE/D014077/1]; Leverhulme Trust,"We thank R.

Most researchers accept that before the arrival of anatomically modern humans, Neanderthals had adopted several 'transitional' technocomplexes. Two of these, the Uluzzian of southern Europe and the Chatelperronian of western Europe, are key to current interpretations regarding the timing of arrival of anatomically modern humans in the region and their potential interaction with Neanderthal populations. They are also central to current debates regarding the cognitive abilities of Neanderthals and the reasons behind their extinction(1-6). However, the actual fossil evidence associated with these assemblages is scant and fragmentary(7-10), and recent work has questioned the attribution of the Chatelperronian to Neanderthals on the basis of taphonomic mixing and lithic analysis(11,12). Here we reanalyse the deciduous molars from the Grotta del Cavallo ( southern Italy), associated with the Uluzzian and originally classified as Neanderthal(13,14). Using two independent morphometric methods based on microtomographic data, we show that the Cavallo specimens can be attributed to anatomically modern humans. The secure context of the teeth provides crucial evidence that the makers of the Uluzzian technocomplex were therefore not Neanderthals. In addition, new chronometric data for the Uluzzian layers of Grotta del Cavallo obtained from associated shell beads and included within a Bayesian age model show that the teeth must date to similar to 45,000-43,000 calendar years before present. The Cavallo human remains are therefore the oldest known European anatomically modern humans, confirming a rapid dispersal of modern humans across the continent before the Aurignacian and the disappearance of Neanderthals.","[Benazzi, Stefano; Fornai, Cinzia; Weber, Gerhard W.] Univ Vienna, Dept Anthropol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Douka, Katerina] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol Hist Art, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Bauer, Catherine C.; Harvati, Katerina] Univ Tubingen, Dept Early Prehist & Quaternary Ecol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Kullmer, Ottmar] Senckenberg Res Inst Frankfurt, Dept Paleoanthropol & Messel Res, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Svoboda, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Archaeol, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Svoboda, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Anthropol, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Pap, Ildiko] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Anthropol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Mallegni, Francesco] Univ Pisa, Dept Biol, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Bayle, Priscilla] Univ Bordeaux 1, UMR PACEA 5199, F-33405 Talence, France; [Coquerelle, Michael] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Paleobiol, Paleoanthropol Grp, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Condemi, Silvana] Fac Med Marseille, CNRS, Sect Nord, UMR 6578,EFS,Lab Anthropol Bioculturelle, F-13344 Marseille 15, France; [Ronchitelli, Annamaria] Univ Siena, Dept Environm Sci G Sarfatti, UR Prehist Ecol, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Harvati, Katerina] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoecol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany","Benazzi, S (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Dept Anthropol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",stefano.benazzi@univie.ac.at,"Harvati, Katerina/A-5197-2008; Weber, Gerhard/F-2583-2010","Weber, Gerhard/0000-0002-8542-6259; Coquerelle, Michael/0000-0001-5183-3297; Benazzi, Stefano/0000-0003-4305-6920; Douka, Katerina/0000-0002-0558-0011",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) NRCF; Leverhulme Trust; NSF [01-120]; A.E.R.S.

More than two billion people are infected with geohelminths, including the roundworms Ascaris (common roundworm), Necator and Ancylostoma (hookworms), and Trichuris (whipworm), mainly in developing or impoverished nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America(1). In humans, the diseases caused by these parasites result in about 135,000 deaths annually, with a global burden comparable with that of malaria or tuberculosis in disability-adjusted life years(1). Ascaris alone infects around 1.2 billion people and, in children, causes nutritional deficiency, impaired physical and cognitive development and, in severe cases, death(2). Ascaris also causes major production losses in pigs owing to reduced growth, failure to thrive and mortality(2). The Ascaris-swine model makes it possible to study the parasite, its relationship with the host, and ascariasis at the molecular level. To enable such molecular studies, we report the 273 mega-base draft genome of Ascaris suum and compare it with other nematode genomes. This genome has low repeat content (4.4%) and encodes about 18,500 protein-coding genes. Notably, the A. suum secretome (about 750 molecules) is rich in peptidases linked to the penetration and degradation of host tissues, and an assemblage of molecules likely to modulate or evade host immune responses. This genome provides a comprehensive resource to the scientific community and underpins the development of new and urgently needed interventions (drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests) against ascariasis and other nematodiases.","[Jex, Aaron R.; Young, Neil D.; Hall, Ross S.; Anderson, Garry A.; Campbell, Bronwyn E.; Cantacessi, Cinzia; Gasser, Robin B.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Liu, Shiping; Li, Bo; Li, Yingrui; Yang, Linfeng; Zeng, Na; Xu, Xun; Xiong, Zijun; Chen, Fangyuan; Wu, Xuan; Zhang, Guojie; Fang, Xiaodong; Kang, Yi; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun; Wang, Jian] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Harris, Todd W.] MaRS Ctr, Ontario Inst Canc Res, Toronto, ON M5G 0A3, Canada; [Vlaminck, Johnny; Wang, Tao; Geldhof, Peter] Univ Ghent, Lab Parasitol & Parasit Dis, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Schwarz, Erich M.; Sternberg, Paul W.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ranganathan, Shoba] Macquarie Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Nejsum, Peter] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Life Sci, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Jex, AR (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",ajex@unimelb.edu.au; wangjun@genomics.org.cn; wangjian@genomics.org.cn; robinbg@unimelb.edu.au,"; Zhang, Guojie/B-6188-2014; Cantacessi, Cinzia/B-7356-2014; Rivet, Catherine/M-7978-2014; Li, Yingrui/K-1064-2015; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016","Young, Neil/0000-0001-8756-229X; Gasser, Robin/0000-0002-4423-1690; Nejsum, Peter/0000-0002-6673-8505; Zhang, Guojie/0000-0001-6860-1521; Cantacessi, Cinzia/0000-0001-6863-2950; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Ranganathan, Shoba/0000-0002-8290-813X; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Wang, Tao/0000-0003-1359-8913; Schwarz, Erich/0000-0003-3151-4381; Sternberg, Paul/0000-0002-7699-0173",Australian Research Council; Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative on its Peak Computing Facility at the University of Melbourne [VR0007],"This project was funded by the Australian Research Council.

At least 50 per cent of the human genome is derived from retrotransposons, with three active families (L1, Alu and SVA) associated with insertional mutagenesis and disease(2,3). Epigenetic and post-transcriptional suppression block retrotransposition in somatic cells(4,5), excluding early embryo development and some malignancies(6,7). Recent reports of L1 expression(8,9) and copy number variation(10,11) in the human brain suggest that L1 mobilization may also occur during later development. However, the corresponding integration sites have not been mapped. Here we apply a high-throughput method to identify numerous L1, Alu and SVA germline mutations, as well as 7,743 putative somatic L1 insertions, in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of three individuals. Surprisingly, we also found 13,692 somatic Alu insertions and 1,350 SVA insertions. Our results demonstrate that retrotransposons mobilize to protein-coding genes differentially expressed and active in the brain. Thus, somatic genome mosaicism driven by retrotransposition may reshape the genetic circuitry that underpins normal and abnormal neurobiological processes.","[Baillie, J.

These pathogenic immune cells derive from progenitors that are normal, innocuous components of the healthy immune repertoire but become autoaggressive upon pathological activation. The stimuli triggering this autoimmune conversion have been commonly attributed to environmental factors, in particular microbial infection(2). However, using the relapsing-remitting mouse model of spontaneously developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(3), here we show that the commensal gut flora-in the absence of pathogenic agents-is essential in triggering immune processes, leading to a relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease driven by myelin-specific CD4(+) T cells. We show further that recruitment and activation of autoantibody-producing B cells from the endogenous immune repertoire depends on availability of the target autoantigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and commensal microbiota. Our observations identify a sequence of events triggering organ-specific autoimmune disease and these processes may offer novel therapeutic targets.","[Berer, Kerstin; Mues, Marsilius; Koutrolos, Michail; Al Rasbi, Zakeya; Boziki, Marina; Wekerle, Hartmut; Krishnamoorthy, Gurumoorthy] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, Dept Neuroimmunol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Johner, Caroline] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany","Wekerle, H (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, Dept Neuroimmunol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",hwekerle@neuro.mpg.de; guru@neuro.mpg.de,"Krishnamoorthy, Gurumoorthy/O-1650-2013","Krishnamoorthy, Gurumoorthy/0000-0002-7798-6707",German Competence Network on Multiple Sclerosis (KKNMS); ARSEP (France); Max Planck Society; Emirates Foundation; Hellenic Neurological Society;  [SFB 571],"We thank I.

This process, called lymphocyte recirculation, provides the body with effective immune surveillance for foreign invaders and for alterations to the body's own cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate lymphocyte recirculation during homeostasis remain incompletely characterized. Here we show that dendritic cells (DCs), which are well known for their role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes(3), control the entry of naive lymphocytes to lymph nodes by modulating the phenotype of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which are blood vessels specialized in lymphocyte recruitment(2,4,5). We found that in vivo depletion of CD11c(+) DCs in adult mice over a 1-week period induces a reduction in the size and cellularity of the peripheral and mucosal lymph nodes. In the absence of DCs, the mature adult HEV phenotype reverts to an immature neonatal phenotype, and HEV-mediated lymphocyte recruitment to lymph nodes is inhibited. Co-culture experiments showed that the effect of DCs on HEV endothelial cells is direct and requires lymphotoxin-beta-receptor-dependent signalling. DCs express lymphotoxin, and DC-derived lymphotoxin is important for lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes in vivo. Together, our results reveal a previously unsuspected role for DCs in the regulation of lymphocyte recirculation during immune surveillance.","[Moussion, Christine; Girard, Jean-Philippe] CNRS, Inst Pharmacol & Biol Struct, F-31077 Toulouse, France; [Moussion, Christine; Girard, Jean-Philippe] Univ Toulouse, UPS, Inst Pharmacol & Biol Struct, F-31077 Toulouse, France","Girard, JP (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Pharmacol & Biol Struct, 205 Route Narbonne, F-31077 Toulouse, France.",Jean-Philippe.Girard@ipbs.fr,"GIRARD, Jean-Philippe/F-5229-2010",,Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC) [8505]; French Ministry of Research; Fondation RITC,"We are grateful to S.

Senescent cells communicate with their environment by secreting various cytokines and growth factors, and it was reported that this 'secretory phenotype' can have pro-as well as anti-tumorigenic effects(2-5). Here we show that oncogene-induced senescence occurs in otherwise normal murine hepatocytes in vivo. Pre-malignant senescent hepatocytes secrete chemo- and cytokines and are subject to immune-mediated clearance (designated as 'senescence surveillance'), which depends on an intact CD4(+) T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response. Impaired immune surveillance of pre-malignant senescent hepatocytes results in the development of murine hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), thus showing that senescence surveillance is important for tumour suppression in vivo. In accordance with these observations, ras-specific Th1 lymphocytes could be detected in mice, in which oncogene-induced senescence had been triggered by hepatic expression of Nras(G12V). We also found that CD4(+) T cells require monocytes/macrophages to execute the clearance of senescent hepatocytes. Our study indicates that senescence surveillance represents an important extrinsic component of the senescence anti-tumour barrier, and illustrates how the cellular senescence program is involved in tumour immune surveillance by mounting specific immune responses against antigens expressed in pre-malignant senescent cells.","[Kang, Tae-Won; Yevsa, Tetyana; Hoenicke, Lisa; Wuestefeld, Torsten; Dauch, Daniel; Hohmeyer, Anja; Gereke, Marcus; Rudalska, Ramona; Potapova, Anna; Weiss, Siegfried; Bruder, Dunja; Zender, Lars] Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Yevsa, Tetyana; Woller, Norman; Wuestefeld, Torsten; Hohmeyer, Anja; Manns, Michael; Zender, Lars] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endocrinol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Iken, Marcus; Ott, Michael] Twincore Ctr Expt & Clin Infect Res, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Vucur, Mihael; Tacke, Frank; Luedde, Tom] Univ Hosp Aachen, Dept Internal Med 3, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Heikenwalder, Mathias] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Pathol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Heikenwalder, Mathias] Tech Univ Munich, Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Virol, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Khan, Sadaf; Gil, Jesus] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, London W12 0NN, England; [Schirmacher, Peter; Longerich, Thomas] Univ Heidelberg, Inst Pathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kubicka, Stefan] Dist Hosp Reutlingen, Clin Internal Med, D-72764 Reutlingen, Germany","Zender, L (reprint author), Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Inhoffenstr 7, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany.",Lars.Zender@helmholtz-hzi.de,"; Gil, Jesus/C-7739-2012","Woller, Norman/0000-0002-4928-0117; Gil, Jesus/0000-0002-4303-6260","Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres [VH-NG-424]; German Research Foundation, DFG [ZE 545/2-1, SFB/TRR77]; Wilhelm Sander Stiftung; Bear Necessities Pediatric Cancer Foundation; Federal German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF); European Commission","We thank D.

However, how syntaxin-1A is sequestered is unknown. Here we show that syntaxin clustering is mediated by electrostatic interactions with the strongly anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Using super-resolution stimulated-emission depletion microscopy on the plasma membranes of PC12 cells, we found that PIP2 is the dominant inner-leaflet lipid in microdomains about 73 nanometres in size. This high accumulation of PIP2 was required for syntaxin-1A sequestering, as destruction of PIP2 by the phosphatase synaptojanin-1 reduced syntaxin-1A clustering. Furthermore, coreconstitution of PIP2 and the carboxy-terminal part of syntaxin-1A in artificial giant unilamellar vesicles resulted in segregation of PIP2 and syntaxin-1A into distinct domains even when cholesterol was absent. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic protein-lipid interactions can result in the formation of microdomains independently of cholesterol or lipid phases.","[van den Bogaart, Geert; Amin, Hayder; Dier, Markus; Jahn, Reinhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Neurobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Meyenberg, Karsten; Hubrich, Barbara E.; Diederichsen, Ulf] Univ Gottingen, Inst Organ & Biomol Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Risselada, H.

Here we use ancient DNA, species distribution models and the human fossil record to elucidate how climate and humans shaped the demographic history of woolly rhinoceros, woolly mammoth, wild horse, reindeer, bison and musk ox. We show that climate has been a major driver of population change over the past 50,000 years. However, each species responds differently to the effects of climatic shifts, habitat redistribution and human encroachment. Although climate change alone can explain the extinction of some species, such as Eurasian musk ox and woolly rhinoceros, a combination of climatic and anthropogenic effects appears to be responsible for the extinction of others, including Eurasian steppe bison and wild horse. We find no genetic signature or any distinctive range dynamics distinguishing extinct from surviving species, emphasizing the challenges associated with predicting future responses of extant mammals to climate and human-mediated habitat change.","[Lorenzen, Eline D.; Orlando, Ludovic; Weinstock, Jaco; Binladen, Jonas; Gilbert, M.

The histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) complex, composed of ASH-2, WDR-5 and the histone methyltransferase SET-2, regulates Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Here we show that deficiencies in the H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers ASH-2, WDR-5 or SET-2 in the parental generation extend the lifespan of descendants up until the third generation. The transgenerational inheritance of lifespan extension by members of the ASH-2 complex is dependent on the H3K4me3 demethylase RBR-2, and requires the presence of a functioning germline in the descendants. Transgenerational inheritance of lifespan is specific for the H3K4me3 methylation complex and is associated with epigenetic changes in gene expression. Thus, manipulation of specific chromatin modifiers only in parents can induce an epigenetic memory of longevity in descendants.","[Greer, Eric L.; Maures, Travis J.; Ucar, Duygu; Hauswirth, Anna G.; Mancini, Elena; Lim, Jana P.; Benayoun, Berenice A.; Brunet, Anne] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Greer, Eric L.; Shi, Yang] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Greer, Eric L.; Shi, Yang] Childrens Hosp, Div Newborn Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Brunet, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, 300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",anne.brunet@stanford.edu,"Benayoun, Berenice/K-7048-2012","Benayoun, Berenice/0000-0002-7401-4777; Ucar, Duygu/0000-0002-9772-3066; Greer, Eric/0000-0002-7501-7371","NIH [R01-AG31198, ARRA-AG31198, R01-GM058012, F32-AG037254, T32-MH020016]; NSF; Helen Hay Whitney Post-Doctoral fellowship;  [T32-CA009361]","We are grateful to J.

The first type, iron-core-collapse supernovae, occurs when a high-mass star develops a degenerate iron core that exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit(2). The second type, electron-capture supernovae, is associated with the collapse of a lower-mass oxygen-neon-magnesium core as it loses pressure support owing to the sudden capture of electrons by neon and/or magnesium nuclei(3,4). It has hitherto been impossible to identify the two distinct families of neutron stars produced in these formation channels. Here we report that a large, well-known class of neutron-star-hosting X-ray pulsars is actually composed of two distinct subpopulations with different characteristic spin periods, orbital periods and orbital eccentricities. This class, the Be/X-ray binaries, contains neutron stars that accrete material from a more massive companion star(5). The two subpopulations are most probably associated with the two distinct types of neutron-star-forming supernova, with electron-capture supernovae preferentially producing systems with short spin periods, short orbital periods and low eccentricities. Intriguingly, the split between the two subpopulations is clearest in the distribution of the logarithm of spin period, a result that had not been predicted and which still remains to be explained.","[Knigge, Christian; Coe, Malcolm J.] Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Podsiadlowski, Philipp] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England","Knigge, C (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",c.knigge@soton.ac.uk,,,UK Science and Technology Facilities Council,Research support for this project was provided by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council.

In fact, quantum theory predicts that it teems with virtual particles flitting in and out of existence. Although initially a curiosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had measurable consequences-for instance, producing the Lamb shift(1) of atomic spectra and modifying the magnetic moment of the electron(2). This type of renormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding of nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence of vacuum fluctuations. From early on, it was discussed whether it might be possible to more directly observe the virtual particles that compose the quantum vacuum. Forty years ago, it was suggested(3) that a mirror undergoing relativistic motion could convert virtual photons into directly observable real photons. The phenomenon, later termed the dynamical Casimir effect(4,5), has not been demonstrated previously. Here we observe the dynamical Casimir effect in a superconducting circuit consisting of a coplanar transmission line with a tunable electrical length. The rate of change of the electrical length can be made very fast (a substantial fraction of the speed of light) by modulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device at high frequencies (>10 gigahertz). In addition to observing the creation of real photons, we detect two-mode squeezing in the emitted radiation, which is a signature of the quantum character of the generation process.","[Wilson, C.

This is particularly important in polycrystalline materials, in which the grain boundaries have profound implications for the properties and applications of the final material(2). However, such atomic resolution is still extremely difficult to achieve, partly because grain boundaries are effective sinks for atomic defects and impurities(3-5), which may drive structural transformation of grain boundaries and consequently modify material properties(6,7). Regardless of the origin of these sinks, the interplay between defects and grain boundaries complicates our efforts to pinpoint the exact sites and chemistries of the entities present in the defective regions, thereby limiting our understanding of how specific defects mediate property changes. Here we show that the combination of advanced electron microscopy, spectroscopy and first-principles calculations can provide three-dimensional images of complex, multicomponent grain boundaries with both atomic resolution and chemical sensitivity. The high resolution of these techniques allows us to demonstrate that even for magnesium oxide, which has a simple rock-salt structure, grain boundaries can accommodate complex ordered defect superstructures that induce significant electron trapping in the bandgap of the oxide. These results offer insights into interactions between defects and grain boundaries in ceramics and demonstrate that atomic-scale analysis of complex multicomponent structures in materials is now becoming possible.","[Wang, Zhongchang; Saito, Mitsuhiro; McKenna, Keith P.; Gu, Lin; Tsukimoto, Susumu; Shluger, Alexander L.; Ikuhara, Yuichi] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res, World Premier Int Res Ctr, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [McKenna, Keith P.; Shluger, Alexander L.] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [McKenna, Keith P.; Shluger, Alexander L.] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Ikuhara, Yuichi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Ikuhara, Yuichi] Japan Fine Ceram Ctr, Nanostruct Res Lab, Atsuta Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4568587, Japan","Wang, ZC (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res, World Premier Int Res Ctr, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",zcwang@wpi-aimr.tohoku.ac.jp,"Tsukimoto, Susumu/G-5194-2010; Ikuhara, Yuichi/F-3066-2010; Saito, Mitsuhiro/A-4859-2010; Gu, Lin/D-9631-2011; McKenna, Keith/A-5084-2010; Ikuhara, Yuichi/N-1001-2015","Gu, Lin/0000-0002-7504-031X; Ikuhara, Yuichi/0000-0003-3886-005X","MEXT, Japan [474]; IZUMI Science Foundation; MURATA Science Foundation; Nippon Sheet Glass Foundation;  [22760500];  [23560817];  [22740192]","This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area ""Atomic Scale Modification (474)"" from MEXT, Japan.

In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback(4,5). This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead(5). Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner(6,7). Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85 +/- 0.44 K (mean +/- one standard deviation) northwards of 45 degrees N and 0.21 +/- 0.53 K southwards. Below 35 degrees N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models(8).","[Lee, Xuhui; Zhao, Lei] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Goulden, Michael L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Hollinger, David Y.] US Forest Serv, USDA, No Res Stn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Barr, Alan] Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Black, T.

Their high elevation and youthful Alpine topography, combined with their location on the East Antarctic craton, creates a paradox that has puzzled researchers since the mountains were discovered in 1958(1). The preservation of Alpine topography in the Gamburtsevs(2) may reflect extremely low long-term erosion rates beneath the ice sheet(3), but the mountains' origin remains problematic. Here we present the first comprehensive view of the crustal architecture and uplift mechanisms for the Gamburtsevs, derived from radar, gravity and magnetic data. The geophysical data define a 2,500-km-long rift system in East Antarctica surrounding the Gamburtsevs, and a thick crustal root(4) beneath the range. We propose that the root formed during the Proterozoic assembly of interior East Antarctica (possibly about 1 Gyr ago), was preserved as in some old orogens(5,6) and was rejuvenated during much later Permian (roughly 250 Myr ago) and Cretaceous (roughly 100 Myr ago) rifting. Much like East Africa(7), the interior of East Antarctica is a mosaic of Precambrian provinces affected by rifting processes. Our models show that the combination of rift-flank uplift, root buoyancy and the isostatic response to fluvial and glacial erosion explains the high elevation and relief of the Gamburtsevs. The evolution of the Gamburtsevs demonstrates that rifting and preserved orogenic roots can produce broad regions of high topography in continental interiors without significantly modifying the underlying Precambrian lithosphere.","[Ferraccioli, Fausto; Jordan, Tom A.; Anderson, Lester M.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Finn, Carol A.] US Geol Survey, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Bell, Robin E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Damaske, Detlef] Bundesanstalt Geowissensch & Rohstoffe, D-30655 Hannover, Germany","Ferraccioli, F (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",ffe@bas.ac.uk,,"Jordan, Tom/0000-0003-2780-1986",AGAP International Polar Year; Federal Institute for Geosciences and Resources; Australian Antarctic Division,"We acknowledge the seven nations involved in the AGAP International Polar Year effort for their major logistical, financial and intellectual support.

It is widely assumed that species often diverge rapidly early in their evolution, and that this is followed by a longer, drawn-out period of slower evolutionary fine-tuning as natural selection fits organisms into an increasingly occupied niche space(1,2). But recent studies have hinted that the process may not be so simple(3-5). Here we apply statistical methods that automatically detect temporal shifts in the rate of evolution through time to a comprehensive mammalian phylogeny(6) and data set(7) of body sizes of 3,185 extant species. Unexpectedly, the majority of mammal species, including two of the most speciose orders (Rodentia and Chiroptera), have no history of substantial and sustained increases in the rates of evolution. Instead, a subset of the mammals has experienced an explosive increase (between 10- and 52-fold) in the rate of evolution along the single branch leading to the common ancestor of their monophyletic group (for example Chiroptera), followed by a quick return to lower or background levels. The remaining species are a taxonomically diverse assemblage showing a significant, sustained increase or decrease in their rates of evolution. These results necessarily decouple morphological diversification from speciation and suggest that the processes that give rise to the morphological diversity of a class of animals are far more free to vary than previously considered. Niches do not seem to fill up, and diversity seems to arise whenever, wherever and at whatever rate it is advantageous.","[Venditti, Chris] Univ Hull, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6BX, Berks, England; [Pagel, Mark] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Venditti, C (reprint author), Univ Hull, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",c.venditti@hull.ac.uk; m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,,,"Leverhulme Trust [ECF/2009/0029]; Natural Environment Research Council, UK; European Research Council","This research was supported by a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship (ECF/2009/0029) to C.

In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons(4-6). Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery(7,8) to cognitive centres(9), neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system(10,11). However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues(12,13). To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses(14,15). Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly(11,16).","[Smear, Matthew; Shusterman, Roman; O'Connor, Rodney; Bozza, Thomas; Rinberg, Dmitry] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Smear, Matthew; Bozza, Thomas] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Rinberg, D (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",bozza@northwestern.edu; rinbergd@janelia.hhmi.org,"Shusterman, Roman/B-9514-2008","Shusterman, Roman/0000-0002-1081-2884; O'Connor, Rodney/0000-0002-3916-3101","JFRC; NIDCD [R01DC009640, R21DC010911]; Whitehall Foundation; Brain Research Foundation","We thank L.

Allelic variation and extensive polymorphism within the three-domain KIR family (KIR3D, domains D0-D1-D2) affects pHLA binding specificity and is linked to the control of viral replication and the treatment outcome of certain haematological malignancies(1-3). Here we describe the structure of a human KIR3DL1 receptor bound to HLA-B*5701 complexed with a self-peptide. KIR3DL1 clamped around the carboxy-terminal end of the HLA-B*5701 antigen-binding cleft, resulting in two discontinuous footprints on the pHLA. First, the D0 domain, a distinguishing feature of the KIR3D family, extended towards beta 2-microglobulin and abutted a region of the HLA molecule with limited polymorphism, thereby acting as an 'innate HLA sensor' domain. Second, whereas the D2-HLAB*5701 interface exhibited a high degree of complementarity, the D1-pHLA-B*5701 contacts were suboptimal and accommodated a degree of sequence variation both within the peptide and the polymorphic region of the HLA molecule. Although the two-domain KIR (KIR2D) and KIR3DL1 docked similarly onto HLA-C(4,5) and HLA-B respectively, the corresponding D1-mediated interactions differed markedly, thereby providing insight into the specificity of KIR3DL1 for discrete HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes. Collectively, in association with extensive mutagenesis studies at the KIR3DL1-pHLA-B*5701 interface, we provide a framework for understanding the intricate interplay between peptide variability, KIR3D and HLA polymorphism in determining the specificity requirements of this essential innate interaction that is conserved across primate species.","[Saunders, Philippa M.; Widjaja, Jacqueline M.

They utilize a pair of perpendicularly oriented indirect flight muscles that contain fibrillar, stretch-activated myofibres. In contrast, all other, more slowly contracting, insect body muscles have a tubular muscle morphology(4). Here we identify the transcription factor Spalt major (Salm) as a master regulator of fibrillar flight muscle fate in Drosophila. salm is necessary and sufficient to induce fibrillar muscle fate. salm switches the entire transcriptional program from tubular to fibrillar fate by regulating the expression and splicing of key sarcomeric components specific to each muscle type. Spalt function is conserved in insects evolutionarily separated by 280 million years. We propose that Spalt proteins switch myofibres from tubular to fibrillar fate during development, a function potentially conserved in the vertebrate heart-a stretch-activated muscle sharing features with insect flight muscle.","[Schoenbauer, Cornelia; Schnorrer, Frank] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Distler, Jutta; Frasch, Manfred] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Biol, Dev Biol Div, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Jaehrling, Nina; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich] Vienna Univ Technol, FKE, Dept Bioelect, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Jaehrling, Nina; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Radolf, Martin] IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Schnorrer, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",schnorrer@biochem.mpg.de,"Frasch, Manfred/H-7002-2013","Frasch, Manfred/0000-0003-1373-9798",Max-Planck-Society; Human Frontier Science Programme; Austrian Academy of Sciences; DFG,"We thank M.

Plant-derived irritants have predominated in this regard, but animal venoms have also evolved to avert predators by targeting neurons and receptors whose activation produces noxious sensations(2-6). As such, venoms provide a rich and varied source of small molecule and protein pharmacophores(7,8) that can be exploited to characterize and manipulate key components of the pain-signalling pathway. With this in mind, here we perform an unbiased in vitro screen to identify snake venoms capable of activating somatosensory neurons. Venom from the Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener tener), whose bite produces intense and unremitting pain(9), excites a large cohort of sensory neurons. The purified active species (MitTx) consists of a heteromeric complex between Kunitz- and phospholipase-A2-like proteins that together function as a potent, persistent and selective agonist for acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), showing equal or greater efficacy compared with acidic pH. MitTx is highly selective for the ASIC1 subtype at neutral pH; under more acidic conditions (pH < 6.5), MitTx massively potenti ates (>100-fold) proton-evoked activation of ASIC2a channels. These observations raise the possibility that ASIC channels function as coincidence detectors for extracellular protons and other, as yet unidentified, endogenous factors. Purified MitTx elicits robust pain-related behaviour in mice by activation of ASIC1 channels on capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibres. These findings reveal a mechanism whereby snake venoms produce pain, and highlight an unexpected contribution of ASIC1 channels to nociception.","[Bohlen, Christopher J.; Chesler, Alexander T.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sharif-Naeini, Reza; Basbaum, Allan I.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Medzihradszky, Katalin F.; Burlingame, Alma L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Zhou, Sharleen; King, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mass Spectrometry Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.] Texas A&M Univ, Natl Nat Toxins Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",david.julius@ucsf.edu,,,"Ruth Kirschstein NIH [F31NS065597]; NIH from the UCSF Cardiovascular Research Institute; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH [NCRR P41RR001614, NCRR P40RR018300-09, NINDS R01NS065071]","We thank M.

In plants, an unanticipated decline in oxygen availability (hypoxia), as caused by roots becoming waterlogged or foliage submergence, triggers changes in gene transcription and messenger RNA translation that promote anaerobic metabolism and thus sustain substrate-level ATP production(1). In contrast to animals(2), oxygen sensing has not been ascribed to a mechanism of gene regulation in response to oxygen deprivation in plants. Here we show that the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis acts as a homeostatic sensor of severe low oxygen levels in Arabidopsis, through its regulation of key hypoxia-response transcription factors. We found that plants lacking components of the N-end rule pathway constitutively express core hypoxia-response genes and are more tolerant of hypoxic stress. We identify the hypoxia-associated ethylene response factor group VII transcription factors of Arabidopsis as substrates of this pathway. Regulation of these proteins by the N-end rule pathway occurs through a characteristic conserved motif at the amino terminus initiating with Met-Cys. Enhanced stability of one of these proteins, HRE2, under low oxygen conditions improves hypoxia survival and reveals a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing in plants via the evolutionarily conserved N-end rule pathway. SUB1A-1, a major determinant of submergence tolerance in rice(3), was shown not to be a substrate for the N-end rule pathway despite containing the N-terminal motif, indicating that it is uncoupled from N-end rule pathway regulation, and that enhanced stability may relate to the superior tolerance of Sub1 rice varieties to multiple abiotic stresses(4).","[Gibbs, Daniel J.; Isa, Nurulhikma Md; Gramuglia, Silvia; Bassel, George W.; Correia, Cristina Sousa; Holdsworth, Michael J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Plant & Crop Sci, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England; [Gibbs, Daniel J.; Isa, Nurulhikma Md; Gramuglia, Silvia; Bassel, George W.; Correia, Cristina Sousa; Holdsworth, Michael J.] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Plant Integrat Biol, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England; [Lee, Seung Cho; Fukao, Takeshi; Bailey-Serres, Julia] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Lee, Seung Cho; Fukao, Takeshi; Bailey-Serres, Julia] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Corbineau, Francoise] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UPMC, EAC 7180 UR5, F-75005 Paris, France; [Theodoulou, Frederica L.] Rothamsted Res, Dept Biol Chem, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","Holdsworth, MJ (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Plant & Crop Sci, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England.",serres@ucr.edu; michael.holdsworth@nottingham.ac.uk,"Fukao, Takeshi/H-6548-2016","Fukao, Takeshi/0000-0002-9930-1318; Holdsworth, Michael/0000-0002-3954-9215; Gibbs, Daniel/0000-0002-4100-6682; Bailey-Serres, Julia/0000-0002-8568-7125; Bassel, George/0000-0002-3434-4499",BBSRC [BB/G010595/1]; Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship; Malaysian government;  [NSF IOS-0750811];  [NIFA 2008-35100-04528],"M.J.H., D.J.G., S.

When the supply of oxygen is compromised, a variety of acclimation responses are activated to reduce the detrimental effects of energy depletion(2-4). Various oxygen-sensing mechanisms have been described that are thought to trigger these responses(5-9), but they each seem to be kingdom specific and no sensing mechanism has been identified in plants until now. Here we show that one branch of the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway for protein degradation, which is active in both mammals and plants(10,11), functions as an oxygen-sensing mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified a conserved amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the ethylene response factor (ERF)-transcription factor RAP2.12 to be dedicated to an oxygen-dependent sequence of post-translational modifications, which ultimately lead to degradation of RAP2.12 under aerobic conditions. When the oxygen concentration is low-as during flooding-RAP2.12 is released from the plasma membrane and accumulates in the nucleus to activate gene expression for hypoxia acclimation.

RIG-I is activated by blunt-ended double-stranded (ds)RNA with or without a 5'-triphosphate (ppp), by single-stranded RNA marked by a 5'-ppp(1) and by polyuridine sequences(2,3). Upon binding to such PAMP motifs, RIG-I initiates a signalling cascade that induces innate immune defences and inflammatory cytokines to establish an antiviral state. The RIG-I pathway is highly regulated and aberrant signalling leads to apoptosis, altered cell differentiation, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and cancer(4,5). The helicase and repressor domains (RD) of RIG-I recognize dsRNA and 5'-ppp RNA to activate the two amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) for signalling. Here, to understand the synergy between the helicase and the RD for RNA binding, and the contribution of ATP hydrolysis to RIG-I activation, we determined the structure of human RIG-I helicase-RD in complex with dsRNA and an ATP analogue. The helicase-RD organizes into a ring around dsRNA, capping one end, while contacting both strands using previously uncharacterized motifs to recognize dsRNA. Small-angle X-ray scattering, limited proteolysis and differential scanning fluorimetry indicate that RIG-I is in an extended and flexible conformation that compacts upon binding RNA. These results provide a detailed view of the role of helicase in dsRNA recognition, the synergy between the RD and the helicase for RNA binding and the organization of full-length RIG-I bound to dsRNA, and provide evidence of a conformational change upon RNA binding. The RIG-I helicase-RD structure is consistent with dsRNA translocation without unwinding and cooperative binding to RNA. The structure yields unprecedented insight into innate immunity and has a broader impact on other areas of biology, including RNA interference and DNA repair, which utilize homologous helicase domains within DICER and FANCM.","[Jiang, Fuguo; Miller, Matthew T.; Marcotrigiano, Joseph] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Ramanathan, Anand; Tang, Guo-Qing; Patel, Smita S.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Gale, Michael, Jr.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Marcotrigiano, J (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, 679 Hoes Lane W, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",patelss@umdnj.edu; jmarco@cabm.rutgers.edu,"JIANG, FUGUO/G-6581-2012; Marcotrigiano, Joseph /K-6697-2016","JIANG, FUGUO/0000-0003-4469-1803; Marcotrigiano, Joseph /0000-0003-0346-3353; Gale, Michael/0000-0002-6332-7436","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886, DE-AC02-06CH11357]; NSF; NIH/NIGMS through NSF [DMR-0936384]; NIH/NCRR [RR-01646]; NIH [GM55310, AI080659]","We acknowledge access to beamlines X29 at the NSLS (National Synchrotron Light Source), LRL-CAT at APS (Advanced Photon Source), and G1 and F1 at CHESS (Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source) and thank the NSLS, APS and CHESS staff.

Phytochromes form a major family of photoreceptors responsible for red light perception in plants, fungi and bacteria(1). They undergo reversible photoconversion between red-absorbing (Pr) and far-red-absorbing (Pfr) states, thereby ultimately converting a light signal into a distinct biological signal that mediates subsequent cellular responses(2). Several structures of microbial phytochromes have been determined in their dark-adapted Pr or Pfr states(3-7). However, the structural nature of initial photochemical events has not been characterized by crystallography. Here we report the crystal structures of three intermediates in the photoreaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP). We used cryotrapping crystallography to capture intermediates, and followed structural changes by scanning the temperature at which the photoreaction proceeded. Light-induced conformational changes in PaBphP originate in ring D of the biliverdin (BV) chromophore, and E-to-Z isomerization about the C-15 = C-16 double bond between rings C and D is the initial photochemical event. As the chromophore relaxes, the twist of the C-15 methine bridge about its two dihedral angles is reversed. Structural changes extend further to rings B and A, and to the surrounding protein regions. These data indicate that absorption of a photon by the Pfr state of PaBphP converts a light signal into a structural signal via twisting and untwisting of the methine bridges in the linear tetrapyrrole within the confined protein cavity.","[Yang, Xiaojing; Kuk, Jane; Moffat, Keith] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ren, Zhong; Moffat, Keith] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Moffat, Keith] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Yang, XJ (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 929 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",xiaojingyang@uchicago.edu; moffat@cars.uchicago.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM036452, RR07707]","We thank A.

Electron microscopy and biochemical analysis showed that ATP and RuBP must bind to convert CbbX into functionally active, hexameric rings. The CbbX ATPase is strongly stimulated by RuBP and Rubisco. Mutational analysis suggests that CbbX functions by transiently pulling the carboxy-terminal peptide of the Rubisco large subunit into the hexamer pore, resulting in the release of the inhibitory RuBP.

Most of the DIBs currently known are at visible and very near-infrared wavelengths, with only two previously known at wavelengths beyond one micrometre (10,000 angstroms), the longer of which is at 1.318 micrometres (ref. 6). Here we report 13 diffuse interstellar bands in the 1.5-1.8 micrometre interval on high-extinction sightlines towards stars in the Galactic Centre.

For the past 15 years, colloidal nanocrystals have been used as a model system to study this phenomenon(5,6). The occurrence of OFF periods in nanocrystal emission has been commonly attributed to the presence of an additional charge(7), which leads to photoluminescence quenching by non-radiative recombination (the Auger mechanism)(8). However, this 'charging' model was recently challenged in several reports(9,10). Here we report time-resolved photoluminescence studies of individual nanocrystal quantum dots performed while electrochemically controlling the degree of their charging, with the goal of clarifying the role of charging in blinking. We find that two distinct types of blinking are possible: conventional (A-type) blinking due to charging and discharging of the nanocrystal core, in which lower photoluminescence intensities correlate with shorter photoluminescence lifetimes; and a second sort (B-type), in which large changes in the emission intensity are not accompanied by significant changes in emission dynamics. We attribute B-type blinking to charge fluctuations in the electron-accepting surface sites. When unoccupied, these sites intercept 'hot' electrons before they relax into emitting core states. Both blinking mechanisms can be electrochemically controlled and completely suppressed by application of an appropriate potential.","[Galland, Christophe; Sykora, Milan; Klimov, Victor I.; Htoon, Han] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Chem, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Galland, Christophe; Klimov, Victor I.; Htoon, Han] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Adv Solar Photophys, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Ghosh, Yagnaseni; Steinbrueck, Andrea; Hollingsworth, Jennifer A.; Htoon, Han] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Integrated Nanotechnol, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Klimov, VI (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Chem, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",sykoram@lanl.gov; klimov@lanl.gov; htoon@lanl.gov,"Galland, Christophe/A-1075-2013","Galland, Christophe/0000-0001-5627-0796; Klimov, Victor/0000-0003-1158-3179; Htoon, Han/0000-0003-3696-2896","Center for Advanced Solar Photophysics, an Energy Frontier Research Center; US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES); Los Alamos National Laboratory; NIH-NIGMS [1R01GM084702-01]","C.G. and V.

Nature's motor proteins(1,2) have mastered the art of converting conformational changes into directed motion, and have inspired the design of artificial systems(3) such as DNA walkers(4,5) and light-and redox-driven molecular motors(6-11). But although controlled movement of single molecules along a surface has been reported(12-16), the molecules in these examples act as passive elements that either diffuse along a preferential direction with equal probability for forward and backward movement or are dragged by an STM tip. Here we present a molecule with four functional units-our previously reported rotary motors(6,8,17)-that undergo continuous and defined conformational changes upon sequential electronic and vibrational excitation. Scanning tunnelling microscopy confirms that activation of the conformational changes of the rotors through inelastic electron tunnelling propels the molecule unidirectionally across a Cu(111) surface. The system can be adapted to follow either linear or random surface trajectories or to remain stationary, by tuning the chirality of the individual motor units.

Models of conventional dynamos driven by thermal or compositional convection have had difficulty reproducing the existence and apparently long duration of the lunar dynamo(5-7). Here we investigate an alternative mechanism of dynamo generation: continuous mechanical stirring arising from the differential motion, due to Earth-driven precession of the lunar spin axis, between the solid silicate mantle and the liquid core beneath(8,9). We show that the fluid motions and the power required to drive a dynamo operating continuously for more than one billion years and generating a magnetic field that had an intensity of more than one microtesla 4.2 billion years ago(3) are readily obtained by mechanical stirring. The magnetic field is predicted to decrease with time and to shut off naturally when the Moon recedes far enough from Earth that the dissipated power is insufficient to drive a dynamo; in our nominal model, this occurred at about 48 Earth radii (2.7 billion years ago). Thus, lunar palaeomagnetic measurements may be able to constrain the poorly known early orbital evolution of the Moon. This mechanism may also be applicable to dynamos in other bodies, such as large asteroids.","[Dwyer, C.

A commonly invoked hypothesis is that the Moon might once have possessed a thermally driven core dynamo(3), but this theory is problematical given the small size of the core and the required surface magnetic field strengths(6). An alternative hypothesis is that impact events might have amplified ambient fields near the antipodes of the largest basins(7), but many magnetic anomalies exist that are not associated with basin antipodes. Here we propose a new model for magnetic field generation, in which dynamo action comes from impact-induced changes in the Moon's rotation rate. Basin-forming impact events are energetic enough to have unlocked the Moon from synchronous rotation(8), and we demonstrate that the subsequent large-scale fluid flows in the core, excited by the tidal distortion of the core-mantle boundary(9), could have powered a lunar dynamo. Predicted surface magnetic field strengths are on the order of several microteslas, consistent with palaeomagnetic measurements(5), and the duration of these fields is sufficient to explain the central magnetic anomalies associated with several large impact basins.","[Le Bars, M.; Cebron, D.] CNRS, IRPHE, F-13384 Marseille 13, France; [Le Bars, M.; Cebron, D.] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13384 Marseille 13, France; [Wieczorek, M.

This is partly because social behaviours do not fossilize, making it difficult to infer changes over evolutionary time. However, primate social behaviour shows strong evidence for phylogenetic inertia, permitting the use of Bayesian comparative methods to infer changes in social behaviour through time, thereby allowing us to evaluate alternative models of social evolution. Here we present a model of primate social evolution, whereby sociality progresses from solitary foraging individuals directly to large multi-male/multi-female aggregations (approximately 52 million years (Myr) ago), with pair-living (approximately 16 Myr ago) or single-male harem systems (approximately 16 Myr ago) derivative from this second stage. This model fits the data significantly better than the two widely accepted alternatives (an unstructured model implied by the socioecological hypothesis or a model that allows linear stepwise changes in social complexity through time). We also find strong support for the co-evolution of social living with a change from nocturnal to diurnal activity patterns, but not with sex-biased dispersal. This supports suggestions that social living may arise because of increased predation risk associated with diurnal activity. Sociality based on loose aggregation is followed by a second shift to stable or bonded groups. This structuring facilitates the evolution of cooperative behaviours(5) and may provide the scaffold for other distinctive anthropoid traits including coalition formation, cooperative resource defence and large brains.","[Shultz, Susanne; Opie, Christopher; Atkinson, Quentin D.] Univ Oxford, Inst Cognit & Evolutionary Anthropol, Oxford OX2 6PN, England; [Atkinson, Quentin D.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland, New Zealand","Shultz, S (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Inst Cognit & Evolutionary Anthropol, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",susanne.shultz@anthro.ox.ac.uk,"Shultz, Susanne/C-3162-2012","Shultz, Susanne/0000-0002-7135-4880; Atkinson, Quentin/0000-0002-8499-7535",Royal Society,S.S. is supported by a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship.

Although it is the size of a mouse, its maximum lifespan exceeds 30 years, making this animal the longest-living rodent. Naked mole rats show negligible senescence, no age-related increase in mortality, and high fecundity until death(2). In addition to delayed ageing, they are resistant to both spontaneous cancer and experimentally induced tumorigenesis(3,4). Naked mole rats pose a challenge to the theories that link ageing, cancer and redox homeostasis. Although characterized by significant oxidative stress(5), the naked mole rat proteome does not show age-related susceptibility to oxidative damage or increased ubiquitination(6). Naked mole rats naturally reside in large colonies with a single breeding female, the 'queen', who suppresses the sexual maturity of her subordinates(7). They also live in full darkness, at low oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations(8), and are unable to sustain thermogenesis(9) nor feel certain types of pain(10,11). Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the naked mole rat genome, which reveals unique genome features and molecular adaptations consistent with cancer resistance, poikilothermy, hairlessness and insensitivity to low oxygen, and altered visual function, circadian rythms and taste sensing. This information provides insights into the naked mole rat's exceptional longevity and ability to live in hostile conditions, in the dark and at low oxygen. The extreme traits of the naked mole rat, together with the reported genome and transcriptome information, offer opportunities for understanding ageing and advancing other areas of biological and biomedical research.","[Fang, Xiaodong; Huang, Zhiyong; Han, Lijuan; Sun, Xiaoqing; Yang, Pengcheng; Zhao, Xiang; Peng, Chunfang; Xiong, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Yabing; Chen, Yuanxin; Zhang, Qiang; Yang, Lan; Wang, Bo; Han, Changlei; Li, Qiye; Chen, Li; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Guojie; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Kim, Eun Bae; Fushan, Alexey A.; Gladyshev, Vadim N.] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Bioinspired Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Lobanov, Alexei V.; Marino, Stefano M.; Turanov, Anton A.; Yim, Sun Hee; Kasaikina, Marina V.; Stoletzki, Nina; Polak, Paz; Kiezun, Adam; Kryukov, Gregory V.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.; Gladyshev, Vadim N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kryukov, Gregory V.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.; Gladyshev, Vadim N.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Peshkin, Leonid] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bronson, Roderick T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Rodent Histopathol Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Buffenstein, Rochelle] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Physiol, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; [Buffenstein, Rochelle] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Sam & Ann Barshop Inst Longev & Aging Studies, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; [Park, Thomas J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark","Zhang, GJ (reprint author), BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China.",zhanggj@genomics.org.cn; wangj@genomics.org.cn; vgladyshev@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Kryukov, Gregory/A-9592-2008; Gladyshev, Vadim/A-9894-2013; Zhang, Guojie/B-6188-2014; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Yang, Pengcheng/N-1037-2014; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016; Li, Qiye/C-1348-2015","Zhang, Guojie/0000-0001-6860-1521; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Yang, Pengcheng/0000-0001-5496-8357; Stoletzki, Nina/0000-0002-4648-3103; Kryukov, Gregory/0000-0002-6131-9483; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Li, Qiye/0000-0002-5993-0312","WCU [R31-2008-000-10010-0]; NIH [AG038004, AG021518, CA080946]; Shenzhen Municipal Government [ZYC200903240077A]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30725008]; National Science Foundation [0744979]","We thank P.

It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses.","[O'Doherty, Joseph E.; Ifft, Peter J.; Zhuang, Katie Z.; Nicolelis, Miguel A.

Cellular senescence, which halts the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is an important mechanism to constrain the malignant progression of tumour cells(1,2). Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs with ageing(3) and have been hypothesized to disrupt tissue structure and function because of the components they secrete(4,5). However, whether senescent cells are causally implicated in age-related dysfunction and whether their removal is beneficial has remained unknown. To address these fundamental questions, we made use of a biomarker for senescence, p16(Ink4a), to design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC, for inducible elimination of p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Here we show that in the BubR1 progeroid mouse background, INK-ATTAC removes p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon drug treatment. In tissues-such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and eye-in which p16(Ink4a) contributes to the acquisition of age-related pathologies, life-long removal of p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells delayed onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated progression of already established age-related disorders. These data indicate that cellular senescence is causally implicated in generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend healthspan.","[Baker, Darren J.; Wijshake, Tobias; Childs, Bennett G.; van Deursen, Jan M.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Pediat & Adolescent Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Baker, Darren J.; Tchkonia, Tamar; LeBrasseur, Nathan K.; Kirkland, James L.; van Deursen, Jan M.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Robert & Arlene Kogod Ctr Aging, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Wijshake, Tobias; van de Sluis, Bart] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Pathol & Med Biol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands","van Deursen, JM (reprint author), Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Pediat & Adolescent Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",vandeursen.jan@mayo.edu,"Kirkland, James/F-9159-2016","Wijshake, Tobias/0000-0003-1784-2100; LeBrasseur, Nathan/0000-0002-2002-0418","Ellison Medical Foundation; Noaber Foundation; Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging; National Institutes of Health [CA96985, AG13925]","We thank W.

Because every chromosome must receive a minimum number of DSBs, attention has focused on factors that support DSB formation(2). However, improperly repaired DSBs can cause meiotic arrest or mutation(3,4); thus, having too many DSBs is probably as deleterious as having too few. Only a small fraction of SPO11 protein ever makes a DSB in yeast or mouse(5) and SPO11 and its accessory factors remain abundant long after most DSB formation ceases(1), implying the existence of mechanisms that restrain SPO11 activity to limit DSB numbers. Here we report that the number of meiotic DSBs in mouse is controlled by ATM, a kinase activated by DNA damage to trigger checkpoint signalling and promote DSB repair. Levels of SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes, by-products of meiotic DSB formation, are elevated at least tenfold in spermatocytes lacking ATM. Moreover, Atm mutation renders SPO11-oligonucleotide levels sensitive to genetic manipulations that modulate SPO11 protein levels. We propose that ATM restrains SPO11 via a negative feedback loop in which kinase activation by DSBs suppresses further DSB formation. Our findings explain previously puzzling phenotypes of Atm-null mice and provide a molecular basis for the gonadal dysgenesis observed in ataxia telangiectasia, the human syndrome caused by ATM deficiency.","[Lange, Julian; Pan, Jing; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cole, Francesca; Jasin, Maria] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Thelen, Michael P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Keeney, S (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",m-jasin@ski.mskcc.org; s-keeney@ski.mskcc.org,"Thelen, Michael/C-6834-2008; Thelen, Michael/G-2032-2014","Thelen, Michael/0000-0002-2479-5480; Thelen, Michael/0000-0002-2479-5480; Keeney, Scott/0000-0002-1283-6417","NIH [HD040916, HD053855, GM058673]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Ruth L.

Key components of this reaction are exonuclease 1 and the bifunctional endo/exonuclease, Mre11 (refs 2-4). Mre11 endonuclease activity is critical when DSB termini are blocked by bound protein-such as by the DNA end-joining complex(5), topoisomerases(6) or the meiotic transesterase Spo11 (refs 7-13)-but a specific function for the Mre11 3'-5' exonuclease activity has remained elusive. Here we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal a role for the Mre11 exonuclease during the resection of Spo11-linked 5'-DNA termini in vivo. We show that the residual resection observed in Exo1-mutant cells is dependent on Mre11, and that both exonuclease activities are required for efficient DSB repair. Previous work has indicated that resection traverses unidirectionally(1). Using a combination of physical assays for 5'-end processing, our results indicate an alternative mechanism involving bidirectional resection. First, Mre11 nicks the strand to be resected up to 300 nucleotides from the 5'-terminus of the DSB-much further away than previously assumed. Second, this nick enables resection in a bidirectional manner, using Exo1 in the 5'-3' direction away from the DSB, and Mre11 in the 3'-5' direction towards the DSB end. Mre11 exonuclease activity also confers resistance to DNA damage in cycling cells, suggesting that Mre11-catalysed resection may be a general feature of various DNA repair pathways.","[Garcia, Valerie; Phelps, Sarah E.

Besides a critical role in accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, recombination functions in DNA repair and in the recovery of stalled or broken replication forks to ensure genomic stability. In contrast, inappropriate recombination contributes to genomic instability, leading to loss of heterozygosity, chromosome rearrangements and cell death. The RecA/UvsX/RadA/Rad51 family of proteins catalyses the signature reactions of recombination, homology search and DNA strand invasion(1,2). Eukaryotes also possess Rad51 paralogues, whose exact role in recombination remains to be defined(3). Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 paralogues, the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer, counteract the antirecombination activity of the Srs2 helicase. The Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer associates with the Rad51-single-stranded DNA filament, rendering it more stable than a nucleoprotein filament containing Rad51 alone. The Rad51-Rad55-Rad57 co-filament resists disruption by the Srs2 antirecombinase by blocking Srs2 translocation, involving a direct protein interaction between Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role of the Rad51 paralogues in stabilizing the Rad51 filament against a biologically important antagonist, the Srs2 antirecombination helicase. The biological significance of this mechanism is indicated by a complete suppression of the ionizing radiation sensitivity of rad55 or rad57 mutants by concomitant deletion of SRS2, as expected for biological antagonists. We propose that the Rad51 presynaptic filament is a meta-stable reversible intermediate, whose assembly and disassembly is governed by the balance between Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2, providing a key regulatory mechanism controlling the initiation of homologous recombination. These data provide a paradigm for the potential function of the human RAD51 paralogues, which are known to be involved in cancer predisposition and human disease.","[Liu, Jie; Heyer, Wolf-Dietrich] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Renault, Ludovic; Stahlberg, Henning; Heyer, Wolf-Dietrich] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Veaute, Xavier; Fabre, Francis] CEA, CNRS, UMR217, CEA DSV Inst Radiobiol Cellulaire & Mol, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Stahlberg, Henning] Univ Basel, Ctr Cellular Imaging & Nanoanalyt, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Heyer, WD (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",wdheyer@ucdavis.edu,"Stahlberg, Henning/H-1868-2011","Stahlberg, Henning/0000-0002-1185-4592; Renault, Ludovic/0000-0001-6464-8808","Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program [17FT-0046]; European Community [LSHG-CT-2003-503303]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique; SystemsX.ch; National Institutes of Health [U54GM74929, CA92267, GM58015]","We thank M.

Those hydrogenases maintaining their activity in the presence of O-2 are considered to be central to H-2-based technologies, such as enzymatic fuel cells and for light-driven H-2 production(2). Despite comprehensive genetic, biochemical, electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations(3-8), the molecular background allowing a structural interpretation of how the catalytic centre is protected from irreversible inactivation by O-2 has remained unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of an O-2-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase from the aerobic H-2 oxidizer Ralstonia eutropha H16 at 1.5 angstrom resolution. The heterodimeric enzyme consists of a large subunit harbouring the catalytic centre in the H-2-reduced state and a small subunit containing an electron relay consisting of three different iron-sulphur clusters. The cluster proximal to the active site displays an unprecedented [4Fe-3S] structure and is coordinated by six cysteines. According to the current model, this cofactor operates as an electronic switch depending on the nature of the gas molecule approaching the active site. It serves as an electron acceptor in the course of H-2 oxidation and as an electron-delivering device upon O-2 attack at the active site. This dual function is supported by the capability of the novel iron-sulphur cluster to adopt three redox states at physiological redox potentials(7-9). The second structural feature is a network of extended water cavities that may act as a channel facilitating the removal of water produced at the [NiFe] active site. These discoveries will have an impact on the design of biological and chemical H-2-converting catalysts that are capable of cycling H-2 in air.","[Scheerer, Patrick; Kroschinsky, Sebastian; Spahn, Christian M.

In contrast to the well-studied O-2-sensitive [NiFe]-hydrogenases (referred to as the standard enzymes), MBH has an O-2-tolerant H-2 oxidation activity(2-4); however, the mechanism of O-2 tolerance is unclear(5). Here we report the crystal structures of Hydrogenovibrio marinus MBH in three different redox conditions at resolutions between 1.18 and 1.32 angstrom. We find that the proximal iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster of MBH has a [4Fe-3S] structure coordinated by six cysteine residues-in contrast to the [4Fe-4S] cubane structure coordinated by four cysteine residues found in the proximal Fe-S cluster of the standard enzymes-and that an amide nitrogen of the polypeptide backbone is deprotonated and additionally coordinates the cluster when chemically oxidized, thus stabilizing the superoxidized state of the cluster. The structure of MBH is very similar to that of the O-2-sensitive standard enzymes except for the proximal Fe-S cluster. Our results give a reasonable explanation why the O-2 tolerance of MBH is attributable to the unique proximal Fe-S cluster; we propose that the cluster is not only a component of the electron transfer for the catalytic cycle, but that it also donates two electrons and one proton crucial for the appropriate reduction of O-2 in preventing the formation of an unready, inactive state of the enzyme.","[Shomura, Yasuhito; Higuchi, Yoshiki] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Life Sci, Kamigori, Hyogo 6781297, Japan; [Shomura, Yasuhito; Higuchi, Yoshiki] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Yoon, Ki-Seok; Nishihara, Hirofumi] Ibaraki Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Bioresource Sci, Ami, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan; [Higuchi, Yoshiki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Higuchi, Y (reprint author), Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Life Sci, 3-2-1 Koto, Kamigori, Hyogo 6781297, Japan.",hig@sci.u-hyogo.ac.jp,,,"Academia Sinica; National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (Taiwan); MEXT [20051022, 22770111, 18GS0207]; JSPS [20580094, 22370061, 22657031]; University of Hyogo; Hyogo Science and Technology Association; GCOE Program; Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency Project; JST, Japan","We thank K.

We observe a medio-lateral spatial segregation between extensor and flexor premotor interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord. These premotor interneuron populations are derived from common progenitor domains, but segregate by timing of neurogenesis. We find that proprioceptive sensory feedback from the periphery is targeted to medial extensor premotor populations and is required for extensor-specific connectivity profiles during development.

In contrast, it is thought that the PLR in mammals generally requires neuronal circuitry connecting the eye and the brain. Here we report that an intrinsic component of the PLR is in fact widespread in nocturnal and crepuscular mammals. In mouse, this intrinsic PLR requires the visual pigment melanopsin; it also requires PLC beta 4, a vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila NorpA phospholipase C which mediates rhabdomeric phototransduction. The Plcb4(-/-) genotype, in addition to removing the intrinsic PLR, also essentially eliminates the intrinsic light response of the M1 subtype of melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (M1-ipRGCs), which are by far the most photosensitive ipRGC subtype and also have the largest response to light. Ablating in mouse the expression of both TRPC6 and TRPC7, members of the TRP channel superfamily, also essentially eliminated the M1-ipRGC light response but the intrinsic PLR was not affected. Thus, melanopsin signalling exists in both iris and retina, involving a PLC beta 4-mediated pathway that nonetheless diverges in the two locations.","[Xue, T.; Do, M. T.

Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for developmental regulation of splicing outcome through heritable epigenetic marks.","[Shukla, Sanjeev; Gregory, Melissa; Shutinoski, Bojan; Oberdoerffer, Philipp; Oberdoerffer, Shalini] Natl Canc Inst Frederick, Ctr Canc Res, Mouse Canc Genet Program, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Kavak, Ersen; Sandberg, Rickard] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kavak, Ersen; Sandberg, Rickard] Ludwig Inst Canc Res, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Imashimizu, Masahiko; Kashlev, Mikhail] Natl Canc Inst Frederick, Ctr Canc Res, Gene Regulat & Chromosome Biol Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Oberdoerffer, S (reprint author), Natl Canc Inst Frederick, Ctr Canc Res, Mouse Canc Genet Program, Frederick, MD 21702 USA.",shalini.oberdoerffer@nih.gov,"Shutinoski, Bojan/M-5260-2016","Shutinoski, Bojan/0000-0003-4669-5656; Sandberg, Rickard/0000-0001-6473-1740","NIH, the National Cancer Institute, The Center for Cancer Research; Swedish Research Council Foundation; Foundation for Strategic Research","We thank A.

Some features have been identified as the stretching and bending modes of aromatic compounds(2,3), and are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules(4,5). The central argument supporting this attribution is that single-photon excitation of the molecule can account for the unidentified infrared emission features observed in 'cirrus' clouds in the diffuse interstellar medium(6). Of the more than 160 molecules identified in the circumstellar and interstellar environments, however, not one is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule. The detections of discrete and broad aliphatic spectral features suggest that the carrier of the unidentified infrared emission features cannot be a pure aromatic compound. Here we report an analysis of archival spectroscopic observations and demonstrate that the data are most consistent with the carriers being amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure. This structure is similar to that of the organic materials found in meteorites, as would be expected if the Solar System had inherited these organic materials from interstellar sources.","[Kwok, Sun; Zhang, Yong] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Kwok, S (reprint author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",sunkwok@hku.hk,,"Kwok, Sun/0000-0001-7708-081X","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [HKU 7027/11P]","We thank A.

A long-standing goal of this research has been to identify or develop robust quantum systems that can be easily manipulated, for future use in advanced information and communication technologies(2). Recently, a point defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy centre has attracted a great deal of interest because it possesses an atomic-scale electronic spin state that can be used as an individually addressable, solid-state quantum bit (qubit), even at room temperature(3). These exceptional quantum properties have motivated efforts to identify similar defects in other semiconductors, as they may offer an expanded range of functionality not available to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre(4). Notably, several defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have been suggested as good candidates for exploration, owing to a combination of computational predictions and magnetic resonance data(4-10). Here we demonstrate that several defect spin states in the 4H polytype of SiC (4H-SiC) can be optically addressed and coherently controlled in the time domain at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 kelvin. Using optical and microwave techniques similar to those used with diamond nitrogen-vacancy qubits, we study the spin-1 ground state of each of four inequivalent forms of the neutral carbon-silicon divacancy, as well as a pair of defect spin states of unidentified origin. These defects are optically active near telecommunication wavelengths(11), and are found in a host material for which there already exist industrial-scale crystal growth(12) and advanced microfabrication techniques(13). In addition, they possess desirable spin coherence properties that are comparable to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. This makes them promising candidates for various photonic, spintronic and quantum information applications that merge quantum degrees of freedom with classical electronic and optical technologies(2,14-17).","[Koehl, William F.; Buckley, Bob B.; Heremans, F.

Catalytic ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a widely used method for the synthesis of large unsaturated rings(1,2); however, cyclizations often proceed without control of alkene stereochemistry(2). This shortcoming is particularly costly when the cyclization reaction is performed after a long sequence of other chemical transformations(2). Here we outline a reliable, practical and general approach for the efficient and highly stereoselective synthesis of macrocyclic alkenes by catalytic RCM; transformations deliver up to 97% of the Z isomer owing to control induced by a tungsten-based alkylidene. Utility is demonstrated through the stereoselective preparation of epothilone C (refs 3-5) and nakadomarin A (ref. 6), the previously reported syntheses of which have been marred by late-stage, non-selective RCM(7-12). The tungsten alkylidene can be manipulated in air, delivering the products in useful yields with high stereoselectivity. As a result of efficient RCM and re-incorporation of side products into the catalytic cycle with minimal alkene isomerization, desired cyclizations proceed in preference to alternative pathways, even under relatively high substrate concentration.","[Yu, Miao; Wang, Chenbo; Hoveyda, Amir H.] Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Kyle, Andrew F.; Jakubec, Pavol; Dixon, Darren J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; [Schrock, Richard R.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Hoveyda, AH (reprint author), Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",amir.hoveyda@bc.edu,,,"United States National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-59426]; EPSRC-GlaxoSmithKline; EPSRC","This work was supported by the United States National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences (grant GM-59426 to A.

Thus a recent increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones over the northern Indian Ocean(5) is thought to be related to the weakening of the climatological vertical wind shear(3,4). At the same time, anthropogenic emissions of aerosols have increased sixfold since the 1930s, leading to a weakening of the southwesterly lower-level and easterly upper-level winds that define the monsoonal circulation over the Arabian Sea(6-9). In principle, this aerosol-driven circulation modification could affect tropical cyclone intensity over the Arabian Sea, but so far no such linkage has been shown. Here we report an increase in the intensity of pre-monsoon Arabian Sea tropical cyclones during the period 1979-2010, and show that this change in storm strength is a consequence of a simultaneous upward trend in anthropogenic black carbon and sulphate emissions. We use a combination of observational, reanalysis and model data to demonstrate that the anomalous circulation, which is radiatively forced by these anthropogenic aerosols, reduces the basin-wide vertical wind shear, creating an environment more favourable for tropical cyclone intensification. Because most Arabian Sea tropical cyclones make landfall(1), our results suggest an additional impact on human health from regional air pollution.","[Evan, Amato T.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Kossin, James P.] NOAA, Natl Climat Data Ctr, Asheville, NC 28801 USA; [Kossin, James P.] NOAA, Cooperat Inst Meteorol Satellite Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chung, Chul 'Eddy'] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Kwangju 500712, South Korea; [Ramanathan, V.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Evan, AT (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",ate9c@virginia.edu,"Kossin, James/C-2022-2016","Kossin, James/0000-0003-0461-9794",National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Climate Program Office [NA10OAR4310136]; Korea's Research Agency for Climate Science [RACS 2010-2603]; National Science Foundation [ATM-0721142],"Partial funding for this work was provided by National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Climate Program Office (NA10OAR4310136), Korea's Research Agency for Climate Science (RACS 2010-2603) and the National Science Foundation (ATM-0721142).

Dryolestoids are known by teeth and jaws from the Jurassic period of North America and Europe(2,3), but they thrived in South America up to the end of the Mesozoic era and survived to the beginnings of the Cenozoic(2,4-7). Isolated teeth and jaws from the latest Cretaceous of South America provide mounting evidence that, at least in western Gondwana, dryolestoids developed into strongly endemic groups by the Late Cretaceous(4-9). However, the lack of pre-Late Cretaceous dryolestoid remains made study of their origin and early diversification intractable. Here we describe the first mammalian remains from the early Late Cretaceous of South America, including two partial skulls and jaws of a derived dryolestoid showing dental and cranial features unknown among any other group of Mesozoic mammals, such as single-rooted molars preceded by double-rooted premolars, combined with a very long muzzle, exceedingly long canines and evidence of highly specialized masticatory musculature. On one hand, the new mammal shares derived features of dryolestoids(1-3) with forms from the Jurassic of Laurasia, whereas on the other hand, it is very specialized and highlights the endemic, diverse dryolestoid fauna from the Cretaceous of South America. Our specimens include only the second mammalian skull known for the Cretaceous of Gondwana, bridging a previous 60-million-year gap in the fossil record, and document the whole cranial morphology of a dryolestoid, revealing an unsuspected morphological and ecological diversity for non-tribosphenic mammals.","[Rougier, Guillermo W.] Univ Louisville, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, Louisville, KY 40202 USA; [Apesteguia, Sebastian] Univ Maimonides, CEBBAD Fdn Hist Nat Felix de Azara, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Apesteguia, Sebastian; Gaetano, Leandro C.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Gaetano, Leandro C.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Cs Geol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Rougier, GW (reprint author), Univ Louisville, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",grougier@louisville.edu,,,"Antorchas Foundation; American Museum of Natural History; NSF [DEB 0946430, DEB 1068089, ATOL 0629959]; Jurassic Foundation; NASA; Field Museum Womens' Board","We thank M.

Although grid cells have been characterized in detail in rats(1-6), the fundamental question of what neural dynamics give rise to the grid structure remains unresolved. Two competing classes of models were proposed: network models, based on attractor dynamics(7-9), and oscillatory interference models, which propose that interference between somatic and dendritic theta-band oscillations (4-10 Hz) in single neurons transforms a temporal oscillation into a spatially periodic grid(10-13). So far, these models could not be dissociated experimentally, because rodent grid cells always co-exist with continuous theta oscillations(4-6,14). Here we used a novel animal model, the Egyptian fruit bat(15,16), to refute the proposed causal link between grids and theta oscillations. On the basis of our previous finding from bat hippocampus, of spatially tuned place cells in the absence of continuous theta oscillations(17), we hypothesized that grid cells in bat medial entorhinal cortex might also exist without theta oscillations. Indeed, we found grid cells in bat medial entorhinal cortex that shared remarkable similarities to rodent grid cells. Notably, the grids existed in the absence of continuous theta-band oscillations, and with almost no theta modulation of grid-cell spiking-both of which are essential prerequisites of the oscillatory interference models.

This exclusive receptor gene expression restricts the sensitivity spectrum of neurons and is coordinated with the choice of their synaptic targets(1-3). However, little is known about how it is maintained throughout the life of a neuron. Here we show that the green-light sensing receptor rhodopsin 6 (Rh6) acts to exclude an alternative blue-sensitive rhodopsin 5 (Rh5) from a subset of Drosophila R8 photoreceptor neurons(4). Loss of Rh6 leads to a gradual expansion of Rh5 expression into all R8 photoreceptors of the ageing adult retina. The Rh6 feedback signal results in repression of the rh5 promoter and can be mimicked by other Drosophila rhodopsins; it is partly dependent on activation of rhodopsin by light, and relies on G(alpha q) activity, but not on the subsequent steps of the phototransduction cascade(5). Our observations reveal a thus far unappreciated spectral plasticity of R8 photoreceptors, and identify rhodopsin feedback as an exclusion mechanism.","[Vasiliauskas, Daniel; Mazzoni, Esteban O.; Sprecher, Simon G.; Brodetskiy, Konstantin; Johnston, Robert J., Jr.; Lidder, Preetmoninder; Vogt, Nina; Celik, Arzu; Desplan, Claude] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA","Desplan, C (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA.",cd38@nyu.edu,"Sprecher, Simon/B-5188-2012","mazzoni, esteban/0000-0001-8994-681X; Sprecher, Simon/0000-0001-9060-3750","National Institutes of Health [R01EY13012, F32EY016309]","We thank J.

IQ is generally considered to be stable across the lifespan, with scores at one time point used to predict educational achievement and employment prospects in later years(1). Neuroimaging allows us to test whether unexpected longitudinal fluctuations in measured IQ are related to brain development. Here we show that verbal and non-verbal IQ can rise or fall in the teenage years, with these changes in performance validated by their close correlation with changes in local brain structure. A combination of structural and functional imaging showed that verbal IQ changed with grey matter in a region that was activated by speech, whereas non-verbal IQ changed with grey matter in a region that was activated by finger movements. By using longitudinal assessments of the same individuals, we obviated the many sources of variation in brain structure that confound cross-sectional studies. This allowed us to dissociate neural markers for the two types of IQ and to show that general verbal and non-verbal abilities are closely linked to the sensorimotor skills involved in learning. More generally, our results emphasize the possibility that an individual's intellectual capacity relative to their peers can decrease or increase in the teenage years. This would be encouraging to those whose intellectual potential may improve, and would be a warning that early achievers may not maintain their potential.","[Ramsden, Sue; Richardson, Fiona M.; Josse, Goulven; Ellis, Caroline; Shakeshaft, Clare; Seghier, Mohamed L.; Price, Cathy J.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Thomas, Michael S.

Here we show, with C57BL/6 Casp11 gene-targeted mice, that caspase-11 (also known as caspase-4)(6-8) is critical for caspase-1 activation and IL-1 beta production in macrophages infected with Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium or Vibrio cholerae. Strain 129 mice, like Casp11(-/-) mice, exhibited defects in IL-1 beta production and harboured a mutation in the Casp11 locus that attenuated caspase-11 expression. This finding is important because published targeting of the Casp1 gene was done using strain 129 embryonic stem cells(9,10). Casp1 and Casp11 are too close in the genome to be segregated by recombination; consequently, the published Casp1(-/-) mice lack both caspase-11 and caspase-1. Interestingly, Casp11(-/-) macrophages secreted IL-1 beta normally in response to ATP and monosodium urate, indicating that caspase-11 is engaged by a non-canonical inflammasome. Casp1(-/-)Casp11(129mt/129mt) macrophages expressing caspase-11 from a C57BL/6 bacterial artificial chromosome transgene failed to secrete IL-1 beta regardless of stimulus, confirming an essential role for caspase-1 in IL-1 beta production. Caspase-11 rather than caspase-1, however, was required for non-canonical inflammasome-triggered macrophage cell death, indicating that caspase-11 orchestrates both caspase-1-dependent and -independent outputs. Caspase-1 activation by non-canonical stimuli required NLRP3 and ASC, but caspase-11 processing and cell death did not, implying that there is a distinct activator of caspase-11. Lastly, loss of caspase-11 rather than caspase-1 protected mice from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. These data highlight a unique pro-inflammatory role for caspase-11 in the innate immune response to clinically significant bacterial infections.","[Kayagaki, Nobuhiko; Louie, Salina; Dong, Jennifer; Newton, Kim; Qu, Yan; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Warming, Soren; Heldens, Sherry; Roose-Girma, Merone] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Lamkanfi, Mohamed; Vande Walle, Lieselotte] VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lamkanfi, Mohamed; Vande Walle, Lieselotte] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Liu, Jinfeng] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Zhang, Juan; Lee, Wyne P.] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Kayagaki, N (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",kayagaki@gene.com; dixit@gene.com,"dixit, vishva/A-4496-2012","dixit, vishva/0000-0001-6983-0326; Liu, Jinfeng/0000-0002-0343-8222",,,,35,622,628,6,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Nov,2011,479,7371,,,,,117,U146,,10.1038/nature10558,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,840FA,WOS:000296422600043,22002608,No,Y,N,11/20/17

However, it is unknown whether PHD2 can influence arteriogenesis. Here we studied the role of PHD2 in collateral artery growth by using hindlimb ischaemia as a model, a process that compensates for the lack of blood flow in case of major arterial occlusion(6-8). We show that Phd2 (also known as Egln1) haplodeficient (Phd2(+/-)) mice displayed preformed collateral arteries that preserved limb perfusion and prevented tissue necrosis in ischaemia. Improved arteriogenesis in Phd2(+/-) mice was due to an expansion of tissue-resident, M2-like macrophages(9,10) and their increased release of arteriogenic factors, leading to enhanced smooth muscle cell (SMC) recruitment and growth. Both chronic and acute deletion of one Phd2 allele in macrophages was sufficient to skew their polarization towards a pro-arteriogenic phenotype. Mechanistically, collateral vessel preconditioning relied on the activation of canonical NF-kappa B pathway in Phd2(+/-) macrophages. These results unravel how PHD2 regulates arteriogenesis and artery homeostasis by controlling a specific differentiation state in macrophages and suggest new treatment options for ischaemic disorders.","[Takeda, Yukiji; Costa, Sandra; Delamarre, Estelle; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Finisguerra, Veronica; Deschoemaeker, Sofie; Wenes, Mathias; Hamm, Alexander; Serneels, Jens; Mazzone, Massimiliano] VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Takeda, Yukiji; Costa, Sandra; Delamarre, Estelle; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Finisguerra, Veronica; Deschoemaeker, Sofie; Wenes, Mathias; Hamm, Alexander; Serneels, Jens; Mazzone, Massimiliano] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Takeda, Yukiji; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Bruyere, Francoise] VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Angiogenesis & Neurovasc Link, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Takeda, Yukiji; Roncal, Carmen; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite; Bruyere, Francoise] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Angiogenesis & Neurovasc Link, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Costa, Sandra] Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Roncal, Carmen] CIMA Univ Navarra, Atherosclerosis Res Lab, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Squadrito, Mario Leonardo; De Palma, Michele] San Raffaele Inst, Angiogenesis & Tumor Targeting Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Squadrito, Mario Leonardo; De Palma, Michele] San Raffaele Inst, HSR TIGET, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Squadrito, Mario Leonardo] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Magat, Julie; Jordan, Benedicte F.; Gallez, Bernard] Catholic Univ Louvain, Biomed Magnet Resonance Unit, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Bhattacharyya, Tapan; Maxwell, Patrick] UCL, Rayne Inst, London WC1E 6JF, England; [Anisimov, Andrey; Alitalo, Kari] Biomedicum Helsinki, Res Programs Unit, Mol Canc Biol Lab, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Anisimov, Andrey; Alitalo, Kari] Biomedicum Helsinki, Inst Mol Med, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Zhuang, Zhen W.; Simons, Michael] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Saito, Yoshihiko] Nara Med Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Nara 6348522, Japan","Mazzone, M (reprint author), VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Mol Oncol & Angiogenesis, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",massimiliano.mazzone@vib-kuleuven.be,"Maxwell, Patrick/C-5557-2008; De Palma, Michele/L-5350-2016; Alitalo, Kari/J-5013-2014; Costa, Sandra/B-4253-2011; Simons, Michael/G-8553-2014","Maxwell, Patrick/0000-0002-0338-2679; Alitalo, Kari/0000-0002-7331-0902; Leite de Oliveira, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9696-2014; Costa, Sandra/0000-0001-6795-4245; Mazzone, Massimiliano/0000-0001-8824-4015; Simons, Michael/0000-0003-0348-7734; Roncal, Carmen/0000-0003-0616-9600; Squadrito, Mario Leonardo/0000-0002-1188-0299","FWO, Belgium [G.0726.10]; VIB; ARC; FCT; FWO; DFG; COST action [TD0901]; ERC","This work was supported by grants from FWO (G.0726.10), Belgium, and from VIB.

In the Antarctic, essentially complete removal of lower-stratospheric ozone currently results in an ozone hole every year, whereas in the Arctic, ozone loss is highly variable and has until now been much more limited. Here we demonstrate that chemical ozone destruction over the Arctic in early 2011 was-for the first time in the observational record-comparable to that in the Antarctic ozone hole. Unusually long-lasting cold conditions in the Arctic lower stratosphere led to persistent enhancement in ozone-destroying forms of chlorine and to unprecedented ozone loss, which exceeded 80 per cent over 18-20 kilometres altitude. Our results show that Arctic ozone holes are possible even with temperatures much milder than those in the Antarctic. We cannot at present predict when such severe Arctic ozone depletion may be matched or exceeded.","[Manney, Gloria L.; Santee, Michelle L.; Livesey, Nathaniel J.; Froidevaux, Lucien] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Manney, Gloria L.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Rex, Markus; Wohltmann, Ingo; Lehmann, Ralph; Gernandt, Hartwig; von der Gathen, Peter] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Pitts, Michael C.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; [Veefkind, Pepijn; Levelt, Pieternel F.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; [Veefkind, Pepijn; Levelt, Pieternel F.] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Nash, Eric R.; Haffner, David P.] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD 20706 USA; [Poole, Lamont R.] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Schoeberl, Mark R.] Sci & Technol Corp, Lanham, MD 20706 USA; [Davies, Jonathan; McElroy, C.

We use evolutionary signatures and comparisons with experimental data sets to suggest candidate functions for similar to 60% of constrained bases. These elements reveal a small number of new coding exons, candidate stop codon readthrough events and over 10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within protein-coding exons. We find 220 candidate RNA structural families, and nearly a million elements overlapping potential promoter, enhancer and insulator regions. We report specific amino acid residues that have undergone positive selection, 280,000 non-coding elements exapted from mobile elements and more than 1,000 primate-and human-accelerated elements.

Here we report the generation and analysis of exon-level transcriptome and associated genotyping data, representing males and females of different ethnicities, from multiple brain regions and neocortical areas of developing and adult post-mortem human brains. We found that 86 per cent of the genes analysed were expressed, and that 90 per cent of these were differentially regulated at the whole-transcript or exon level across brain regions and/or time. The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression.

They repeatedly eject 10(-4)-10(-5) solar masses of nucleosynthetically enriched gas into the interstellar medium, recurring on intervals of decades to tens of millennia. They are probably the main sources(3,4) of Galactic N-15, O-17 and C-13. The origin of the large enhancements and inhomogeneous distribution of these species observed in high-resolution spectra(5) of ejected nova shells has, however, remained unexplained for almost half a century(6). Several mechanisms(7), including mixing by diffusion(8), shear(9) or resonant gravity waves(10), have been proposed in the framework of one-dimensional or two-dimensional simulations, but none has hitherto proven successful because convective mixing can only be modelled accurately in three dimensions. Here we report the results of a three-dimensional nuclear-hydrodynamic simulation of mixing at the core-envelope interface during nova outbursts. We show that buoyant fingering drives vortices from the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which inevitably enriches the accreted envelope with material from the outer white-dwarf core. Such mixing also naturally produces large-scale chemical inhomogeneities. Both the metallicity enhancement and the intrinsic dispersions in the abundances are consistent with the observed values.","[Casanova, Jordi; Jose, Jordi] Univ Politecn Cataluna, EUETIB, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Casanova, Jordi; Jose, Jordi; Garcia-Berro, Enrique] Inst Estudis Espacials Catalunya, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Berro, Enrique] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis Aplicada, E-08860 Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain; [Shore, Steven N.] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Fis Enrico Fermi, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Shore, Steven N.] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Sez Pisa, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Calder, Alan C.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Phys & Astron, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Jose, J (reprint author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, EUETIB, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, C Comte Urgell 187, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain.",jordi.jose@upc.edu,"Calder, Alan/E-5348-2011; Garcia-Berro, Enrique/C-8034-2014","Garcia-Berro, Enrique/0000-0002-1623-5838",Department of Energy; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca of the Generalitat de Catalunya; E.U.

It resides at present at 95.7 astronomical units (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance) from Earth, near its aphelion and more than three times farther than Pluto. Owing to this great distance, measuring its size or detecting a putative atmosphere is difficult. Here we report the observation of a multi-chord stellar occultation by Eris on 6 November 2010 UT. The event is consistent with a spherical shape for Eris, with radius 1,163 +/- 6 kilometres, density 2.52 +/- 0.05 grams per cm(3) and a high visible geometric albedo, p(V) = 0.96(-0.04)(+0.09). No nitrogen, argon or methane atmospheres are detected with surface pressure larger than similar to 1 nanobar, about 10,000 times more tenuous than Pluto's present atmosphere(2-5). As Pluto's radius is estimated(3-8) to be between 1,150 and 1,200 kilometres, Eris appears as a Pluto twin, with a bright surface possibly caused by a collapsed atmosphere, owing to its cold environment. We anticipate that this atmosphere may periodically sublimate as Eris approaches its perihelion, at 37.8 astronomical units from the Sun.","[Sicardy, B.; Lellouch, E.; Braga-Ribas, F.; Lecacheux, J.; Roques, F.; Santos-Sanz, P.; Widemann, T.] Univ Paris Diderot, Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LESIA Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Sicardy, B.] Univ Paris 06, F-75252 Paris 5, France; [Sicardy, B.] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France; [Ortiz, J.

Coherent optical techniques, such as coherent population trapping involving dark resonances(1,2), are widely used to control quantum states of isolated atoms and ions. In conjunction with spontaneous emission, they allow for laser cooling of atomic motion(3), preparation and manipulation of atomic states(4), and rapid quantum optical measurements that are essential for applications in metrology(5-7). Here we show that these techniques can be applied to monitor and control individual atom-like impurities, and their local environment(8-11), in the solid state. Using all-optical manipulation of the electronic spin of an individual nitrogen-vacancy colour centre in diamond, we demonstrate optical cooling, real-time measurement and conditional preparation of its nuclear spin environment by post-selection. These methods offer potential applications ranging from all-optical nanomagnetometry to quantum feedback control of solid-state qubits, and may lead to new approaches for quantum information storage and processing","[Togan, E.; Chu, Y.; Lukin, M.

It has been difficult to generate synthetic analogues of these three active iron-oxygen species in identical host complexes, which is necessary to elucidate changes to the structure of the iron centre during catalysis and the factors that control their chemical reactivities with substrates. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of a mononuclear non-haem side-on iron(III)-peroxo complex, [Fe(III)(TMC)(OO)](+). We also report a series of chemical reactions in which this iron(III)-peroxo complex is cleanly converted to the iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex, [Fe(III)(TMC)(OOH)](2+), via a short-lived intermediate on protonation. This iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex then cleanly converts to the ferryl complex, [Fe(IV)(TMC)(O)](2+), via homolytic O-O bond cleavage of the iron(III)-hydroperoxo species. All three of these iron species-the three most biologically relevant iron-oxygen intermediates-have been spectroscopically characterized; we note that they have been obtained using a simple macrocyclic ligand. We have performed relative reactivity studies on these three iron species which reveal that the iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex is the most reactive of the three in the deformylation of aldehydes and that it has a similar reactivity to the iron(IV)-oxo complex in C-H bond activation of alkylaromatics. These reactivity results demonstrate that iron(III)-hydroperoxo species are viable oxidants in both nucleophilic and electrophilic reactions by iron-containing enzymes.","[Cho, Jaeheung; Jeon, Sujin; Kang, Eun A.; Valentine, Joan Selverstone; Nam, Wonwoo] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, Ctr Biomimet Syst, Dept Bioinspired Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Wilson, Samuel A.; Liu, Lei V.; Hodgson, Keith O.; Solomon, Edward I.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Braymer, Joseph J.; Lim, Mi Hee] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Braymer, Joseph J.; Lim, Mi Hee] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hedman, Britt; Hodgson, Keith O.; Solomon, Edward I.] Stanford Univ, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Valentine, Joan Selverstone] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Valentine, JS (reprint author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Chem & Nano Sci, Ctr Biomimet Syst, Dept Bioinspired Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",jsv@chem.ucla.edu; edward.solomon@stanford.edu; wwnam@ewha.ac.kr,"Liu, Lei/H-4942-2011","Nam, Wonwoo/0000-0001-8592-4867","NRF/MEST of Korea through the CRI; NRF/MEST of Korea through the GRL [2010-00353]; NRF/MEST of Korea through the WCU [R31-2008-000-10010-0]; NIH [GM 40392, RR-001209]; NSF [MCB 0919027]; NSF EAPSI [OISE-1014685]; University of Michigan; Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science; DOE, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; NIH, National Center for Research Resources [5P41RR001209]","The work was supported by NRF/MEST of Korea through the CRI (W.N.), the GRL (2010-00353; W.N.), the WCU (R31-2008-000-10010-0; W.N. and J.S.V.) and the 2011 KRICT OASIS Project (W.N.), by NIH grants GM 40392 (E.

This trend has important implications for infectious disease research because genomic data from ancient microbes may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes of pestilence-associated mortality in London, England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient organismis ancestral to most extant strains and sits very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis commonly associated with human infection. Temporal estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351 was the main historical event responsible for the introduction and widespread dissemination of the ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived increased virulence of the disease during the Black Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype. These findings support the notion that factors other than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding emerging Y. pestis infections.","[Schuenemann, Verena J.; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Bos, Kirsten I.; Poinar, Hendrik N.] McMaster Univ, Dept Anthropol, McMaster Ancient DNA Ctr, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Golding, G.

Insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) are highly effective, but the mechanism by which this chemical wards off biting insects remains controversial despite decades of investigation(1-11). DEET seems to act both at close range as a contact chemo-repellent, by affecting insect gustatory receptors(12), and at long range, by affecting the olfactory system(1-11). Two opposing mechanisms for the observed behavioural effects of DEET in the gas phase have been proposed: that DEET interferes with the olfactory system to block host odour recognition(1-7) and that DEET actively repels insects by activating olfactory neurons that elicit avoidance behaviour(8-11). Here we show that DEET functions as a modulator of the odour-gated ion channel formed by the insect odorant receptor complex(13,14). The functional insect odorant receptor complex consists of a common co-receptor, ORCO (ref. 15) (formerly called OR83B; ref. 16), and one or more variable odorant receptor subunits that confer odour selectivity(17). DEET acts on this complex to potentiate or inhibit odour-evoked activity or to inhibit odour-evoked suppression of spontaneous activity. This modulation depends on the specific odorant receptor and the concentration and identity of the odour ligand. We identify a single amino-acid polymorphism in the second transmembrane domain of receptor OR59B in a Drosophila melanogaster strain from Brazil that renders OR59B insensitive to inhibition by the odour ligand and modulation by DEET. Our data indicate that natural variation can modify the sensitivity of an odour-specific insect odorant receptor to odour ligands and DEET. Furthermore, they support the hypothesis that DEET acts as a molecular 'confusant' that scrambles the insect odour code, and provide a compelling explanation for the broad-spectrum efficacy of DEET against multiple insect species.","[Pellegrino, Maurizio; Steinbach, Nicole; Vosshall, Leslie B.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Vosshall, Leslie B.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Stensmyr, Marcus C.; Hansson, Bill S.] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Evolutionary Neuroethol, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Vosshall, LB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, 1230 York Ave,Box 63, New York, NY 10065 USA.",leslie.vosshall@rockefeller.edu,"Hansson, Bill/G-2774-2013","Hansson, Bill/0000-0002-4811-1223; Stensmyr, Marcus/0000-0003-4009-9212; Vosshall, Leslie/0000-0002-6060-8099",Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative; NIH [RO1 DC008600]; Max Planck Society,"We thank C.

The recognition of microbial ligands leads to the production of cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), that are essential for successful pathogen elimination. Cytosolic detection of pathogen-derived DNA is one major mechanism of inducing IFN production(1,2), and this process requires signalling through TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and its downstream transcription factor, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In addition, a transmembrane protein called STING (stimulator of IFN genes; also known as MITA, ERIS, MPYS and TMEM173) functions as an essential signalling adaptor, linking the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1-IRF3 signalling axis(3-7). Recently, unique nucleic acids called cyclic dinucleotides, which function as conserved signalling molecules in bacteria(8), have also been shown to induce a STING-dependent type I IFN response(9-12). However, a mammalian sensor of cyclic dinucleotides has not been identified. Here we report evidence that STING itself is an innate immune sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. We demonstrate that STING binds directly to radiolabelled cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and we show that unlabelled cyclic dinucleotides, but not other nucleotides or nucleic acids, compete with c-di-GMP for binding to STING. Furthermore, we identify mutations in STING that selectively affect the response to cyclic dinucleotides without affecting the response to DNA. Thus, STING seems to function as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides, in addition to its established role as a signalling adaptor in the IFN response to cytosolic DNA. Cyclic dinucleotides have shown promise as novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutics(9,13), and our results provide insight into the mechanism by which cyclic dinucleotides are sensed by the innate immune system.","[Burdette, Dara L.; Monroe, Kathryn M.; Sotelo-Troha, Katia; Iwig, Jeff S.; Eckert, Barbara; Vance, Russell E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Iwig, Jeff S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hyodo, Mamoru] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600812, Japan; [Hayakawa, Yoshihiro] Aichi Inst Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Appl Chem, Toyota 4700392, Japan","Vance, RE (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rvance@berkeley.edu,"Hyodo, Mamoru/D-5496-2012","Hyodo, Mamoru/0000-0002-1766-3949","Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Cancer Research Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI075039, AI080749, AI063302, F32 (AI091100)]","We thank H.

To gain a global molecular perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles. Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular architecture in the prefrontal cortex, despite millions of genetic differences across individuals and races. To enable further discovery, this entire data set is freely available (from Gene Expression Omnibus: accession GSE30272; and dbGaP: accession phs000417.v1.p1) and can also be interrogated via a biologist-friendly stand-alone application (http://www.libd.org/braincloud).","[Colantuoni, Carlo; Lipska, Barbara K.; Ye, Tianzhang; Hyde, Thomas M.; Tao, Ran; Herman, Mary M.; Weinberger, Daniel R.; Kleinman, Joel E.] NIMH, Sect Neuropathol, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program,IRP,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Colantuoni, Carlo; Leek, Jeffrey T.; Colantuoni, Elizabeth A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Colantuoni, Carlo] Illuminato Biotechnol Inc, Baltimore, MD 21211 USA; [Colantuoni, Carlo; Hyde, Thomas M.; Weinberger, Daniel R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Med Ctr, Lieber Inst Brain Dev, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Elkahloun, Abdel G.] NHGRI, Canc Genet Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Kleinman, JE (reprint author), NIMH, Sect Neuropathol, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program,IRP,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",kleinmaj@mail.nih.gov,"Tao, Ran/C-2662-2013; Tao, Ran/L-3460-2014; Lipska, Barbara/E-4569-2017","Leek, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2873-2671","Intramural NIH HHS [ZIC HG200365-01, ZIC HG200365-02, ZIC HG200365-03]",,,27,294,297,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2011,478,7370,,,,,519,U117,,10.1038/nature10524,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,837JI,WOS:000296194200044,22031444,No,,,11/20/17

Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs(1). Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states(2). By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.","[Lowe, Scott W.; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Zuber, Johannes] Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Shi, Junwei] SUNY Stony Brook, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rappaport, Amy R.; Lowe, Scott W.] Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Sison, Edward A.; Magoon, Daniel; Brown, Patrick] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Pediat Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Qi, Jun; Bradner, James E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Blatt, Katharina; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Wunderlich, Mark; Mulloy, James C.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Expt Hematol & Canc Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kogan, Scott C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Vakoc, CR (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",lowe@cshl.edu; vakoc@cshl.edu,"Clovis, Jeff/C-1020-2009","Vakoc, Christopher/0000-0002-1158-7180",Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation; Laurie Strauss Leukemia Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG); CSHL; NIH; Barbara McClintock fellowship; Damon-Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Smith Family Foundation; Damon Runyon-Lilly Clinical Investigator Award; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS); Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America; National Cancer Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; CSHL President's Council; SASS Foundation for Medical Research,"We thank B.

Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction(2,3). Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC(2,3) and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc)(4,5), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.","[Dawson, Mark A.; Giotopoulos, George; Chan, Wai-In; Gudgin, Emma; Huntly, Brian J.

It mediates the aldol condensation of heat-labile dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to FBP(4), as well as the subsequent, irreversible hydrolysis of the product to yield the stable fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and inorganic phosphate; no reaction intermediates are released. Here we present a series of structural snapshots of the reaction that reveal a substantial remodelling of the active site through the movement of loop regions that create different catalytic functionalities at the same location. We have solved the three-dimensional structures of FBP aldolase/phosphatase from thermophilic Thermoproteus neutrophilus(5,6) in a ligand-free state as well as in complex with the substrates DHAP and FBP and the product F6P to resolutions up to 1.3 angstrom. In conjunction with mutagenesis data, this pinpoints the residues required for the two reaction steps and shows that the sequential binding of additional Mg(2+) cations reversibly facilitates the reaction.

Although some are referred to as being bifunctional, they consist of either two distinct catalytic domains or a single domain that displays promiscuous substrate specificity(1). Thus, one enzyme active site is generally responsible for one biochemical reaction. In contrast to this conventional concept, archaeal fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase/phosphatase (FBPA/P) consists of a single catalytic domain, but catalyses two chemically distinct reactions of gluconeogenesis: (1) the reversible aldol condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P) to FBP; (2) the dephosphorylation of FBP to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P)(2). Thus, FBPA/P is fundamentally different from ordinary enzymes whose active sites are responsible for a specific reaction. However, the molecular mechanism by which FBPA/P achieves its unusual bifunctionality remains unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of FBPA/P at 1.5-angstrom resolution in the aldolase form, where a critical lysine residue forms a Schiff base with DHAP. A structural comparison of the aldolase form with a previously determined phosphatase form(3) revealed a dramatic conformational change in the active site, demonstrating that FBPA/P metamorphoses its active-site architecture to exhibit dual activities. Thus, our findings expand the conventional concept that one enzyme catalyses one biochemical reaction.","[Fushinobu, Shinya; Hattori, Daiki; Song, Hyun-Jin; Wakagi, Takayoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Nishimasu, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Wakagi, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",atwakag@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Fushinobu, Shinya/E-4987-2011","Fushinobu, Shinya/0000-0003-1346-6435",,,,15,28,31,2,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Oct,2011,478,7370,,,,,538,U139,,10.1038/nature10457,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,837JI,WOS:000296194200048,21983966,No,,,11/20/17

Its biosynthesis involves the separate syntheses of the pyrimidine 2 and thiazole 3 precursors, which are then coupled(2). Two biosynthetic routes to the thiamine thiazole have been identified. In prokaryotes, five enzymes act on three substrates to produce the thiazole via a complex oxidative condensation reaction, the mechanistic details of which are now well established(2-6). In contrast, only one gene product is involved in thiazole biosynthesis in eukaryotes (THI4p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae)(7). Here we report the preparation of fully active recombinant wild-type THI4p, the identification of an iron-dependent sulphide transfer reaction from a conserved cysteine residue of the protein to a reaction intermediate and the demonstration that THI4p is a suicide enzyme undergoing only a single turnover.","[Abeydeera, N.

Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.","[Foley, Jonathan A.; Brauman, Kate A.; Cassidy, Emily S.; Gerber, James S.; Johnston, Matt; Mueller, Nathaniel D.; O'Connell, Christine; Ray, Deepak K.; West, Paul C.; Hill, Jason; Polasky, Stephen; Sheehan, John; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm IonE, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Global Environm & Climate Change Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [O'Connell, Christine] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Bennett, Elena M.] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Bennett, Elena M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Carpenter, Stephen R.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hill, Jason] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Monfreda, Chad] Arizona State Univ, CSPO, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Rockstrom, Johan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Siebert, Stefan] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Zaks, David P.
