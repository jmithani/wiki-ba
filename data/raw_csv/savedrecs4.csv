The localization and persistence of antibodies at these sites is influenced by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)(1,2), whose role in protecting against infection in vivo has not been defined. Here, we show that a bnAb with enhanced FcRn binding has increased gut mucosal tissue localization, which improves protection against lentiviral infection in non-human primates. A bnAb directed to the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein (denoted VRC01)(3) was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to increase its binding affinity for FcRn. This enhanced FcRn-binding mutant bnAb, denoted VRC01-LS, displayed increased transcytosis across human FcRn-expressing cellular monolayers in vitro while retaining Fc gamma RIIIa binding and function, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, at levels similar to VRC01 (the wild type). VRC01-LS had a threefold longer serum half-life than VRC01 in non-human primates and persisted in the rectal mucosa even when it was no longer detectable in the serum. Notably, VRC01-LSmediated protection superior to that afforded by VRC01 against intrarectal infection with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). These findings suggest that modification of FcRn binding provides a mechanism not only to increase serum half-life but also to enhance mucosal localization that confers immune protection. Mutations that enhance FcRn function could therefore increase the potency and durability of passive immunization strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection.","[Ko, Sung-Youl; Pegu, Amarendra; Rudicell, Rebecca S.; Yang, Zhi-yong; Joyce, M.

An example is the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a 13-subunit ubiquitin ligase that initiates the metaphase-anaphase transition and mitotic exit by targeting proteins such as securin and cyclin B1 for ubiquitin-dependent destruction by the proteasome(1,2). Because blocking mitotic exit is an effective approach for inducing tumour cell death(3,4), the APC/Crepresents a potential novel target for cancer therapy. APC/C activation in mitosis requires binding of Cdc20 (ref. 5), which forms a co-receptor with the APC/C to recognize substrates containing a destruction box(D-box)(6-14). Here we demonstrate that we can synergistically inhibit APC/C-dependent proteolysis and mitotic exit by simultaneously disrupting two protein-protein interactions within the APC/C-Cdc20-substrate ternary complex. We identify a small molecule, called apcin (APC inhibitor), which binds to Cdc20 and competitively inhibits the ubiquitylation of D-box-containing substrates. Analysis of the crystal structure of the apcin-Cdc20 complex suggests that apcin occupies the D-box-binding pocket on the side face of the WD40-domain. The ability of apcin to block mitotic exit is synergistically amplified by co-addition of tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, a small molecule that blocks the APC/C-Cdc20 interaction(15,16). This work suggests that simultaneous disruption of multiple, weak protein-protein interactions is an effective approach for inactivating a protein machine.","[Sackton, Katharine L.; Dimova, Nevena; Zeng, Xing; Zhang, Mengmeng; Meaders, Johnathan; Pfaff, Kathleen L.; Sigoillot, Frederic; King, Randall W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tian, Wei; Yu, Hongtao; Luo, Xuelian] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sackton, Timothy B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yu, Hongtao] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","King, RW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",randy_king@hms.harvard.edu,,"Sackton, Timothy/0000-0003-1673-9216; Yu, Hongtao/0000-0002-8861-049X","US Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Institutes of Health [GM085004, GM066492]; Lynch Foundation","We thank W.

Natural antisense RNAs are found in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms(2-5). Nevertheless, the physiological importance and mode of action of most antisense RNAs are not clear(6-9). frequency (frq) encodes a component of the Neurospora core circadian negative feedback loop, which was thought to generate sustained rhythmicity(10). Transcription of qrf, the long non-coding frq antisense RNA, is induced by light, and its level oscillates in antiphase to frq sense RNA(3). Here we show that qrf transcription is regulated by both light-dependent and light-independent mechanisms. Light-dependent qrf transcription represses frq expression and regulates clock resetting. Light-independent qrf expression, on the other hand, is required for circadian rhythmicity. frq transcription also inhibits qrf expression and drives the antiphasic rhythm of qrf transcripts. The mutual inhibition of frq and qrf transcription thus forms a double negative feedback loop that is interlocked with the core feedback loop. Genetic and mathematical modelling analyses indicate that such an arrangement is required for robust and sustained circadian rhythmicity. Moreover, our results suggest that antisense transcription inhibits sense expression by mediating chromatin modifications and premature termination of transcription. Taken together, our results establish antisense transcription as an essential feature in a circadian system and shed light on the importance and mechanism of antisense action.","[Xue, Zhihong; Ye, Qiaohong; Liu, Yi] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Anson, Simon R.; Crosthwaite, Susan K.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Yang, Jichen; Xiao, Guanghua] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Kowbel, David; Glass, N.

Pre-fusion gp41 encircles amino- and carboxy-terminal strands of gp120 with four helices that form a membrane-proximal collar, fastened by insertion of a fusion peptide-proximal methionine into a gp41-tryptophan clasp. Spike rearrangements required for entry involve opening the clasp and expelling the termini. N-linked glycosylation and sequence-variable regions cover the pre-fusion closed spike; we used chronic cohorts to map the prevalence and location of effective HIV-1-neutralizing responses, which were distinguished by their recognition of N-linked glycan and tolerance for epitope-sequence variation.","[Pancera, Marie; Zhou, Tongqing; Druz, Aliaksandr; Georgiev, Ivelin S.; Soto, Cinque; Gorman, Jason; Acharya, Priyamvada; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Ofek, Gilad; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B.

These asteroids and comets produce a large amount of dust and gas through collisions and evaporation, as happened early in the history of our Solar System(7). Spectroscopic observations of beta Pictoris reveal a high rate of transits of small evaporating bodies(8-11), that is, exocomets. Here we report an analysis of more than 1,000 archival spectra gathered between 2003 and 2011, which provides a sample of about 6,000 variable absorption signatures arising from exocomets transiting the disk of the parent star. Statistical analysis of the observed properties of these exocomets allows us to identify two populations with different physical properties. One family consists of exocomets producing shallow absorption lines, which can be attributed to old exhausted (that is, strongly depleted in volatiles) comets trapped in a mean motion resonance with a massive planet. Another family consists of exocomets producing deep absorption lines, which may be related to the recent fragmentation of one or a few parent bodies. Our results show that the evaporating bodies observed for decades in the beta Pictoris system are analogous to the comets in our own Solar System.","[Kiefer, F.; des Etangs, A.

Two possible models have emerged. In the first, a twisted flux rope moves out of equilibrium or becomes unstable, and the subsequent reconnection then powers the ejection(2-5). In the second, a new flux rope forms as a result of the reconnection of the magnetic lines of an arcade (a group of arches of field lines) during the eruption itself(6). Observational support for both mechanisms has been claimed(7-9). Here we report modelling which demonstrates that twisted flux ropes lead to the ejection, in support of the first model. After seeing a coronal mass ejection, we use the observed photospheric magnetic field in that region from four days earlier as a boundary condition to determine the magnetic field configuration. The field evolves slowly before the eruption, such that it can be treated effectively as a static solution. We find that on the fourth day a flux rope forms and grows (increasing its free energy). This solution then becomes the initial condition as we let the model evolve dynamically under conditions driven by photospheric changes (such as flux cancellation). When the magnetic energy stored in the configuration is too high, no equilibrium is possible and the flux rope is squeezed upwards. The subsequent reconnection drives a mass ejection.","[Amari, Tahar; Canou, Aurelien] Ecole Polytech, Ctr Phys Theor, CNRS, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Aly, Jean-Jacques] Univ Paris 07, AIM, CNRS, Ctr Etud Saclay,UMR CEA,UMR 7158, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Amari, T (reprint author), Ecole Polytech, Ctr Phys Theor, CNRS, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",amari@cpht.polytechnique.fr,,,Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES),"The numerical simulations described in this paper were performed on the IBM x3750 of the IDRIS institute of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).

With their high crystallinity and ability to withstand enormous strain(4-6), two-dimensional materials are of great interest as high-performance piezoelectric materials. Monolayer MoS2 is predicted to be strongly piezoelectric, an effect that disappears in the bulk owing to the opposite orientations of adjacent atomic layers(7,8). Here we report the first experimental study of the piezoelectric properties of two-dimensional MoS2 and show that cyclic stretching and releasing of thin MoS2 flakes with an odd number of atomic layers produces oscillating piezoelectric voltage and current outputs, whereas no output is observed for flakes with an even number of layers. A single monolayer flake strained by 0.53% generates a peak output of 15 mV and 20 pA, corresponding to a power density of 2 mW m(-2) and a 5.08% mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the output increases with decreasing thickness and reverses sign when the strain direction is rotated by 90 degrees. Transport measurements show a strong piezotronic effect in single-layer MoS2, but not in bilayer and bulk MoS2. The coupling between piezoelectricity and semiconducting properties in two-dimensional nanomaterials may enable the development of applications in powering nanodevices, adaptive bioprobes and tunable/stretchable electronics/optoelectronics.","[Wu, Wenzhuo; Lin, Long; Niu, Simiao; Wang, Zhong Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Wang, Lei] Columbia Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Li, Yilei; Heinz, Tony F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhang, Fan; Chenet, Daniel; Zhang, Xian; Hao, Yufeng; Hone, James] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wang, Zhong Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Nanoenergy & Nanosyst, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Wang, ZL (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jh2228@columbia.edu; zhong.wang@mse.gatech.edu,"Wang, Zhong Lin/E-2176-2011; hao, yufeng/B-9178-2013; Hone, James/E-1879-2011; Wu, Wenzhuo/G-1334-2010; Heinz, Tony/K-7797-2015; Niu, Simiao/D-3019-2012","Wang, Zhong Lin/0000-0002-5530-0380; Hone, James/0000-0002-8084-3301; Wu, Wenzhuo/0000-0003-0362-6650; Heinz, Tony/0000-0003-1365-9464; Niu, Simiao/0000-0003-1973-2204; Wang, Lei/0000-0002-1919-9107","US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-FG02-07ER46394]; US National Science Foundation [DMR-1122594]; 'Thousands Talents' programme for pioneer researcher and his innovation team, National Natural Science Foundation of China [51432005]; China and Beijing City Committee of Science and Technology [Z131100006013004, Z131100006013005]","We thank C.

The preparation and characterization of compounds containing elements with unusual oxidation states is of great interest to chemists(5). The highest experimentally known formal oxidation state of any chemical element is at present VIII2-4, although higher oxidation states have been postulated(6,7). Compounds with oxidation state VIII include several xenon compounds(8) (for example XeO4 and XeO3F2) and the well-characterized species RuO4 and OsO4 (refs 2-4). Iridium, which has nine valence electrons, is predicted to have the greatest chance of being oxidized beyond the VIII oxidation state(1). In recent matrix-isolation experiments, the IrO4 molecule was characterized as an isolated molecule in rare-gas matrices(9). The valence electron configuration of iridium in IrO4 is 5d(1), with a formal oxidation state of VIII. Removal of the remaining d electron from IrO4 would lead to the iridium tetroxide cation ([IrO4](+)), which was recently predicted to be stable(10) and in which iridium is in a formal oxidation state of IX. There has been some speculation about the formation of [IrO4](+) species(11,12), but these experimental observations have not been structurally confirmed. Here we report the formation of [IrO4](+) and its identification by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out at the highest level of theory that is available today, and predict that the iridium tetroxide cation, with a T-d-symmetrical structure and a d(0) electron configuration, is the most stable of all possible [IrO4](+) isomers.","[Wang, Guanjun; Zhou, Mingfei] Fudan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Catalysts & Innovat Mat, Dept Chem, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Goettel, James T.; Schrobilgen, Gary J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Su, Jing; Li, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Su, Jing; Li, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Key Lab Organ Optoelect & Mol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Schloeder, Tobias; Riedel, Sebastian] Univ Freiburg, Inst Anorgan & Analyt Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Riedel, Sebastian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem Anorgan Chem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Zhou, MF (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Catalysts & Innovat Mat, Dept Chem, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",mfzhou@fudan.edu.cn; schrobil@mcmaster.ca; sriedel@psichem.de,"Li, Jun/E-5334-2011; China, iChEM/F-2855-2015","Li, Jun/0000-0002-8456-3980; Goettel, James/0000-0001-8120-3771","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB834603, 2012YQ220113-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21173053, 21433005, 91026003]; Committee of Science and Technology of Shanghai [13XD1400800]; Fonds der Chemischen Industrie; GRK [1582]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2013CB834603 and 2012YQ220113-3), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 21173053, 21433005 and 91026003), the Committee of Science and Technology of Shanghai (13XD1400800), the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie and the GRK 1582 'Fluorine as a key element'.

It is thought that the thawing of permafrost can lead to a loss of soil carbon in the form of methane and carbon dioxide emissions(2,3). The magnitude of the resulting positive climate feedback of such greenhouse gas emissions is still unknown(3) and may to a large extent depend on the poorly understood role of microbial community composition in regulating the metabolic processes that drive such ecosystem-scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Here we show that changes in vegetation and increasing methane emissions with permafrost thaw are associated with a switch from hydrogenotrophic to partly acetoclastic methanogenesis, resulting in a large shift in the delta C-13 signature (1015 parts per thousand) of emitted methane. We used a natural landscape gradient of permafrost thaw in northern Sweden(4,5) as a model to investigate the role of microbial communities in regulating methane cycling, and to test whether a knowledge of community dynamics could improve predictions of carbon emissions under loss of permafrost. Abundance of the methanogen Candidatus Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis(6) is a key predictor of the shifts in methane isotopes, which in turn predicts the proportions of carbon emitted as methane and as carbon dioxide, an important factor for simulating the climate feedback associated with permafrost thaw in global models(3,7). By showing that the abundance of key microbial lineages can be used to predict atmospherically relevant patterns in methane isotopes and the proportion of carbon metabolized to methane during permafrost thaw, we establish a basis for scaling changing microbial communities to ecosystem isotope dynamics. Our findings indicate that microbial ecology may be important in ecosystem-scale responses to global change.","[McCalley, Carmody K.; Wehr, Richard A.; Saleska, Scott R.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Woodcroft, Ben J.; Mondav, Rhiannon; Tyson, Gene W.] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Ecogen, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hodgkins, Suzanne B.; Chanton, Jeffrey P.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Eun-Hae; Rich, Virginia I.] Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Crill, Patrick M.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","McCalley, CK (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",carmody.mccalley@unh.edu; saleska@email.arizona.edu,"Tyson, Gene/C-6558-2013; Mondav, Rhiannon/M-1219-2017","Mondav, Rhiannon/0000-0002-5574-5531; Wehr, Richard/0000-0002-0806-9390; Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059","US Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DE-SC0004632]; University of Arizona Technology and Research Initiative Fund, through the Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiative; Australian Postgraduate Award Scholarship","We thank the Abisko Scientific Research Station for infrastructure and logistical support; T.

If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources(2). The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(3-6). Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal(7,8). Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energyeconomyclimate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope(9,10) or its coverage of greenhouse gases(2). Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models(11) of energyeconomyclimate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy(9,10).","[McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Clarke, Leon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bauer, Nico; Hilaire, Jerome] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fisher, Brian; Mi, Raymond] BAEconomics, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; [Flannery, Brian P.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, I-20156 Milan, Italy","McJeon, H (reprint author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",haewon.mcjeon@pnnl.gov,"Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011","Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Flannery, Brian/0000-0002-3318-8068; Hilaire, Jerome/0000-0002-9879-6339","BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project","B.F. and R.M. and their development of BAEGEM were supported by BAEconomics with assistance for special applications to the resource sector from Rio Tinto (Australia).

Here we address this challenge by conducting a total of 153 site-year field experiments covering the main agro-ecological areas for rice, wheat and maize production in China. A set of integrated soil-crop system management practices based on a modern understanding of crop ecophysiology and soil biogeochemistry increases average yields for rice, wheat and maize from 7.2 million grams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), 7.2 Mg ha(-1) and 10.5 Mg ha(-1) to 8.5 Mg ha(-1), 8.9 Mg ha(-1) and 14.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively, without any increase in nitrogen fertilizer. Model simulation and life-cycle assessment(3) show that reactive nitrogen losses and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced substantially by integrated soil-crop system management. If farmers in China could achieve average grain yields equivalent to 80% of this treatment by 2030, over the same planting area as in 2012, total production of rice, wheat and maize in China would be more than enough to meet the demand for direct human consumption and a substantially increased demand for animal feed, while decreasing the environmental costs of intensive agriculture.","[Chen, Xinping; Cui, Zhenling; Fan, Mingsheng; Wang, Guiliang; Wu, Liang; An, Ning; Wu, Liangquan; Ma, Lin; Zhang, Weifeng; Zhang, Fusuo] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Vitousek, Peter] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhao, Ming; Zhang, Weijian] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wenqi] Agr Univ Hebei, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Baoding 071001, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhenlin; Zhang, Jiwang; He, Mingrong] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Tai An 271000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yan, Xiaoyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jianchang] Yangzhou Univ, Key Lab Crop Genet & Physiol Jiangsu Prov, Yangzhou 225009, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiping; Li, Shiqing] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Gao, Qiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiang] Shanxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Environm & Resource, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China; [Guo, Shiwei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jun] Jilin Acad Agr Sci, Res Ctr Agr Environm & Resources, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China; [Ye, Youliang; Zhu, Yunji] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaohui; Xue, Jiquan] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jianliang] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Tang, Qiyuan] Hunan Agr Univ, Crop Physiol Ecol & Prod Ctr, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yixiang] Anhui Acad Agr Sci, Soil & Fertilizer Res Inst, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xianlong] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China","Zhang, FS (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",zhangfs@cau.edu.cn,"Yan, Xiaoyuan/M-9840-2016","Yan, Xiaoyuan/0000-0001-8645-4836; _, __/0000-0003-4577-9217",Chinese National Basic Research Program [2009CB118600]; NSFC [31121062]; Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [201103003],"We thank P.

Although non-vertebrate chordates display nested domains of axial Hox expression, they lack hindbrain segmentation. The sea lamprey, a jawless fish, can provide unique insights into vertebrate origins owing to its phylogenetic position at the base of the vertebrate tree(1-3). It has been suggested that lamprey may represent an intermediate state where nested Hox expression has not been coupled to the process of hindbrain segmentation(4-6). However, little is known about the regulatory network underlying Hox expression in lamprey or its relationship to hindbrain segmentation. Here, using a novel tool that allows cross-species comparisons of regulatory elements between jawed and jawless vertebrates, we report deep conservation of both upstream regulators and segmental activity of enhancer elements across these distant species. Regulatory regions from diverse gnathostomes drive segmental reporter expression in the lamprey hindbrain and require the same transcriptional inputs (for example, Kreisler (also known as Mafba), Krox20 (also known as Egr2a)) in both lamprey and zebrafish. We find that lamprey hox genes display dynamic segmentally restricted domains of expression; we also isolated a conserved exonic hox2 enhancer from lamprey that drives segmental expression in rhombomeres 2 and 4. Our results show that coupling of Hox gene expression to segmentation of the hindbrain is an ancient trait with origin at the base of vertebrates that probably led to the formation of rhombomeric compartments with an underlying Hox code.","[Parker, Hugo J.; Krumlauf, Robb] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Bronner, Marianne E.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Krumlauf, Robb] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Krumlauf, R (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",rek@Stowers.org,,"Bronner, Marianne/0000-0003-4274-1862",Stowers Institute [2013-1001];  [R01N5086907];  [R01DE017911],"We thank S.

This notion, however, is incompatible with archaeological evidence of pre-contact tuberculosis in the New World(2). Comparative genomics of modern isolates suggests that M. tuberculosis attained its worldwide distribution following human dispersals out of Africa during the Pleistocene epoch(3), although this has yet to be confirmed with ancient calibration points. Here we present three 1,000-year-old mycobacterial genomes from Peruvian human skeletons, revealing that a member of the M. tuberculosis complex caused human disease before contact. The ancient strains are distinct from known human-adapted forms and are most closely related to those adapted to seals and sea lions. Two independent dating approaches suggest a most recent common ancestor for the M. tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years ago, which supports a Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our results implicate sea mammals as having played a role in transmitting the disease to humans across the ocean.","[Bos, Kirsten I.; Herbig, Alexander; Forrest, Stephen A.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Majander, Kerttu; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Dept Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Harkins, Kelly M.; Wilbur, Alicia K.; Buikstra, Jane E.; Stone, Anne C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Herbig, Alexander; Weber, Nico; Huson, Daniel; Nieselt, Kay] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Coscolla, Mireia; Gagneux, Sebastien] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Med Parasitol & Infect Biol, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Coscolla, Mireia; Gagneux, Sebastien] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Comas, Inaki] FISABIO Publ Hlth, Genom & Hlth Unit, Valencia 46020, Spain; [Comas, Inaki] Inst Salud Carlos III, CIBER Ctr Invest Biomed Red Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Bryant, Josephine M.; Parkhill, Julian] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Campbell, Tessa J.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Archaeol, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Guichon, Ricardo A.] UNMDP, FCEyN, Dept Biol, CONICET,Lab Ecologia Evolut Humana FACSO,UNCPBA, RA-7631 Quequen, Argentina; [Steadman, Dawnie L.

Here we report that the physical elasticity of lymph nodes is maintained in part by podoplanin (PDPN) signalling in stromal fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and its modulation by CLEC-2 expressed on dendritic cells. We show in mouse cells that PDPN induces actomyosin contractility in FRCs via activation of RhoA/C and downstream Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Engagement by CLEC-2 causes PDPN clustering and rapidly uncouples PDPN from RhoA/C activation, relaxing the actomyosin cytoskeleton and permitting FRC stretching. Notably, administration of CLEC-2 protein to immunized mice augments lymph node expansion. In contrast, lymph node expansion is significantly constrained in mice selectively lacking CLEC-2 expression in dendritic cells. Thus, the same dendritic cells that initiate immunity by presenting antigens to T lymphocytes(3) also initiate remodelling of lymph nodes by delivering CLEC-2 to FRCs. CLEC-2 modulation of PDPN signalling permits FRC network stretching and allows for the rapid lymph node expansion-driven by lymphocyte influx and proliferation-that is the critical hallmark of adaptive immunity.","[Acton, Sophie E.; Farrugia, Aaron J.; Mourao-Sa, Diego; van Blijswijk, Janneke; Rogers, Neil C.; Snelgrove, Kathryn J.; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Acton, Sophie E.] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Farrugia, Aaron J.; Jenkins, Robert P.; Hooper, Steven; Sahai, Erik] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Tumour Cell Biol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Astarita, Jillian L.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nye, Emma; Stamp, Gordon] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Expt Histopathol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Rosewell, Ian] Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Transgen Lab, Potters Bar EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Moita, Luis F.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal; [Moita, Luis F.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Med Mol, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Turley, Shannon J.] Genentech Inc, Dept Canc Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Acton, SE (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Immunobiol Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, England.",sophie.acton@cancer.org.uk; caetano@cancer.org.uk,"Acton, Sophie/G-9784-2012","Acton, Sophie/0000-0003-2704-716X; Moita, Luis/0000-0003-0707-315X; Reis e Sousa, Caetano/0000-0001-7392-2119; Sahai, Erik/0000-0002-3932-5086",Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral fellowship; Cancer Research UK,"We thank B.

Restoration of insulin production in type 1 diabetes is thus a major medical challenge. We previously observed in mice in which beta-cells are completely ablated that the pancreas reconstitutes new insulin-producing cells in the absence of autoimmunity(3). The process involves the contribution of islet non-beta-cells; specifically, glucagon-producing alpha-cells begin producing insulin by a process of reprogramming (transdifferentiation) without proliferation(3). Here we show the influence of age on beta-cell reconstitution from heterologous islet cells after near-total beta-cell loss in mice. We found that senescence does not alter alpha-cell plasticity: alpha-cells can reprogram to produce insulin from puberty through to adulthood, and also in aged individuals, even a long time after beta-cell loss. In contrast, before puberty there is no detectable alpha-cell conversion, although beta-cell reconstitution after injury is more efficient, always leading to diabetes recovery. This process occurs through a newly discovered mechanism: the spontaneous en masse reprogramming of somatostatin-producing delta-cells. The juveniles display somatostatin-to-insulin delta-cell conversion, involving dedifferentiation, proliferation and re-expression of islet developmental regulators. This juvenile adaptability relies, at least in part, upon the combined action of FoxO1 and downstream effectors. Restoration of insulin producing-cells from non-beta-cell origins is thus enabled throughout life via delta- or alpha-cell spontaneous reprogramming. A landscape with multiple intra-islet cell interconversion events is emerging, offering new perspectives for therapy.","[Chera, Simona; Baronnier, Delphine; Ghila, Luiza; Cigliola, Valentina; Furuyama, Kenichiro; Thorel, Fabrizio; Herrera, Pedro L.] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Jensen, Jan N.] Novo Nordisk AS, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark; [Gu, Guoqiang] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Gribble, Fiona M.; Reimann, Frank] Cambridge Inst Med Res, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England","Herrera, PL (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",pedro.herrera@unige.ch,"CHERA, Simona/N-3207-2014","CHERA, Simona/0000-0001-6310-3486; GHILA, Luiza/0000-0001-7173-6312","Wellcome Trust [WT088357/Z/09/Z, WT084210/Z/07/Z]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Beta Cell Biology Consortium); Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation [NRP63]","We are grateful to D.

There is substantial evidence suggesting that diet markedly affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota(2). Moreover, there is now unequivocal evidence linking dysbiosis to cancer development(3). However, the mechanisms by which high-fat diet (HFD)-mediated changes in the microbial community affect the severity of tumorigenesis in the gut remain to be determined. Here we demonstrate that an HFD promotes tumour progression in the small intestine of genetically susceptible, K-ras(G12Dint), mice independently of obesity. HFD consumption, in conjunction with K-ras mutation, mediated a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota, and this shift was associated with a decrease in Paneth-cell-mediated antimicrobial host defence that compromised dendritic cell recruitment and MHC class II molecule presentation in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. When butyrate was administered to HFD-fed K-ras(G12Dint) mice, dendritic cell recruitment in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues was normalized, and tumour progression was attenuated. Importantly, deficiency in MYD88, a signalling adaptor for pattern recognition receptors and Toll-like receptors, blocked tumour progression. The transfer of faecal samples from HFD-fed mice with intestinal tumours to healthy adult K-ras(G12Dint) mice was sufficient to transmit disease in the absence of an HFD. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics completely blocked HFD-induced tumour progression, suggesting that distinct shifts in the microbiota have a pivotal role in aggravating disease. Collectively, these data underscore the importance of the reciprocal interaction between host and environmental factors in selecting a microbiota that favours carcinogenesis, and they suggest that tumorigenesis is transmissible among genetically predisposed individuals.","[Schulz, Manon D.; Atay, Cigdem; Heringer, Jessica; Romrig, Franziska K.; Schwitalla, Sarah; Arkan, Melek C.] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Mol Immunol, Klinikum Rechts Isar, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Aydin, Begum] Bogazici Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ziegler, Paul K.; Varga, Julia; Greten, Florian R.] Georg Speyer Haus, Inst Tumor Biol & Expt Therapy, D-60596 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ziegler, Paul K.; Varga, Julia; Kirchner, Thomas; Greten, Florian R.] German Canc Consortium DKTK, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Ziegler, Paul K.; Varga, Julia; Kirchner, Thomas; Greten, Florian R.] German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Reindl, Wolfgang] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Univ Med Mannheim, Dept Internal Med 2, D-68167 Mannheim, Germany; [Pommerenke, Claudia; Salinas-Riester, Gabriela] Univ Med Ctr Gottingen, Microarray & Deep Sequencing Core Facil, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Boeck, Andreas] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Math Stat, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Alpert, Carl; Blaut, Michael] German Inst Human Nutr Potsdam Rehbrucke, Dept Gastrointestinal Microbiol, D-14558 Nuthetal, Germany; [Polson, Sara C.; Polson, Shawn W.] Univ Delaware, Delaware Biotechnol Inst, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Newark, DE 19711 USA; [Brandl, Lydia; Kirchner, Thomas] Univ Munich, Inst Pathol, D-80337 Munich, Germany","Arkan, MC (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Mol Immunol, Klinikum Rechts Isar, D-81675 Munich, Germany.",canan.arkan@lrz.tum.de,,"Polson, Shawn/0000-0002-3398-6932; Greten, Florian/0000-0002-3928-6080","LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy Frankfurt (CGT) [III L 4-518/17.004]; Georg-Speyer-Haus; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Gr1916/5-1]; Deutsche Krebshilfe [108872, 107977]; ERC [ROSCAN-281967]; US National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences [8 P20 GM103446-12]; US National Science Foundation EPSCoR [EPS-081425]; DFG [AR710/2-1]","We thank K.

Drugs that target the function of key epigenetic factors have been approved in the context of haematopoietic disorders(1), and mutations that affect chromatin modulators in a variety of leukaemias have recently been identified(2,3); however, epigenetic drugs are not currently used for T-ALL treatment. Recently, we described that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has a tumour-suppressor role in T-ALL(4). Here we delineated the role of the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in T-ALL. We show that JMJD3 is essential for the initiation and maintenance of T-ALL, as it controls important oncogenic gene targets by modulating H3K27 methylation. By contrast, we found that UTX functions as a tumour suppressor and is frequently genetically inactivated in T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor GSKJ4 (ref. 5) affects T-ALL growth, by targeting JMJD3 activity. These findings show that two proteins with a similar enzymatic function can have opposing roles in the context of the same disease, paving the way for treating haematopoietic malignancies with a new category of epigenetic inhibitors.","[Ntziachristos, Panagiotis; Tsirigos, Aristotelis; Trimarchi, Thomas; Bakogianni, Sofia; Loizou, Evangelia; Strikoudis, Alexandros; King, Bryan; Mullenders, Jasper; Nedjic, Jelena; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ntziachristos, Panagiotis; Tsirigos, Aristotelis; Trimarchi, Thomas; Bakogianni, Sofia; Loizou, Evangelia; Strikoudis, Alexandros; King, Bryan; Mullenders, Jasper; Nedjic, Jelena; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ntziachristos, Panagiotis; Trimarchi, Thomas; Bakogianni, Sofia; Loizou, Evangelia; Strikoudis, Alexandros; King, Bryan; Mullenders, Jasper; Nedjic, Jelena; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, NYU Canc Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ntziachristos, Panagiotis; Trimarchi, Thomas; Bakogianni, Sofia; Loizou, Evangelia; Strikoudis, Alexandros; King, Bryan; Mullenders, Jasper; Nedjic, Jelena; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Stem Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Tsirigos, Aristotelis] NYU, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Informat & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Welstead, G.

It is required for signalling and proper functioning of a range of proteins involved in, for example, DNA binding and enzymatic catalysis(1). In prokaryotes and photosynthetic eukaryotes, Zn2+-transporting P-type ATPases of class IB (ZntA) are crucial for cellular redistribution and detoxification of Zn2+ and related elements(2,3). Here we present crystal structures representing the phosphoenzyme ground state (E2P) and a dephosphorylation intermediate (E2.P-i) of ZntA from Shigella sonnei, determined at 3.2 angstrom and 2.7 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a similar fold to Cu+-ATPases, with an amphipathic helix at the membrane interface. A conserved electronegative funnel connects this region to the intramembranous high-affinity ion-binding site and may promote specific uptake of cellular Zn2+ ions by the transporter. The E2P structure displays a wide extracellular release pathway reaching the invariant residues at the high-affinity site, including C392, C394 and D714. The pathway closes in the E2.P-i state, in which D714 interacts with the conserved residue K693, which possibly stimulates Zn2+ release as a built-in counter ion, as has been proposed for H+-ATPases. Indeed, transport studies in liposomes provide experimental support for ZntA activity without counter transport. These findings suggest a mechanistic link between P-IB-type Zn2+-ATPases and P-III-type H+-ATPases and at the same time show structural features of the extracellular release pathway that resemble P-II-type ATPases such as the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase(4,5) (SERCA) and Na+, K+-ATPase(6). These findings considerably increase our understanding of zinc transport in cells and represent new possibilities for biotechnology and biomedicine.","[Wang, Kaituo; Sitsel, Oleg; Meloni, Gabriele; Autzen, Henriette Elisabeth; Klymchuk, Tetyana; Nielsen, Anna Marie; Nissen, Poul; Gourdon, Pontus] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Danish Natl Res Fdn, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPkin, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Andersson, Magnus] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Theoret Phys, Swedish E Sci Res Ctr, Sci Life Lab, SE-17121 Solna, Sweden; [Rees, Douglas C.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rees, Douglas C.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Gourdon, P (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biomed Sci, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.",pontus@sund.ku.dk,"Gourdon, Pontus/E-1076-2014; wang, kaituo/G-9249-2016","Gourdon, Pontus/0000-0002-8631-3539; wang, kaituo/0000-0002-5922-7109; Andersson, Magnus/0000-0002-3364-6647; Nissen, Poul/0000-0003-0948-6628",Graduate School of Science and Technology at Aarhus University; Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (European Commission) [252961]; Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [FP7-MC-CIG-618558]; European Research Council [250322 Biomemos]; Lundbeck Foundation; Swedish Research Council [K2013-99X-22251-01-5]; Danscatt program of the Danish Council of Independent Research; BioStruct-X [860],"We thank J.

We find the strongest signatures of selection associated with migration centre on flight muscle function, resulting in greater flight efficiency among migratory monarchs, and that variation in monarch warning colouration is controlled by a single myosin gene not previously implicated in insect pigmentation.","[Zhan, Shuai] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Key Lab Insect Dev & Evolutionary Biol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Shuai; Zhang, Wei; Kronforst, Marcus R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhan, Shuai; Reppert, Steven M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Niitepold, Kristjan; Hsu, Jeremy] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Niitepold, Kristjan] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fernandez Haeger, Juan] Univ Cordoba, Dept Bot Ecol & Fisiol Vegetal, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Zalucki, Myron P.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Altizer, Sonia] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [de Roode, Jacobus C.] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Zhan, S (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Key Lab Insect Dev & Evolutionary Biol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",szhan@sibs.ac.cn; mkronforst@uchicago.edu,"Zhang, Wei/P-1532-2015; Zalucki, Myron/G-7983-2012","Zalucki, Myron/0000-0001-9603-7577","National Institutes of Health [GM086794-02S1]; National Science Foundation [IOS-134367, DEB-0643831, DEB-1019746, DEB-1316037]; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences; University of Chicago","We thank B.

Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease.","[Sun, Jianlong; Ramos, Azucena; Le, Linda; Camargo, Fernando D.] Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sun, Jianlong; Camargo, Fernando D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sun, Jianlong; Camargo, Fernando D.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chapman, Brad; Hofmann, Oliver] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Johnnidis, Jonathan B.] Univ Penn, Dept Immunol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ho, Yu-Jui] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Klein, Allon] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Camargo, FD (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Camargo@fas.harvard.edu,,"Hofmann, Oliver/0000-0002-7738-1513","NIH [P30 DK049216, DP2OD006472]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute","We are grateful to members of the Camargo laboratory, L.

To gain a better understanding of how structural changes gate ion flux across the membrane, we trapped rat AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) and kainate receptor subtypes in their major functional states and analysed the resulting structures using cryo-electron microscopy. We show that transition to the active state involves a 'corkscrew' motion of the receptor assembly, driven by closure of the ligand-binding domain. Desensitization is accompanied by disruption of the amino-terminal domain tetramer in AMPA, but not kainate, receptors with a two-fold to four-fold symmetry transition in the ligand-binding domains in both subtypes. The 7.6 angstrom structure of a desensitized kainate receptor shows how these changes accommodate channel closing.

The lack of metals is expected to inhibit efficient gas cooling and star formation(1,2), but this effect has yet to be observed in galaxies with an oxygen abundance (relative to hydrogen) below a tenth of that of the Sun(2-4). Extremely metal poor nearby galaxies may be our best local laboratories for studying in detail the conditions that prevailed in low metallicity galaxies at early epochs. Carbon monoxide emission is unreliable as a tracer of gas at low metallicities(5-7), and while dust has been used to trace gas in low-metallicity galaxies(5,8-10), low spatial resolution in the far-infrared has typically led to large uncertainties(9,10). Here we report spatially resolved infrared observations of two galaxies with oxygen abundances below ten per cent of the solar value, and show that stars formed very inefficiently in seven star-forming clumps in these galaxies.

Novae typically expel about 10(-4) solar masses of material at velocities exceeding 1,000 kilometres per second. However, the mechanism of mass ejection in novae is poorly understood, and could be dominated by the impulsive flash of thermonuclear energy(2), prolonged optically thick winds(3) or binary interaction with the nova envelope(4). Classical novae are now routinely detected at gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray wavelengths(5), suggesting that relativistic particles are accelerated by strong shocks in the ejecta. Here we report high-resolution radio imaging of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon. We find that its ejecta were shaped by the motion of the binary system: some gas was expelled rapidly along the poles as a wind from the white dwarf, while denser material drifted out along the equatorial plane, propelled by orbital motion(6,7). At the interface between the equatorial and polar regions, we observe synchrotron emission indicative of shocks and relativistic particle acceleration, thereby pinpointing the location of gamma-ray production. Binary shaping of the nova ejecta and associated internal shocks are expected to be widespread among novae(8), explaining why many novae are gamma-ray emitters(5).","[Chomiuk, Laura; Linford, Justin D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yang, Jun] Chalmers, Onsala Space Observ, Dept Earth & Space Sci, SE-43992 Onsala, Sweden; [Yang, Jun; Paragi, Zsolt] Joint Inst VLBI Europe, NL-7990 AA Dwingeloo, Netherlands; [Yang, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [O'Brien, T.

The giant size of Rydberg atoms(1) leads to huge interaction effects. Monitoring these interactions has provided in-sights into atomic and molecular physics on the single-quantum level. Excitons-the fundamental optical excitations in semiconductors(2), consisting of an electron and a positively charged hole-are the condensed-matter analogues of hydrogen. Highly excited excitons with extensions similar to those of Rydberg atoms are of interest because they can be placed and moved in a crystal with high precision using microscopic energy potential landscapes. The interaction of such Rydberg excitons may allow the formation of ordered exciton phases or the sensing of elementary excitations in their surroundings on a quantum level. Here we demonstrate the existence of Rydberg excitons in the copper oxide Cu2O, with principal quantum numbers as large as n = 25. These states have giant wavefunction extensions (that is, the average distance between the electron and the hole) of more than two micrometres, compared to about a nanometre for the ground state.

Batteries have long been considered strong candidate solutions owing to their small spatial footprint, mechanical simplicity and flexibility in siting. However, the barrier to widespread adoption of batteries is their high cost. Here we describe a lithium-antimony-lead liquid metal battery that potentially meets the performance specifications for stationary energy storage applications. This Li parallel to Sb-Pb battery comprises a liquid lithium negative electrode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a liquid antimony-lead alloy positive electrode, which self-segregate by density into three distinct layers owing to the immiscibility of the contiguous salt and metal phases. The all-liquid construction confers the advantages of higher current density, longer cycle life and simpler manufacturing of large-scale storage systems (because no membranes or separators are involved) relative to those of conventional batteries(5,6). At charge-discharge current densities of 275 milliamperes per square centimetre, the cells cycled at 450 degrees Celsius with 98 per cent Coulombic efficiency and 73 per cent round-trip energy efficiency. To provide evidence of their high power capability, the cells were discharged and charged at current densities as high as 1,000 milliamperes per square centimetre. Measured capacity loss after operation for 1,800 hours (more than 450 charge-discharge cycles at 100 per cent depth of discharge) projects retention of over 85 per cent of initial capacity after ten years of daily cycling.

Apart from the fact that this finding puts us on a desirable cost trajectory, this approach may well be more broadly applicable to other battery chemistries.","[Wang, Kangli; Jiang, Kai; Chung, Brice; Ouchi, Takanari; Burke, Paul J.; Boysen, Dane A.; Bradwell, David J.; Kim, Hojong; Muecke, Ulrich; Sadoway, Donald R.] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Sadoway, DR (reprint author), MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dsadoway@mit.edu,"Wang, kangli/E-2789-2013",,Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (US Department of Energy); Total SA,We acknowledge financial support from the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (US Department of Energy) and Total SA.,,16,54,59,24,344,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Oct,2014,514,7522,,,,,348,+,,10.1038/nature13700,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AQ7JH,WOS:000342988600047,25252975,No,,,11/20/17

The environmental impacts of this development, from its effect on water quality(1) to the influence of increased methane leakage on climate(2), have been a matter of intense debate. Air quality impacts are associated with emissions of nitrogen oxides(3,4) (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds(5-7) (VOCs), whose photochemistry leads to production of ozone, a secondary pollutant with negative health effects(8). Recent observations in oil-and gas-producing basins in the western United States have identified ozone mixing ratios well in excess of present air quality standards, but only during winter(9-13). Understanding winter ozone production in these regions is scientifically challenging. It occurs during cold periods of snow cover when meteorological inversions concentrate air pollutants from oil and gas activities, but when solar irradiance and absolute humidity, which are both required to initiate conventional photochemistry essential for ozone production, are at a minimum. Here, using data from a remote location in the oil and gas basin of northeastern Utah and a box model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the photochemistry that leads to these extreme winter ozone pollution events, and identify key factors that control ozone production in this unique environment. We find that ozone production occurs at lower NOx and much larger VOC concentrations than does its summertime urban counterpart, leading to carbonyl (oxygenated VOCs with a C=O moiety) photolysis as a dominant oxidant source. Extreme VOC concentrations optimize the ozone production efficiency of NOx. There is considerable potential for global growth in oil and gas extraction from shale. This analysis could help inform strategies to monitor and mitigate air quality impacts and provide broader insight into the response of winter ozone to primary pollutants.","[Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Trainer, Michael K.; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Edwards, Peter M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Yuan, Bin] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Field, Robert A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Soltis, Jeffrey] Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Larmie, WY 82070 USA; [Flynn, James H.; Lefer, Barry L.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Helmig, Detlev; Thompson, Chelsea R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Li, Shao-Meng] Environm Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Stutz, Jochen; Tsai, Catalina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Brown, SS (reprint author), NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",steven.s.brown@noaa.gov,"; Edwards, Peter/H-5236-2013; Stutz, Jochen/K-7159-2014; Thompson, Chelsea/L-2302-2015; de Gouw, Joost/A-9675-2008; Brown, Steven/I-1762-2013; Gilman, Jessica/E-7751-2010; Wild, Robert/I-1963-2013; Manager, CSD Publications/B-2789-2015; Yuan, Bin/A-1223-2012; Banta, Robert/B-8361-2008; Lerner, Brian/H-6556-2013; Young, Cora/A-4551-2010; Langford, Andrew/D-2323-2009; Ahmadov, Ravan/F-2036-2011; Washenfelder, Rebecca/E-7169-2010; Warneke, Carsten/E-7174-2010; Roberts, James/A-1082-2009; Graus, Martin/E-7546-2010; Trainer, Michael/H-5168-2013; Veres, Patrick/E-7441-2010; Senff, Christoph/I-2592-2013; Parrish, David/E-8957-2010; Koss, Abigail/B-5421-2015","FIELD, ROBERT/0000-0003-0228-1419; Edwards, Peter/0000-0002-1076-6793; Thompson, Chelsea/0000-0002-7332-9945; de Gouw, Joost/0000-0002-0385-1826; Gilman, Jessica/0000-0002-7899-9948; Wild, Robert/0000-0002-4800-5172; Yuan, Bin/0000-0003-3041-0329; Lefer, Barry/0000-0001-9520-5495; Lerner, Brian/0000-0001-8721-8165; Young, Cora/0000-0002-6908-5829; Langford, Andrew/0000-0002-2932-7061; Ahmadov, Ravan/0000-0002-6996-7071; Washenfelder, Rebecca/0000-0002-8106-3702; Roberts, James/0000-0002-8485-8172; Graus, Martin/0000-0002-2025-9242; Veres, Patrick/0000-0001-7539-353X; Parrish, David/0000-0001-6312-2724; ","Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD); Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Utah State University; Western Energy Alliance; NOAA's Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Carbon Cycle programme; Questar Energy Products; National Science Foundation [1212666, 1215926]","The Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies were a joint project led and coordinated by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and supported by the Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Utah State University.

However, it is not known how the surface expression of the various geochemical components observed in hotspot volcanoes relates to their spatial distribution within the plume(4-10). Here we present a relationship between He and Pb isotopes in Samoan lavas that places severe constraints on the distribution of geochemical species within the plume. The Pb-isotopic compositions of the Samoan lavas reveal several distinct geochemical groups, each corresponding to a different geographic lineament of volcanoes. Each group has a signature associated with one of four mantle end members with low He-3/He-4:EMII(enriched mantle 2), EMI(enriched mantle 1), HIMU(high mu = U-238/Pb-204) and DM(depleted mantle). Critically, these four geochemical groups trend towards a common region of Pb-isotopic space with high He-3/He-4. This observation is consistent with several low-He-3/He-4 components in the plume mixing with a common high-He-3/He-4 component, but not mixing much with each other. The mixing relationships inferred from the new He and Pb isotopic data provide the clearest picture yet of the geochemical geometry of a mantle plume, and are best explained by a high-He-3/He-4 plume matrix that hosts, and mixes with, several distinct low-He-3/He-4 components.","[Jackson, M.

The socially polymorphic spider Anelosimus studiosus exhibits a behavioural polymorphism in which females exhibit either a 'docile' or 'aggressive' behavioural phenotype(3,4). Natural colonies are composed of a mixture of related docile and aggressive individuals, and populations differ in colonies' characteristic docile: aggressive ratios(5,6). Using experimentally constructed colonies of known composition, here we demonstrate that population-level divergence in docile: aggressive ratios is driven by site-specific selection at the group level-certain ratios yield high survivorship at some sites but not others. Our data also indicate that colonies responded to the risk of extinction: perturbed colonies tended to adjust their composition over two generations to match the ratio characteristic of their native site, thus promoting their long-term survival in their natal habitat. However, colonies of displaced individuals continued to shift their compositions towards mixtures that would have promoted their survival had they remained at their home sites, regardless of their contemporary environment. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms that colonies use to adjust their composition appear to be locally adapted. Our data provide experimental evidence of group selection driving collective traits in wild populations.","[Pruitt, Jonathan N.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Goodnight, Charles J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Pruitt, JN (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",pruittj@pitt.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1352705],"We are indebted to S.

Although lobopodians occupy a deep phylogenetic position within Panarthropoda, a shortage of derived characters obscures their evolutionary relationships with extant phyla (Onychophora, Tardigrada and Euarthropoda)(2,3,5,10-15). Here we describe a complex feature in the terminal claws of the mid-Cambrian lobopodian Hallucigenia sparsa-their construction from a stack of constituent elements-and demonstrate that equivalent elements make up the jaws and claws of extant Onychophora. A cladistic analysis, informed by developmental data on panarthropod head segmentation, indicates that the stacked sclerite components in these two taxa are homologous-resolving hallucigeniid lobopodians as stem-group onychophorans. The results indicate a sister-group relationship between Tardigrada and Euarthropoda, adding palaeontological support to the neurological(16,17) and musculoskeletal(18,19) evidence uniting these disparate clades.

Environmental water deficiency triggers an osmotic stress signalling cascade, which induces short-term cellular responses to reduce water loss and long-term responses to remodel the transcriptional network and physiological and developmental processes(1-4). Several signalling components that have been identified by extensive genetic screens for altered sensitivities to osmotic stress seem to function downstream of the perception of osmotic stress. It is known that hyperosmolality and various other stimuli trigger increases in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i))(5,6). Considering that in bacteria and animals osmosensing Ca2+ channels serve as osmosensors(7,8), hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+] i increases have been widely speculated to be involved in osmosensing in plants(1,9). However, the molecular nature of corresponding Ca2+ channels remain unclear(6,10,11). Here we describe a hyperosmolalitygated calcium-permeable channel and its function in osmosensing in plants. Using calcium-imaging-based unbiased forward genetic screens we isolated Arabidopsis mutants that exhibit low hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+](i) increases. These mutants were rescreened for their cellular, physiological and developmental responses to osmotic stress, and those with clear combined phenotypes were selected for further physical mapping. One of the mutants, reduced hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+](i) increase 1 (osca1), displays impaired osmotic Ca2+ signalling in guard cells and root cells, and attenuated water transpiration regulation and root growth in response to osmotic stress. OSCA1 is identified as a previously unknown plasma membrane protein and forms hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channels, revealing that OSCA1 may be an osmosensor. OSCA1 represents a channel responsible for [Ca2+](i) increases induced by a stimulus in plants, opening up new avenues for studying Ca2+ machineries for other stimuli and providing potential molecular genetic targets for engineering drought-resistant crops.","[Yuan, Fang; Yang, Huimin; Xue, Yan; Kong, Dongdong; Ye, Rui; Li, Chijun; Zhang, Jingyuan; Theprungsirikul, Lynn; Shrift, Tayler; Krichilsky, Bryan; He, Yikun; Siedow, James N.; Pei, Zhen-Ming] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Yuan, Fang; Zhang, Jingyuan] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Plant Environm Sensing, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Johnson, Douglas M.; Swift, Gary B.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Pei, ZM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",fangyuan@hznu.edu.cn; zpei@duke.edu,,"Pei, Zhen-Ming/0000-0003-1473-696X","Hangzhou Normal University [PanDeng11001008001]; Zhejiang NSF [Z3110433]; USDA [CSREES-2005-35304-16196, CSREES-2006-35100-17304]; NSF [MCB-0451072, IOS-0848263]","We thank M.

In the cytosol, the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I; encoded by DDX58) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; encoded by IFIH1) sense atypical RNAs associated with virus infection(1,2). Detection triggers a signalling cascade via the adaptor MAVS that culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFN-alpha and beta; hereafter IFN), which are key antiviral cytokines. RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by distinct viral RNA structures and much evidence indicates that RIG-I responds to RNAs bearing a triphosphate (ppp) moiety in conjunction with a blunt-ended, base-paired region at the 5'-end (reviewed in refs 1-3). Here we show that RIG-I also mediates antiviral responses to RNAs bearing 5'-diphosphates (5'pp). Genomes from mammalian reoviruses with 5'pp termini, 5'pp-RNA isolated from yeast L-A virus, and base-paired 5'pp-RNAs made by in vitro transcription or chemical synthesis, all bind to RIG-I and serve as RIG-I agonists. Furthermore, a RIG-I-dependent response to 5'pp-RNA is essential for controlling reovirus infection in cultured cells and in mice. Thus, the minimal determinant for RIG-I recognition is a base-paired RNA with 5'pp. Such RNAs are found in some viruses but not in uninfected cells, indicating that recognition of 5'pp-RNA, like that of 5'ppp-RNA, acts as a powerful means of self/non-self discrimination by the innate immune system.","[Goubau, Delphine; Deddouche, Safia; Van der Veen, Annemarthe G.; Rehwinkel, Jan; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Schlee, Martin; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Klin Chem, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Schlee, Martin; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Klin Pharmakol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Elizabeth B Lamb Ctr Pediat Res, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Fujimura, Tsutomu] Univ Salamanca, Inst Biol Func & Genom, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Goubau, D (reprint author), Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Immunobiol Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, England.",delphine.goubau@cancer.org.uk; caetano@cancer.org.uk,"Fujimura, Tsutomu/K-5807-2014; Ludwig, Janos/I-3544-2013","Fujimura, Tsutomu/0000-0002-9457-6769; Reis e Sousa, Caetano/0000-0001-7392-2119; Hartmann, Gunther/0000-0003-1021-2018","Cancer Research UK; European Research Council (ERC Advanced Researcher Grant) [AdG-2010-268670]; Public Health Service award [R37 AI038296]; Elizabeth B.

The inherent stochasticity of metabolic reaction events(4) should have negligible effect, because of averaging over the many reaction events contributing to growth. Indeed, metabolism and growth are often considered to be constant for fixed conditions(5,6). Stochastic fluctuations in the expression level(1,7-9) of metabolic enzymes could produce variations in the reactions they catalyse. However, whether such molecular fluctuations can affect growth is unclear, given the various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms(10-12), the slow adjustment of key cellular components such as ribosomes(13,14), and the secretion(15) and buffering(16,17) of excess metabolites. Here we use time-lapse microscopy to measure fluctuations in the instantaneous growth rate of single cells of Escherichia coli, and quantify time-resolved cross-correlations with the expression of lac genes and enzymes in central metabolism. We show that expression fluctuations of catabolically active enzymes can propagate and cause growth fluctuations, with transmission depending on the limitation of the enzyme to growth. Conversely, growth fluctuations propagate back to perturb expression. Accordingly, enzymes were found to transmit noise to other unrelated genes via growth. Homeostasis is promoted by a noise-cancelling mechanism that exploits fluctuations in the dilution of proteins by cell-volume expansion. The results indicate that molecular noise is propagated not only by regulatory proteins(18,19) but also by metabolic reactions. They also suggest that cellular metabolism is inherently stochastic, and a generic source of phenotypic heterogeneity.","[Kiviet, Daniel J.; Nghe, Philippe; Walker, Noreen; Boulineau, Sarah; Sunderlikova, Vanda; Tans, Sander J.] FOM Inst AMOLF, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kiviet, Daniel J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kiviet, Daniel J.] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland","Tans, SJ (reprint author), FOM Inst AMOLF, Sci Pk 104, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",kiviet@env.ethz.ch; tans@amolf.nl,"Nghe, Philippe/M-3065-2015","Nghe, Philippe/0000-0003-3690-4610",ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship,"Work in the laboratory of S.J.T. is part of the research programme of the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM), which is part of the Netherlands Organisationfor Scientific Research(NWO).

Here we describe a new method of cancer model generation using the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system in vivo in wild-type mice. We used hydrodynamic injection to deliver a CRISPR plasmid DNA expressing Cas9 and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)(2-4) to the liver that directly target the tumour suppressor genes Pten (ref. 5) and p53 (also known as TP53 and Trp53) (ref. 6), alone and in combination. CRISPR-mediated Pten mutation led to elevated Akt phosphorylation and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, phenocopying the effects of deletion of the gene using Cre-LoxP technology(7,8). Simultaneous targeting of Pten and p53 induced liver tumours that mimicked those caused by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of Pten and p53. DNA sequencing of liver and tumour tissue revealed insertion or deletion mutations of the tumour suppressor genes, including bi-allelic mutations of both Pten and p53 in tumours. Furthermore, co-injection of Cas9 plasmids harbouring sgRNAs targeting the beta-catenin gene and a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide donor carrying activating point mutations led to the generation of hepatocytes with nuclear localization of b-catenin. This study demonstrates the feasibility of direct mutation of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in the liver using the CRISPR/Cas system, which presents a new avenue for rapid development of liver cancer models and functional genomics.","[Xue, Wen; Chen, Sidi; Yin, Hao; Tammela, Tuomas; Papagiannakopoulos, Thales; Joshi, Nikhil S.; Cai, Wenxin; Yang, Gillian; Crowley, Denise G.; Anderson, Daniel G.; Sharp, Phillip A.; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Bronson, Roderick] Tufts Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bronson, Roderick] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Feng] MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Zhang, Feng] Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Anderson, Daniel G.] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Anderson, Daniel G.] Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Anderson, Daniel G.] MIT, Inst Med Engn & Sci, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sharp, Phillip A.; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Jacks, T (reprint author), MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",tjacks@mit.edu,,"/0000-0003-3675-6961; Joshi, Nikhil/0000-0002-7045-7837","National Institutes of Health [2-PO1-CA42063, RO1-EB000244, RO1-CA115527, RO1-CA132091]; Cancer Center Support (core) grant from the National Cancer Institute [P30-CA14051]; NIH [R01-CA133404]; Casimir-Lambert Fund; NIH Centers for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence [5-U54-CA151884-04]; Harvard-MIT Center of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence; American Association for Cancer Research; Leukemia Lymphoma Society;  [1K99CA169512]","We thank D.

Although Rb has diverse tumour-suppressor functions and is inactivated in many cancers(1-5), germline RB1 mutations predispose to retinoblastoma far more strongly than to other malignancies(6). This tropism suggests that retinal cell-type-specific circuitry sensitizes to Rb loss, yet the nature of the circuitry and the cell type in which it operates have beenunclear(7,8). Here we show that post-mitotic human cone precursors are uniquely sensitive to Rb depletion. Rb knockdown induced cone precursor proliferation in prospectively isolated populations and in intact retina. Proliferation followed the induction of E2F-regulated genes, and depended on factors having strong expression in maturing cone precursors and crucial roles in retinoblastoma cell proliferation, including MYCN and MDM2. Proliferation of Rb-depleted cones and retinoblastoma cells also depended on the Rb-related protein p107, SKP2, and a p27 downregulation associated with cone precursor maturation. Moreover, Rb-depleted cone precursors formed tumours in orthotopic xenografts with histological features and protein expression typical of human retinoblastoma. These findings provide a compelling molecular rationale for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma. More generally, they demonstrate that cell-type-specific circuitry can collaborate with an initiating oncogenic mutation to enable tumorigenesis.","[Xu, Xiaoliang L.; Wang, Lu; Jhanwar, Suresh C.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Xu, Xiaoliang L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst Canc Res, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Singh, Hardeep P.; Qi, Dong-Lai; Cobrinik, David] Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Div Ophthalmol, Dept Surg, Vis Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA; [Singh, Hardeep P.; Qi, Dong-Lai; Cobrinik, David] Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Saban Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA; [Poulos, Bradford K.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Abramson, David H.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ophthalm Oncol Serv, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Jhanwar, Suresh C.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Cobrinik, David] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, USC Eye Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Cobrinik, David] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Norris Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA","Jhanwar, SC (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",jhanwars@mskcc.org; dcobrinik@chla.usc.edu,,"Singh, Hardeep/0000-0002-9586-8544",Gerber Foundation; Fund for Ophthalmic Knowledge; Research and Development Funds of the MSKCC Department of Pathology; Larry & Celia Moh Foundation; National Institutes of Health [1R01CA137124],"We thank P.

The 11-subunit RNA exosome complex is the main source of cellular 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity and potentially regulates the mammalian noncoding transcriptome(1). Here we generated a mouse model in which the essential subunit Exosc3 of the RNA exosome complex can be conditionally deleted. Exosc3-deficient B cells lack the ability to undergo normal levels of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, two mutagenic DNA processes used to generate antibody diversity via the B-cell mutator protein activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)(2,3). The transcriptome of Exosc3-deficient B cells has revealed the presence of many novel RNA exosome substrate ncRNAs. RNA exosome substrate RNAs include xTSS-RNAs, transcription start site (TSS)-associated antisense transcripts that can exceed 500 base pairs in length and are transcribed divergently from cognate coding gene transcripts. xTSS-RNAs are most strongly expressed at genes that accumulate AID mediated somatic mutations and/or are frequent translocation partners of DNA double-strand breaks generated at Igh in B cells(4,5). Strikingly, translocations near TSSs or within gene bodies occur over regions of RNA exosome substrate ncRNA expression. These RNA exosome-regulated, antisense-transcribed regions of the B-cell genome recruit AID and accumulate single-strand DNA structures containing RNA-DNA hybrids. We propose that RNA exosome regulation of ncRNA recruits AID to single-strand DNA-forming sites of antisense and divergent transcription in the B-cell genome, thereby creating a link between ncRNA transcription and overall maintenance of B-cell genomic integrity.","[Pefanis, Evangelos; Wang, Jiguang; Rothschild, Gerson; Lim, Junghyun; Chao, Jaime; Basu, Uttiya] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Pefanis, Evangelos; Economides, Aris N.] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Wang, Jiguang; Rabadan, Raul] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Syst Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Wang, Jiguang; Rabadan, Raul] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Rabadan, R (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",rr2579@columbia.edu; ub2121@columbia.edu,"Wang, Jiguang/B-2717-2012","Economides, Aris/0000-0002-6508-8942","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1DP2OD008651-01]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [1R01AI099195-01A1]; NIH [1R01CA185486-01, 1R01CA179044-01A1, 1U54CA121852-05]","We thank L.

These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon faecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects.

Caspase-11 activation-induced pyroptosis, in response to cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is critical for endotoxic shock in mice. The mechanism underlying cytosolic LPS sensing and the responsible pattern recognition receptor are unknown. Here we show that human monocytes, epithelial cells and keratinocytes undergo necrosis upon cytoplasmic delivery of LPS. LPS-induced cytotoxicity was mediated by human caspase-4 that could functionally complement murine caspase-11. Human caspase-4 and the mouse homologue caspase-11 (hereafter referred to as caspase-4/11) and also human caspase-5, directly bound to LPS and lipid A with high specificity and affinity. LPS associated with endogenous caspase-11 in pyroptotic cells. Insect-cell purified caspase-4/11 underwent oligomerization upon LPS binding, resulting in activation of the caspases. Underacylated lipid IVa and lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) could bind to caspase-4/11 but failed to induce their oligomerization and activation. LPS binding was mediated by the CARD domain of the caspase. Binding-deficient CARD-domain point mutants did not respond to LPS with oligomerization or activation and failed to induce pyroptosis upon LPS electroporation or bacterial infections. The function of caspase-4/5/11 represents a new mode of pattern recognition in immunity and also an unprecedented means of caspase activation.","[Shi, Jianjin; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Peking Univ Tsinghua Univ Natl Inst Biol Sci Join, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jianjin; Zhao, Yue; Wang, Yupeng; Gao, Wenqing; Ding, Jingjin; Li, Peng; Hu, Liyan; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jingjin; Shao, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Canc Med, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Shao, F (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Peking Univ Tsinghua Univ Natl Inst Biol Sci Join, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",shaofeng@nibs.ac.cn,,"Shi, Jianjin/0000-0001-8048-5180",International Early Career Scientist grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Beijing Scholar Program; National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program [2012CB518700]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB08020202]; China National Science Foundation Program for Distinguished Young Scholars [31225002],"We thank Y.

The lariat is important for the fidelity of 5' splice-site selection and consists of a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond between a bulged adenosine and the 5' end of the intron. To gain insight into this ubiquitous intramolecular linkage, we determined the crystal structure of a eukaryotic group IIB intron in the lariat form at 3.7 angstrom. This revealed that two tandem tetraloop-receptor interactions, eta-eta' and pi-pi', place domain VI in the core to position the lariat bond in the post-catalytic state. On the basis of structural and biochemical data, we propose that pi-pi' is a dynamic interaction that mediates the transition between the two steps of splicing, with pi-pi' serving an ancillary role. The structure also reveals a four-magnesium-ion cluster involved in both catalysis and positioning of the 5' end. Given the evolutionary relationship between group II and nuclear introns, it is likely that this active site configuration exists in the spliceosome as well.","[Robart, Aaron R.; Chan, Russell T.; Peters, Jessica K.; Toor, Navtej] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, NE CAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Toor, N (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ntoor@ucsd.edu,,,"Cell, Molecular, and Genetics Training Program - NIH predoctoral training grant [5T32GM007240]; UCSD Molecular Biophysics Training Program - NIH predoctoral training grant [5T32GM008326]; NIH grant [8P41GM103403-10]; US DOE [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Hellman Foundation Fellowship; NIH [5R01GM102216]","We thank S.

They have luminosities of more than 3 x 10(39) ergs per second, unusually soft X-ray components (with a typical temperature of less than about 0.3 kiloelectronvolts) and a characteristic downturn(2,3) in their spectra above about 5 kiloelectronvolts. Such puzzling properties have been interpreted either as evidence of intermediate-mass black holes(4,5) or as emission from stellar-mass black holes accreting above their Eddington limit(6,7), analogous to some Galactic black holes at peak luminosity(8,9). Recently, a very soft X-ray spectrum was observed in a rare and transient stellar-mass black hole(10). Here we report that the X-ray source P13 in the galaxy NGC 7793(11) is in a binary system with a period of about 64 days and exhibits all three canonical properties of ultraluminous sources. By modelling the strong optical and ultraviolet modulations arising from X-ray heating of the B9Ia donor star, we constrain the black hole mass to be less than 15 solar masses. Our results demonstrate that in P13, soft thermal emission and spectral curvature are indeed signatures of supercritical accretion. By analogy, ultraluminous X-ray sources with similar X-ray spectra and luminosities of up to a few times 10(40) ergs per second can be explained by supercritical accretion onto massive stellar-mass black holes.","[Motch, C.; Pakull, M.

Their X-ray luminosities in the 0.5-10 kiloelectronvolt energy band range from 10(39) to 10(41) ergs per second(3). Because higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the isotropic Eddington limit, theoretical models have focused on black hole rather than neutron star systems(1,2). The most challenging sources to explain are those at the luminous end of the range (more than 10(40) ergs per second), which require black hole masses of 50-100 times the solar value or significant departures from the standard thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries, or both. Here we report broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M82 that reveal pulsations with an average period of 1.37 seconds and a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to an X-ray luminosity in the 3-30 kiloelectronvolt range of 4.9 x 10(39) ergs per second. The pulsating source is spatially coincident with a variable source(4) that can reach an X-ray luminosity in the 0.3-10 kiloelectronvolt range of 1.8 x 10(40) ergs per second(1). This association implies a luminosity of about 100 times the Eddington limit for a 1.4-solar-mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any known accreting pulsar. This implies that neutron stars may not be rare in the ultraluminous X-ray population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion of matter onto magnetized compact objects.","[Bachetti, M.; Barret, D.; Webb, N.

Here we report the observation of an extremely large positive magnetoresistance at low temperatures in the non-magnetic layered transition-metal dichalcogenide WTe2: 452,700 per cent at 4.5 kelvins in a magnetic field of 14.7 teslas, and 13 million per cent at 0.53 kelvins in a magnetic field of 60 teslas. In contrast with other materials, there is no saturation of the magnetoresistance value even at very high applied fields.

The spatial resolution of these spectroscopies is typically one micrometre or more, although it can reach a few tens of nanometres or even a few a angstroms when enhanced by the presence of a sharp metallic tip(6,7). If vibrational spectroscopy could be combined with the spatial resolution and flexibility of the transmission electron microscope, it would open up the study of vibrational modes in many different types of nanostructures. Unfortunately, the energy resolution of electron energy loss spectroscopy performed in the electron microscope has until now been too poor to allow such a combination. Recent developments that have improved the attainable energy resolution of electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to around ten millielectronvolts now allow vibrational spectroscopy to be carried out in the electron microscope. Here we describe the innovations responsible for the progress, and present examples of applications in inorganic and organic materials, including the detection of hydrogen. We also demonstrate that the vibrational signal has both high-and low-spatial-resolution components, that the first component can be used to map vibrational features at nanometre-level resolution, and that the second component can be used for analysis carried out with the beam positioned just outside the sample-that is, for 'aloof' spectroscopy that largely avoids radiation damage.","[Krivanek, Ondrej L.; Lovejoy, Tracy C.; Dellby, Niklas] Nion Co, Kirkland, WA 98033 USA; [Krivanek, Ondrej L.; Rez, Peter] Arizona State Univ, Dept Phys, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Aoki, Toshihiro; Soignard, Emmanuel; Zhu, Jiangtao] Arizona State Univ, LeRoy Eyring Ctr Solid State Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Carpenter, R.

The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type(3-6). Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(4)(+7) years (95 per cent confidence interval). Onaverage, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75 degrees north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semiarid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.","[Carvalhais, Nuno; Forkel, Matthias; Khomik, Myroslava; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Thurner, Martin; Weber, Ulrich; Ahrens, Bernhard; Beer, Christian; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, DCEA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Khomik, Myroslava] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Univ Milano Bicocca, DISAT, Remote Sensing Environm Dynam Lab, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Mu, Mingquan; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Santoro, Maurizio] Gamma Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Cescatti, Alessandro] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Climate Risk Management Unit, I-21027 Ispra, Italy","Carvalhais, N (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",nuno.carvalhais@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Beer, Christian/D-2296-2013; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Thurner, Martin/K-4854-2017","Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Thurner, Martin/0000-0003-2362-5161",European Union (FP7) through the project GEOCARBON [283080]; ERC starting grant QUASOM [ERC-2007-StG-208516]; European Union (FP7) through the project CARBONES [242316]; European Union (FP7) through the project EMBRACE [283201],"We would like to thank C.

In China, particulate pollution is a serious environmental problem that is influencing air quality, regional and global climates, and human health(2,3). In response to the extremely severe and persistent haze pollution experienced by about 800 million people during the first quarter of 2013 (refs 4, 5), the Chinese State Council announced its aim to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) by up to 25 per cent relative to 2012 levels by 2017 (ref. 6). Such efforts however require elucidation of the factors governing the abundance and composition of PM2.5, which remain poorly constrained in China(3,7,8). Here we combine a comprehensive set of novel and state-of-the-art offline analytical approaches and statistical techniques to investigate the chemical nature and sources of particulate matter at urban locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an during January 2013. We find that the severe haze pollution event was driven to a large extent by secondary aerosol formation, which contributed 30-77 per cent and 44-71 per cent (average for all four cities) of PM2.5 and of organic aerosol, respectively. On average, the contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) are found to be of similar importance (SOA/SIA ratios range from 0.6 to 1.4). Our results suggest that, in addition to mitigating primary particulate emissions, reducing the emissions of secondary aerosol precursors from, for example, fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning is likely to be important for controlling China's PM2.5 levels and for reducing the environmental, economic and health impacts resulting from particulate pollution.","[Huang, Ru-Jin; Bozzetti, Carlo; Daellenbach, Kaspar R.; Slowik, Jay G.; Platt, Stephen M.; Canonaco, Francesco; Zotter, Peter; Wolf, Robert; Pieber, Simone M.; Bruns, Emily A.; Crippa, Monica; Ciarelli, Giancarlo; Baltensperger, Urs; El Haddad, Imad; Prevot, Andre S.

Here, using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art(11). The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. In addition, a painting of a babirusa ('pig-deer') made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one. Among the implications, it can now be demonstrated that humans were producing rock art by similar to 40 kyr ago at opposite ends of the Pleistocene Eurasian world.","[Aubert, M.; Brumm, A.; Sutikna, T.; van den Bergh, G.

Despite 70-90% of CHARGE syndrome cases resulting from mutations in the gene CHD7, which encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller, the pathways underlying the diverse phenotypes remain poorly understood(2). Surprisingly, our studies of a knock-in mutant mouse strain that expresses a stabilized and transcriptionally dead variant of the tumour-suppressor protein p53 (p53(25,26,53,54))(3), along with a wild-type allele ofp53 (also known as Trp53), revealed late-gestational embryonic lethality associated with a host of phenotypes that are characteristic of CHARGE syndrome, including coloboma, inner and outer ear malformations, heart outflow tract defects and craniofacial defects. We found that the p53(25,26,53,54) mutant protein stabilized and hyperactivated wildtype p53, which then inappropriately induced its target genes and triggered cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis during development. Importantly, these phenotypes were only observed with a wild-type p53 allele, as p53(25,26,53,54/-) embryos were fully viable. Furthermore, we found that CHD7 can bind to the p53 promoter, thereby negatively regu-lating p53 expression, and that CHD7 loss in mouse neural crest cells or samples from patients with CHARGE syndrome results in p53 activation. Strikingly, we found that p53 heterozygosity partially rescued the phenotypes in Chd7-null mouse embryos, demonstrating that p53 contributes to the phenotypes that result from CHD7 loss. Thus, inappropriate p53 activation during development can promote CHARGE phenotypes, supporting the idea that p53 has a critical role in developmental syndromes and providing important insight into the mechanisms underlying CHARGE syndrome.","[Van Nostrand, Jeanine L.; Brady, Colleen A.; Jung, Heiyoun; Kozak, Margaret M.; Johnson, Thomas M.; Attardi, Laura D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Div Radiat & Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fuentes, Daniel R.; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lin, Chieh-Yu; Vogel, Hannes] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lin, Chien-Jung; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Swiderski, Donald L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bernstein, Jonathan A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Attie-Bitach, Tania] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, APHP, Dept Genet, F-75015 Paris, France; [Attie-Bitach, Tania] Univ Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Imagine, Unite INSERM U1163, F-75015 Paris, France; [Chang, Ching-Pin] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Krannert Inst Cardiol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Martin, Donna M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Martin, Donna M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Attardi, Laura D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Attardi, LD (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Div Radiat & Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",attardi@stanford.edu,"ATTIE-BITACH, Tania/K-1453-2017","ATTIE-BITACH, Tania/0000-0002-1155-3626; Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-0412-6933; Van Nostrand, Jeanine/0000-0003-1363-9527","NSF; NCI [1F31CA167917-01]; NIH [RO1 GM095555, R01 HL118087, RO1 HL121197, R01 DC009410, RO1 CA140875]; American Heart Association [12EIA8960018]; March of Dimes Foundation [6-FY11-260]; ACS; LLS","We thank S.

In the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, some intrinsic factors promote germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal, whereas others stimulate differentiation(3). However, it remains poorly understood how the balance between self-renewal and differentiation is controlled. Here we use D. mel-anogaster ovarian GSCs to demonstrate that the differentiation factor Bam controls the functional switch of the COP9 complex from self-renewal to differentiation via protein competition. The COP9 complex is composed of eight Csn subunits, Csn1-8, and removes Nedd8 modifications from target proteins(4,5). Genetic results indicated that the COP9 complex is required intrinsically for GSC self-renewal, whereas other Csn proteins, with the exception of Csn4, were also required for GSC progeny differentiation. Bam-mediated Csn4 sequestration from the COP9 complex via protein competition inactivated the self-renewing function of COP9 and allowed other Csn proteins to promote GSC differentiation. Therefore, this study reveals a protein-competition-based mechanism for controlling the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Because numerous self-renewal factors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the stem cell lineage in various systems, protein competition may function as an important mechanism for controlling the self-renewal-to-differentiation switch.","[Pan, Lei; Wang, Su; Weng, Changjiang; Song, Xiaoqing; Yu, Junjing; Xie, Ting] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Pan, Lei; Yu, Junjing; Tang, Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Infect & Immun, Inst Biophys, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Su; Xie, Ting] Univ Kansas, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Lu, Tinglin; Sun, Jin; Yang, Zhi-Hao; Ni, Jianquan] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Park, Joseph K.; McKearin, Dennis M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Park, Joseph K.; McKearin, Dennis M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Park, Joseph K.; McKearin, Dennis M.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Chamovitz, Daniel A.] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Plant Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Xie, T (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, 1000 East 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",tgx@stowers.org,,"Chamovitz, Daniel/0000-0002-2815-2909",Stowers Institute for Medical Research; National Institutes of Health [GM64428]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370909]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2012CB518900],"We thank Y.

Defects in preserving the integrity of the mucosal barriers can result in systemic endotoxaemia that contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation, which further promotes the development ofmetabolic syndrome(3-5). Interleukin (IL)-22 exerts essential roles in eliciting antimicrobial immunity and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity within the intestine(6,7). Here we investigate the connection between IL-22 and metabolic disorders. We find that the induction of IL-22 from innate lymphoid cells and CD4(+) T cells is impaired in obese mice under various immune challenges, especially in the colon during infection with Citrobacter rodentium. While innate lymphoid cell populations are largely intact in obese mice, the upregulation of IL-23, a cytokine upstream of IL-22, is compromised during the infection. Consequently, these mice are susceptible to C. rodentium infection, and both exogenous IL-22 and IL-23 are able to restore the mucosal host defence. Importantly, we further unveil unexpected functions of IL-22 in regulating metabolism. Mice deficient in IL-22 receptor and fed with high-fat diet are prone to developing metabolic disorders. Strikingly, administration of exogenous IL-22 in genetically obese leptin-receptor-deficient (db/db) mice and mice fed with high-fat diet reverses many of the metabolic symptoms, including hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. IL-22 shows diverse metabolic benefits, as it improves insulin sensitivity, preserves gut mucosal barrier and endocrine functions, decreases endotoxaemia and chronic inflammation, and regulates lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. In summary, we identify the IL-22 pathway as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases.","[Wang, Xiaoting; Ota, Naruhisa; Manzanillo, Paolo; Eidenschenk, Celine; Zhang, Juan; Lesch, Justin; Lee, Wyne P.; Ouyang, Wenjun] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Kates, Lance; Zavala-Solorio, Jose; Ross, Jed; van Bruggen, Nicholas; Kolumam, Ganesh] Genentech Inc, Dept Biomed Imaging, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Diehl, Lauri] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ouyang, WJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",kolumam@gene.com; ouyang@gene.com,,"Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864",,,,37,80,82,7,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Oct,2014,514,7521,,,,,237,+,,10.1038/nature13564,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AQ3BG,WOS:000342663100044,25119041,No,,,11/20/17

Despite extensive knowledge of the molecular defects causing beta-TM, little is known of the mechanisms responsible for the ineffective erythropoiesis observed in the condition, which is characterized by accelerated erythroid differentiation, maturation arrest and apoptosis at the polychromatophilic stage(3-6). We have previously demonstrated that normal human erythroid maturation requires a transient activation of caspase-3 at the later stages of maturation(7). Although erythroid transcription factor GATA-1, themaster transcriptional factor of erythropoiesis, is a caspase-3 target, it is not cleaved during erythroid differentiation. We have shown that, in human erythroblasts, the chaperone heat shock protein70 (HSP70) is constitutively expressed and, at later stages of maturation, translocates into the nucleus and protects GATA-1 from caspase-3 cleavage(8). The primary role of this ubiquitous chaperone is to participate in the refolding of proteins denatured by cytoplasmic stress, thus preventing their aggregation(9). Here we show in vitro that during the maturation of human beta-TM erythroblasts, HSP70 interacts directly with free alpha-globin chains. As a consequence, HSP70 is sequestrated in the cytoplasm and GATA-1 is no longer protected, resulting in end-stage maturation arrest and apoptosis. Transduction of a nuclear-targeted HSP70 mutant or a caspase-3-uncleavable GATA-1 mutant restores terminal maturation of beta-TM erythroblasts, which may provide a rationale for new targeted therapies of beta-TM.","[Arlet, Jean-Benoit; Ribeil, Jean-Antoine; Guillem, Flavia; Dussiot, Michael; Moura, Ivan Cruz; Belaid-Choucair, Zakia; Maciel, Thiago Trovati; Hermine, Olivier; Courtois, Genevieve] Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS Equipe Rech Labellisee, UMR 1163, Lab INSERM, F-75015 Paris, France; [Arlet, Jean-Benoit] Hop Europeen Georges Pompidou, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Med Paris Descartes, Serv Med Interne, F-75908 Paris, France; [Arlet, Jean-Benoit] Hop Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP HP, F-75908 Paris, France; [Arlet, Jean-Benoit; Ribeil, Jean-Antoine; Guillem, Flavia; Dussiot, Michael; Moura, Ivan Cruz; Belaid-Choucair, Zakia; Maciel, Thiago Trovati; Hermine, Olivier; Courtois, Genevieve] Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite Univ, Hop Necker, AP HP, Imagine Inst, F-75015 Paris, France; [Arlet, Jean-Benoit; Ribeil, Jean-Antoine; Guillem, Flavia; Dussiot, Michael; Moura, Ivan Cruz; Belaid-Choucair, Zakia; Maciel, Thiago Trovati; Fontenay, Michaela; Hermine, Olivier; Courtois, Genevieve] Lab Excellence GR Ex, F-75015 Paris, France; [Ribeil, Jean-Antoine] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Med Paris Descartes, Dept Biotherapie, F-75015 Paris, France; [Ribeil, Jean-Antoine] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, AP HP, F-75015 Paris, France; [Negre, Olivier; Beuzard, Yves; Leboulch, Philippe; Chretien, Stany] CEA, Inst Emerging Dis & Innovat Therapies iMETI, F-92260 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Hazoume, Adonis; Marcion, Guillaume; Sevin, Margaux; Garrido, Carmen] INSERM, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Canc, UMR 866, F-21033 Dijon, France; [Hazoume, Adonis; Marcion, Guillaume; Sevin, Margaux; Garrido, Carmen] Assoc Rech Canc, F-21033 Dijon, France; [Hazoume, Adonis; Marcion, Guillaume; Sevin, Margaux; Garrido, Carmen] Lab Excellence Lipoprot & Sante LipSTIC, F-21033 Dijon, France; [Hazoume, Adonis; Marcion, Guillaume; Sevin, Margaux; Seigneuric, Renaud; Garrido, Carmen] Univ Burgundy, Fac Med & Pharm, F-21033 Dijon, France; [Dussiot, Michael; Moura, Ivan Cruz; Maciel, Thiago Trovati] Hop Bichat Claude Bernard, INSERM, UMR 699, F-75018 Paris, France; [Moura, Ivan Cruz; Maciel, Thiago Trovati] Univ Paris 06, F-75013 Paris, France; [Moura, Ivan Cruz; Maciel, Thiago Trovati] Univ Paris 07, F-75013 Paris, France; [Demarest, Samuel; de Beauchene, Isaure Chauvot; Auclair, Christian; Tchertanov, Luba] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 8113, F-94230 Cachan, France; [de Beauchene, Isaure Chauvot; Auclair, Christian; Tchertanov, Luba] LERMIT, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Leboulch, Philippe] Womens Hosp Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Leboulch, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Baudin-Creuza, Veronique] Univ Paris 11, INSERM, UMR 779, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Fontenay, Michaela] Univ Paris 05, CNRS, INSERM, Inst Cochin,UMR 1016,UMR 8104, F-75014 Paris, France; [Fontenay, Michaela] Hop Cochin, Hop Univ Paris Ctr, AP HP, Serv Hematol Biol, F-75014 Paris, France; [Garrido, Carmen] Ctr Anticanc George Francois Leclerc, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Hermine, Olivier] Fac Med Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Serv Hematol, F-75015 Paris, France; [Hermine, Olivier] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, AP HP, F-75015 Paris, France","Hermine, O (reprint author), Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS Equipe Rech Labellisee, UMR 1163, Lab INSERM, 24 Blvd Montparnasse, F-75015 Paris, France.",ohermine@gmail.com; genevieve_courtois@yahoo.fr,"Arlet, Jean Benoit/D-3124-2016; Ribeil, Jean-Antoine/F-7896-2017; Maciel, Thiago/A-4475-2013; BAUDIN-CREUZA, Veronique/K-7309-2017","Ribeil, Jean-Antoine/0000-0002-5733-9123; Maciel, Thiago/0000-0002-9347-981X; BAUDIN-CREUZA, Veronique/0000-0003-1032-3236; Marcion, Guillaume/0000-0002-3634-6316","Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI); Societe Francaise d'Hematologie (SFH); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Assistance publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) (poste d'accueil APHP-CNRS); Groupe Pasteur Mutualite; Institut FARMAN (ENS de Cachan); ENS de Cachan; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne; l'Institut National du Cancer, INCa; National Research Agency under the 'Investments for the Future' program [ANR-10-IAHU-01]; Ligue nationale contre le cancer; Fondation pour la recherche medicale (FRM); Fondation de France; French National Research Agency [ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02]","J.-B.A. was a recipient of grants from the Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI), Societe Francaise d'Hematologie (SFH), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and Assistance publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) (poste d'accueil APHP-CNRS), and from Groupe Pasteur Mutualite.

However, loss-of-function mutations in PRC2 components occur in a subset of haematopoietic malignancies, suggesting that this complex plays a dichotomous and poorly understood role in cancer(2,3). Here we provide genomic, cellular, and mouse modelling data demonstrating that the polycomb group gene SUZ12 functions as tumour suppressor in PNS tumours, high-grade gliomas and melanomas by cooperating with mutations in NF1. NF1 encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and its loss drives cancer by activating Ras(4). We show that SUZ12 loss potentiates the effects of NF1 mutations by amplifying Ras-driven transcription through effects on chromatin. Importantly, however, SUZ12 inactivation also triggers an epigenetic switch that sensitizes these cancers to bromodomain inhibitors. Collectively, these studies not only reveal an unexpected connection between the PRC2 complex, NF1 and Ras, but also identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be exploited for a variety of cancers.","[De Raedt, Thomas; Cichowski, Karen] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Raedt, Thomas; Bradner, James; Cichowski, Karen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Raedt, Thomas; Cichowski, Karen] Dana Farber Harvard Canc Ctr, Ludwig Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Beert, Eline; Brems, Hilde; Legius, Eric] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Human Genet, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Pasmant, Eric; Luscan, Armelle; Ortonne, Nicolas; Vidaud, Michel] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Sci Pharmaceut & Biol, INSERM UMR S745, F-75006 Paris, France; [Pasmant, Eric; Luscan, Armelle; Ortonne, Nicolas; Vidaud, Michel] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Sci Pharmaceut & Biol, EA7331, F-75006 Paris, France; [Pasmant, Eric; Luscan, Armelle; Ortonne, Nicolas; Vidaud, Michel] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Serv Biochim & Genet Mol, F-75014 Paris, France; [Helin, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, BRIC, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Helin, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Epigenet, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Helin, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, Danish Stem Cell Ctr Danstem, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hornick, Jason L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mautner, Victor] Univ Med Ctr, Dept Maxillofacial Surg, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Kehrer-Sawatzki, Hildegard] Univ Ulm, Inst Human Genet, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Clapp, Wade] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Herman Wells Ctr Pediat Res, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Bradner, James] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Upadhyaya, Meena] Cardiff Univ, Inst Med Genet, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Legius, Eric] Univ Hosp Leuven, Ctr Human Genet, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium","Cichowski, K (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Eric.Legius@uzleuven.be; kcichowski@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Pasmant, Eric/O-7249-2017; Vidaud, Michel/O-7346-2017; Luscan, Armelle/O-8081-2017","Pasmant, Eric/0000-0002-1881-8762; Hornick, Jason/0000-0001-6475-8345; Helin, Kristian/0000-0003-1975-6097",US Department of Defense [W81XWH-11-1-0138]; Ludwig Center at DF/HCC and the Children's Tumor Foundation; Children's Tumor Foundation; FWO-Flanders [G.0784.10N]; Emmanuel Vanderschueren Fellowship from the Vlaamse Liga tegen Kanker,"This work was supported by the following organizations: The US Department of Defense (W81XWH-11-1-0138), the Ludwig Center at DF/HCC and the Children's Tumor Foundation (K.C.); T.D. was a recipient of the Young Investigator Award of the Children's Tumor Foundation; FWO-Flanders G.0784.10N (E.L.).

Lin28 is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells and has a fundamental role in regulation of development(5), glucose metabolism(6) and tissue regeneration(7). Over-expression of Lin28 is correlated with the onset of numerous cancers(8), whereas let-7, a tumour suppressor, silences several human oncogenes(5). Lin28 binds to precursor let-7 (pre-let-7) hairpins(9), triggering the 39 oligo-uridylation activity of TUT4 and TUT7 (refs 10-12). The oligoU tail added to pre-let-7 serves as a decay signal, as it is rapidly degraded by Dis3l2 (refs 13, 14), a homologue of the catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome. The molecular basis of Lin28-mediated recruitment of TUT4 and TUT7 to pre-let-7 and its subsequent degradation by Dis3l2 is largely unknown. To examine the mechanism of Dis3l2 substrate recognition we determined the structure of mouse Dis3l2 in complex with an oligoU RNA to mimic the uridylated tail of pre-let-7. Three RNA-binding domains form an open funnel on one face of the catalytic domain that allows RNA to navigate a path to the active site different from that of its exosome counterpart. The resulting path reveals an extensive network of uracil-specific interactions spanning the first 12 nucleotides of an oligoU-tailed RNA. We identify three U-specificity zones that explain how Dis3l2 recognizes, binds and processes uridylated pre-let-7 in the final step of the Lin28-let-7 pathway.","[Faehnle, Christopher R.; Walleshauser, Jack; Joshua-Tor, Leemor] WM Keck Struct Biol Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Faehnle, Christopher R.; Walleshauser, Jack; Joshua-Tor, Leemor] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Walleshauser, Jack; Joshua-Tor, Leemor] Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Joshua-Tor, Leemor] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Joshua-Tor, L (reprint author), WM Keck Struct Biol Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",leemor@cshl.edu,,,Watson School of Biological Sciences; Louis Morin Charitable Trust; Robertson Research Fund of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,"We thank C.

Here investigation of a developmentally required POU-homeodomain transcription factor, Pit1 (also known as Pou1f1), has revealed that, unexpectedly, binding of Pit1-occupied enhancers(5) to a nuclear matrin-3-rich network/architecture(6,7) is a key event in effective activation of the Pit1-regulated enhancer/coding gene transcriptional program. Pit1 association with Satb1 (ref. 8) and beta-catenin is required for this tethering event. A naturally occurring, dominant negative, point mutation in human PIT1(R271W), causing combined pituitary hormone deficiency(9), results in loss of Pit1 association with beta-catenin and Satb1 and therefore the matrin-3-rich network, blocking Pit1-dependent enhancer/coding target gene activation. This defective activation can be rescued by artificial tethering of the mutant R271W Pit1 protein to the matrin-3 network, bypassing the pre-requisite association with beta-catenin and Satb1 otherwise required. The matrin-3 network-tethered R271W Pit1 mutant, but not the untethered protein, restores Pit1-dependent activation of the enhancers and recruitment of co-activators, exemplified by p300, causing both enhancer RNA transcription and target gene activation. These studies have thus revealed an unanticipated homeodomain factor/beta-catenin/Satb1-dependent localization of targetgene regulatory enhancer regions to a subnuclear architectural structure that serves as an underlying mechanism by which an enhancer-bound homeodomain factor effectively activates developmental gene transcriptional programs.","[Skowronska-Krawczyk, Dorota; Ma, Qi; Schwartz, Michal; Scully, Kathleen; Li, Wenbo; Liu, Zhijie; Taylor, Havilah; Tollkuhn, Jessica; Ohgi, Kenneth A.; Notani, Dimple; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Schwartz, Michal] Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Kohwi, Yoshinori; Kohwi-Shigematsu, Terumi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Rosenfeld, MG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dkrawczyk@ucsd.edu; mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu,"Ma, Qi/C-9716-2015",,"UCSD Neuroscience Microscopy Shared Facility [P30 NS047101]; NIH [NS034934, DK039949, DK018477, HL065445, CA173903]; EMBO Long Term Fellowship; Swiss National Science Foundation; San Diego Foundation","We thank M.

High fever, viraemia and abnormalities in blood count and blood chemistry were evident in many animals before ZMapp intervention. Advanced disease, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes, mucosal haemorrhages and generalized petechia could be reversed, leading to full recovery.

The mechanisms responsible for the coexistence of distinct sub-clones and the biological consequences of this coexistence remain poorly understood. Here we used a mouse xenograft model to investigate the impact of sub-clonal heterogeneity on tumour phenotypes and the competitive expansion of individual clones. We found that tumour growth can be driven by a minor cell subpopulation, which enhances the proliferation of all cells within a tumour by overcoming environmental constraints and yet can be outcompeted by faster proliferating competitors, resulting in tumour collapse. We developed a mathematical modelling framework to identify the rules underlying the generation of intra-tumour clonal heterogeneity. We found that non-cell-autonomous driving of tumour growth, together with clonal interference, stabilizes sub-clonal heterogeneity, thereby enabling inter-clonal interactions that can lead to new phenotypic traits.","[Marusyk, Andriy; Tabassum, Doris P.; Almendro, Vanessa; Polyak, Kornelia] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Marusyk, Andriy; Almendro, Vanessa; Polyak, Kornelia] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Marusyk, Andriy; Almendro, Vanessa; Polyak, Kornelia] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tabassum, Doris P.; Polyak, Kornelia] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, BBS Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Altrock, Philipp M.; Michor, Franziska] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Altrock, Philipp M.; Michor, Franziska] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Altrock, Philipp M.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Polyak, Kornelia] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Polyak, Kornelia] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Polyak, K (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kornelia_polyak@dfci.harvard.edu,,,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Physical Sciences-Oncology Center [U54CA143798]; CDRMP Breast Cancer Research Program [W81XWH-09-1-0561]; Cellex Foundation; Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina [LPDS2012-12]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation,"We thank J.

We developed a relational analysis of bacterial, fungal and viral communities, which showed not only site specificity but also individual signatures. We further identified strain-level variation of dominant species as heterogeneous and multiphyletic.

A temperature maximum was previously observed there, and condensation was not expected for any of Titan's atmospheric gases. Here we report that this cloud is composed of micrometre-sized particles of frozen hydrogen cyanide (HCN ice). The presence of HCN particles at this altitude, together with temperature determinations from mid-infrared observations, indicate a dramatic cooling of Titan's atmosphere inside the winter polar vortex in early 2012. Such cooling is in contrast to previously measured high-altitude warming in the polar vortex(1), and temperatures are a hundred degrees colder than predicted by circulation models(4). These results show that post-equinox cooling at the winter pole of Titan is much more efficient than previously thought.","[de Kok, Remco J.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [de Kok, Remco J.] SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, NL-3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Teanby, Nicholas A.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Maltagliati, Luca; Vinatier, Sandrine] Univ Paris Diderot, Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LESIA Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Irwin, Patrick G.

The region has been interpreted as an ancient impact basin approximately 3,200 kilometres in diameter(5-7), although supporting evidence at the surface would have been largely obscured as a result of the great antiquity and poor preservation of any diagnostic features. Here we use data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission(8) to examine the subsurface structure of Procellarum. The Bouguer gravity anomalies and gravity gradients reveal a pattern of narrow linear anomalies that border Procellarum and are interpreted to be the frozen remnants of lava-filled rifts and the underlying feeder dykes that served as the magma plumbing system for much of the nearside mare volcanism. The discontinuous surface structures that were earlier interpreted as remnants of an impact basin rim are shown in GRAIL data to be a part of this continuous set of border structures in a quasi-rectangular pattern with angular intersections, contrary to the expected circular or elliptical shape of an impact basin(9). The spatial pattern of magmatic-tectonic structures bounding Procellarum is consistent with their formation in response to thermal stresses produced by the differential cooling of the province relative to its surroundings, coupled with magmatic activity driven by the greater-than-average heat flux in the region.","[Andrews-Hanna, Jeffrey C.] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Geophys, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Andrews-Hanna, Jeffrey C.] Colorado Sch Mines, Ctr Space Resources, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Besserer, Jonathan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Head, James W., III] Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Howett, Carly J.

In an 'all-geometric' approach to quantum computation(1,2), the quantum gates are implemented using Berry phases(3) and their non-Abelian extensions, holonomies(4), from geometric transformation of quantum states in the Hilbert space(5). Apart from its fundamental interest and rich mathematical structure, the geometric approach has some built-innoise-resilience features(1,2,6,7). On the experimental side, geometric phases and holonomies have been observed in thermal ensembles of liquid molecules using nuclear magnetic resonance(8,9); however, such systems are known to be non-scalable for the purposes of quantum computing(10). There are proposals to implement geometric quantum computation in scalable experimental platforms such as trapped ions(11), superconducting quantum bits(12) and quantum dots(13), and a recent experiment has realized geometric single-bit gates in a superconducting system(14). Here we report the experimental realization of a universal set of geometric quantum gates using the solid-state spins of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centres. These diamond defects provide a scalable experimental platform(15-17) with the potential for room-temperature quantum computing(16-19), which has attracted strong interest in recent years(20). Our experiment shows that all-geometric and potentially robust quantum computation can be realized with solid-state spin quantum bits, making use of recent advances in the coherent control of this system(15-20).","[Zu, C.; Wang, W. -B.; He, L.; Zhang, W. -G.; Dai, C. -Y.; Wang, F.; Duan, L. -M.] Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Ctr Quantum Informat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Duan, L. -M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Duan, LM (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Ctr Quantum Informat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",lmduan@umich.edu,,,National Basic Research Program of China [2011CBA00302]; Ministry of Education of China; IARPA MUSIQC program; AFOSR; ARO MURI program,"We thank M.

Recent developments employ microwaves(3), femto-second pulses(4), superchiral light(5) or photoionization(6) to determine chirality, yet the most widely used methods remain the traditional methods of measuring circular dichroism and optical rotation. However, these signals are typically very weak against larger time-dependent backgrounds(7). Cavity-enhanced optical methods can be used to amplify weak signals by passing them repeatedly through anoptical cavity, and two-mirror cavities achieving up to 10(5) cavity passes have enabled absorption and birefringence measurements with record sensitivities(8-10). But chiral signals cancel when passing back and forth through a cavity, while the ubiquitous spurious linear birefringence background is enhanced. Even when intracavity optics overcome these problems(11-15), absolute chirality measurements remain difficult and sometimes impossible. Here we use a pulsed-laser bowtie cavity ringdown polarimeter with counter-propagating beams(16,17) to enhance chiral signals by a factor equal to the number of cavity passes (typically > 10(3)); to suppress the effects of linear birefringence by means of a large induced intracavity Faraday rotation; and to effect rapid signal reversals by reversing the Faraday rotation and subtracting signals from the counter-propagating beams. These features allow absolute chiral signal measurements in environments where background subtraction is not feasible: we determine optical rotation from a-pinene vapour in open air, and from maltodextrin and fructose solutions in the evanescent wave produced by total internal reflection at a prism surface. The limits of the present polarimeter, when using a continuous-wave laser locked to a stable, high-finesse cavity, should match the sensitivity of linear birefringence measurements(8) (3 x 10(-13) radians), which is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than current chiral detection limits(7,14,15) and is expected to transform chiral sensing in many fields.","[Sofikitis, Dimitris; Bougas, Lykourgos; Katsoprinakis, Georgios E.; Spiliotis, Alexandros K.; Loppinet, Benoit; Rakitzis, T.

As the melt season progresses, the subglacial hydrologic system drains supraglacial meltwater more efficiently(1-4), decreasing basal water pressure(4) and moderating the ice velocity response to surface melting(1,2). However, limited direct observations of subglacial water pressure(4-7) mean that the spatiotemporal evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system remains poorly understood. Here we show that ice velocity is well correlated with moulin hydraulic head but is out of phase with that of nearby (0.3-2 kilometres away) boreholes, indicating that moulins connect to an efficient, channelized component of the subglacial hydrologic system, which exerts the primary control on diurnal and multi-day changes in ice velocity. Our simultaneous measurements of moulin and borehole hydraulic head and ice velocity in the Paakitsoq region of western Greenland show that decreasing trends in ice velocity during the latter part of the melt season cannot be explained by changes in the ability of moulin-connected channels to convey supraglacial melt. Instead, these observations suggest that decreasing late-season ice velocity may be caused by changes in connectivity in unchannelized regions of the subglacial hydrologic system. Understanding this spatiotemporal variability in subglacial pressures is increasingly important because melt-season dynamics affect ice velocity beyond the conclusion of the melt season(8-10).","[Andrews, Lauren C.; Catania, Ginny A.; Gulley, Jason D.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Andrews, Lauren C.; Catania, Ginny A.; Ryser, Claudia] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Hoffman, Matthew J.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Fluid Dynam & Solid Mech Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Hoffman, Matthew J.; Neumann, Thomas A.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Gulley, Jason D.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Geol & Mining Engn & Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Luethi, Martin P.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Glaciol & Geomorphodynam Grp, Phys Geog Div, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Luethi, Martin P.; Ryser, Claudia] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Hydraul Hydrol & Glaciol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hawley, Robert L.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Earth Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Andrews, LC (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA.",landrews@ig.utexas.edu,"Catania, Ginny/B-9787-2008; Neumann, Thomas/D-5264-2012; Andrews, Lauren/D-8274-2017","Andrews, Lauren/0000-0003-3727-4737; Hoffman, Matthew/0000-0001-5076-0540","United States National Science Foundation [OPP-0908156, OPP-0909454, ANT-0424589]; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_127197]; National Geographic Society [9067-12]; UTIG; NASA Cryospheric Sciences and Climate Modeling Programs within US Department of Energy, Office of Science; NSF [EAR-0946767]; NSF; NASA [EAR-0735156]; NSF OPP [ANT-1043681]","This project was supported by United States National Science Foundation grants OPP-0908156, OPP-0909454 and ANT-0424589 (to CReSIS), Swiss National Science Foundation grant 200021_127197, and National Geographic Society grant 9067-12.

This postseismic deformation is due primarily to viscoelastic relaxation of stresses induced by the earthquake rupture and continuing slip (afterslip) or relocking of different parts of the fault(2-6). When postseismic geodetic observations are used to study Earth's rheology and fault behaviour, it is commonly assumed that short-term (a few years) deformation near the rupture zone is caused mainly by afterslip, and that viscoelasticity is important only for longer-term deformation(6,7). However, it is difficult to test the validity of this assumption against conventional geodetic data. Here we show that new seafloor GPS(Global Positioning System) observations immediately after the great Tohoku-oki earthquake provide unambiguous evidence for the dominant role of viscoelastic relaxation in short-term postseismic deformation. These data reveal fast landward motion of the trench area, opposing the seaward motion of GPS siteson land. Using numerical models of transient viscoelastic mantle rheology, we demonstrate that the landward motion is a consequence of relaxation of stresses induced by the asymmetric rupture of the thrust earthquake, a process previously unknown because of the lack of near-field observations. Our findings indicate that previous models assuming an elastic Earth will have substantially overestimated afterslip downdip of the rupture zone, and underestimated afterslip updip of the rupture zone; our knowledge of fault friction based on these estimates therefore needs to be revised.","[Sun, Tianhaozhe; Wang, Kelin] Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Sun, Tianhaozhe; He, Jiangheng] Nat Resources Canada, Geol Survey Canada, Pacific Geosci Ctr, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada; [Iinuma, Takeshi; Fujimoto, Hiromi; Kido, Motoyuki; Osada, Yukihito] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9800845, Japan; [Miura, Satoshi; Ohta, Yusaku] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Res Ctr Predict Earthquakes & Volcan Erupt, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Hu, Yan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hu, Yan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Wang, KL (reprint author), Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.",kwang@nrcan.gc.ca,"Hu, Yan/N-9570-2014; Iinuma, Takeshi/J-6994-2012; Ohta, Yusaku/G-4457-2010","Hu, Yan/0000-0002-5704-4827; Iinuma, Takeshi/0000-0003-0386-2055; Ohta, Yusaku/0000-0003-4818-477X","Geological Survey of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through University of Victoria; University of Victoria; Howard E.

In semi-arid environments boron toxicity constrains productivity, and genetic improvement is the only effective strategy for addressing the problem(1). Wheat breeders have sought and used available genetic diversity from landraces to maintain yield in these environments; however, the identity of the genes at the major tolerance loci was unknown. Here we describe the identification of near-identical, root-specific boron transporter genes underlying the two major-effect quantitative trait loci for boron tolerance in wheat, Bo1 and Bo4 (ref. 2). We show that tolerance to a high concentration of boron is associated with multiple genomic changes including tetraploid introgression, dispersed gene duplication, and variation in gene structure and transcript level. An allelic series was identified from a panel of bread and durum wheat cultivars and landraces originating from diverse agronomic zones. Our results demonstrate that, during selection, breeders have matched functionally different boron tolerance alleles to specific environments. The characterization of boron tolerance in wheat illustrates the power of the new wheat genomic resources to define key adaptive processes that have underpinned crop improvement.","[Pallotta, Margaret; Schnurbusch, Thorsten; Hayes, Julie; Hay, Alison; Baumann, Ute; Langridge, Peter; Sutton, Tim] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Australian Ctr Plant Funct Genom, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia; [Schnurbusch, Thorsten] Leibniz Inst Plant Genet & Crop Plant Res IPK, Genebank Dept, D-06466 Gatersleben, Germany; [Paull, Jeff] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia","Sutton, T (reprint author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Australian Ctr Plant Funct Genom, Waite Campus, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia.",tim.sutton@acpfg.com.au,"Langridge, Peter/G-5864-2010; Schnurbusch, Thorsten/B-2249-2009","Langridge, Peter/0000-0001-9494-400X; Schnurbusch, Thorsten/0000-0002-5267-0677",Australian Research Council; Grains Research and Development Corporation; South Australian Government,"We thank N.

It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-causemortality(1). Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation(2,3), but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 x 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.","[Perry, John R.

This process relies on quiescent haematopoietic stem cells capable of differentiating, self renewing and expanding upon physiological demand(1,2). However, the mechanisms that regulate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and function remain largely unknown. Here we show that the neurotrophic factor receptor RET (rearranged during transfection) drives haematopoietic stem cell survival, expansion and function. We find that haematopoietic stem cells express RET and that its neurotrophic factor partners are produced in the haematopoietic stem cell environment. Ablation of Ret leads to impaired survival and reduced numbers of haematopoietic stem cells with normal differentiation potential, but loss of cell-autonomous stress response and reconstitution potential. Strikingly, RET signals provide haematopoietic stem cells with critical Bcl2 and Bcl2l1 surviving cues, downstream of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cyclic-AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) activation. Accordingly, enforced expression of RET downstream targets, Bcl2 or Bcl2l1, is sufficient to restore the activity of Ret null progenitors in vivo.

An estimated 70% of mouse genes undergo antisense transcription(1), including myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7), which encodes molecular motor proteins for heart contraction(2). Here we identify a cluster of lncRNA transcripts from Myh7 loci and demonstrate a new lncRNA-chromatin mechanism for heart failure. In mice, these transcripts, which we named myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (Myheart, orMhrt), are cardiac-specific and abundant in adult hearts. Pathological stress activates the Brg1-Hdac-Parp chromatin repressor complex(3) to inhib-it Mhrt transcription in the heart. Such stress-induced Mhrt repression is essential for cardiomyopathy to develop: restoring Mhrt to the prestress level protects the heart from hypertrophy and failure. Mhrt antagonizes the function of Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling factor that is activated by stress to trigger aberrant gene expression and cardiac myopathy(3). Mhrt prevents Brg1 from recognizing its genomic DNA targets, thus inhibiting chromatin targeting and gene regulation by Brg1. It does so by binding to the helicase domain of Brg1, a domain that is crucial for tethering Brg1 to chromatinized DNA targets. Brg1 helicase has dual nucleic-acid-binding specificities: it is capable of binding lncRNA(Mhrt) and chromatinized-but not naked-DNA. This dual-binding feature of helicase enables a competitive inhibition mechanism by which Mhrt sequesters Brg1 from its genomic DNA targets to prevent chromatin remodelling. A Mhrt-Brg1 feedback circuit is thus crucial for heart function. Human MHRT also originates from MYH7 loci and is repressed in various types of myopathic hearts, suggesting a conserved lncRNA mechanism in human cardiomyopathy. Our studies identify a cardioprotective lncRNA, define a new targeting mechanism for ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors, and establish a new paradigm for lncRNA chromatin interaction.","[Han, Pei; Li, Wei; Yang, Jin; Chen, Peng-Sheng; Chang, Ching-Pin] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Krannert Inst Cardiol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Han, Pei; Li, Wei; Yang, Jin; Chen, Peng-Sheng; Chang, Ching-Pin] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Div Cardiol, Dept Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Han, Pei; Li, Wei; Lin, Chiou-Hong; Shang, Ching; Nurnberg, Sylvia T.; Jin, Kevin Kai; Lin, Chieh-Yu; Lin, Chien-Jung; Xiong, Yiqin; Chien, Huan-Chieh; Ashley, Euan; Quertermous, Thomas] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xu, Weihong] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Genome Technol Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhou, Bin] Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Genet Pediat & Med Cardiol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Bernstein, Daniel] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chen, Huei-Sheng Vincent] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Del E Webb Neurosci Aging & Stem Cell Res Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chang, Ching-Pin] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Chang, Ching-Pin] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med & Mol Genet, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Chang, CP (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Krannert Inst Cardiol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",changcp@iu.edu,"Xiong, Yiqin/H-1710-2012; Lin, Chiou-Hong/L-1749-2015; Xu, Weihong/C-4175-2012","Xu, Weihong/0000-0002-3988-3571; Nurnberg, Sylvia/0000-0002-0869-484X","American Heart Association (AHA) [12EIA8960018]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HL118087, HL121197]; March of Dimes Foundation [6-FY11-260]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [RN2-00909]; Oak Foundation; Baxter Foundation; Stanford Heart Center Research Program; Indiana University (IU) School of Medicine-IU Health Strategic Research Initiative; IU Physician-Scientist Initiative; AHA; Lucile Packard Children's Foundation; NIH [HL109512, HL105194, HL78931, HL71140, HL116997, HL111770]; CIRM [RB2-01512, RB4-06276]","We thank C.-H.

Since the regenerative capacity of normal haematopoietic stem cells is limited by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and DNA double-strand breaks(2-4), we speculated that DNA damage might also constrain leukaemic self-renewal and malignant haematopoiesis. Here we show that the histone methyl-transferase MLL4, a suppressor of B-cell lymphoma(5,6), is required for stem-cell activity and an aggressive form of acutemyeloid leukaemia harbouring the MLL-AF9 oncogene. Deletion of MLL4 enhances myelopoiesis and myeloid differentiation of leukaemic blasts, which protects mice from death related to acute myeloid leukaemia. MLL4 exerts its function by regulating transcriptional programs associated with the antioxidant response. Addition of reactive oxygen species scavengers or ectopic expression of FOXO3 protects MLL-/- MLL-AF9 cells from DNA damage and inhibits myeloid maturation. Similar to MLL4 deficiency, loss of ATM or BRCA1 sensitizes transformed cells to differentiation, suggesting that myeloid differentiation is promoted by loss of genome integrity. Indeed, we show that restriction-enzyme-induced double-strand breaks are sufficient to induce differentiation of MLL-AF9 blasts, which requires cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1) (Cdkn1a) activity. In summary, we have uncovered an unexpected tumour-promoting role of genome guardians in enforcing the oncogene-induced differentiation blockade in acute myeloid leukaemia.","[Santos, Margarida A.; Faryabi, Robert B.; Ergen, Aysegul V.; Day, Amanda M.; Malhowski, Amy; Canela, Andres; Callen, Elsa; Chen, Hua-Tang; Wong, Nancy; Finkel, Nadia; Nussenzweig, Andre] NCI, Lab Genome Integr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Onozawa, Masahiro; Aplan, Peter D.] NCI, Genet Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lee, Ji-Eun; Ge, Kai] NIDDKD, Lab Endocrinol & Receptor Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gutierrez-Martinez, Paula; Rossi, Derrick J.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gutierrez-Martinez, Paula; Rossi, Derrick J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Deshpande, Aniruddha; Armstrong, Scott A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Deshpande, Aniruddha; Armstrong, Scott A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Sharrow, Susan] NCI, Expt Immunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ito, Keisuke] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ruth L & David S Gottesman Inst Stem Cell & Regen, Dept Cell Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Ito, Keisuke] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Albert Einstein Canc Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Nussenzweig, A (reprint author), NCI, Lab Genome Integr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",andre_nussenzweig@nih.gov,"Lee, Ji-Eun/F-7891-2011; Faryabi, Robert/H-3544-2015; Aplan, Peter/K-9064-2016","Lee, Ji-Eun/0000-0002-3768-7016; Faryabi, Robert/0000-0002-7931-2175; Ge, Kai/0000-0002-7442-5138","Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; National Cancer Institute [CA66996, CA140575]; National Institutes of Health; National Cancer Institute; Center for Cancer Research; Ellison Medical Foundation","We thank all members of the A.

Until recently, almost all the work done to study this limitation has been restricted to tumour cells(2). Here we identify a novel molecular mechanism by which endothelial cells regulate chemosensitivity. We establish that specific targeting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2) in endothelial cells is sufficient to induce tumour-cell sensitization to DNA-damaging therapies and thus inhibit tumour growth in mice. The clinical relevance of this work is supported by our observations that low blood vessel FAK expression is associated with complete remission in human lymphoma. Our study shows that deletion of FAK in endothelial cells has no apparent effect on blood vessel function per se, but induces increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation within perivascular tumour-cell compartments of doxorubicin-and radiotherapy-treated mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that endothelial-cell FAK is required for DNA-damage induced NF-kappa B activation in vivo and in vitro, and the production of cytokines from endothelial cells. Moreover, loss of endothelial-cell FAK reduces DNA-damage-induced cytokine production, thus enhancing chemosensitization of tumour cells to DNA-damaging therapies in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data identify endothelial-cell FAK as a regulator of tumour chemosensitivity. Furthermore, we anticipate that this proof-of-principle data will be a starting point for the development of new possible strategies to regulate chemosensitization by targeting endothelial-cell FAK specifically.","[Tavora, Bernardo; Reynolds, Louise E.; Batista, Silvia; Demircioglu, Fevzi; Fernandez, Isabelle; Lechertier, Tanguy; Lees, Delphine M.; Wong, Ping-Pui; Alexopoulou, Annika; Hodivala-Dilke, Kairbaan M.] Queen Mary Univ London, CR UK Ctr Excellence, Barts Canc Inst, Adhes & Angiogenesis Lab,Ctr Tumour Biol, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Elia, George] Queen Mary Univ London, CR UK Ctr Excellence, Barts Canc Inst, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Clear, Andrew; Gribben, John G.] Queen Mary Univ London, CR UK Ctr Excellence, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Haematooncol, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Ledoux, Adeline; Hunter, Jill; Perkins, Neil] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell & Mol Biosci ICaMB, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England","Hodivala-Dilke, KM (reprint author), Queen Mary Univ London, CR UK Ctr Excellence, Barts Canc Inst, Adhes & Angiogenesis Lab,Ctr Tumour Biol, London EC1M 6BQ, England.",K.Hodivala-Dilke@qmul.ac.uk,,"wong, ping pui/0000-0003-1592-4823; Lees, Delphine M/0000-0002-2119-3978","CR-UK [C9218/A12007, C1443/A9215]; AICR [12-1068]; Medical Research Council [G0901609]; National Cancer Institute [P01 CA95426]; Leukemia Lymphoma Research [11022]","We thank A.

Under many such conditions, the overall protein synthesis level is reduced, thereby dampening the stress response at the level of protein expression(1). For example, during glucose starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), translation is rapidly repressed, yet the transcription of many stress-and glucose-repressed genes is increased(2,3). Here we show, using ribosomal profiling and microscopy, that this transcriptionally upregulated gene set consists of two classes: one class produces messenger RNAs that are translated during glucose starvation and are diffusely localized in the cytoplasm, including many heat-shock protein mRNAs; and the other class produces mRNAs that are not efficiently translated during glucose starvation and are concentrated in foci that co-localize with P bodies and stress granules, a class that isenriched for mRNAs involved in glucose metabolism. Surprisingly, the information specifying the differential localization and protein production of these two classes of mRNA is encoded in the promoter sequence: promoter responsiveness to heat-shock factor 1 (Hsf1) specifies diffuse cytoplasmic localization and higher protein production on glucose starvation. Thus, promoter sequences can influence not only the levels of mRNAs but also the subcellular localization of mRNAs and the efficiency with which they are translated, enabling cells to tailor protein production to the environmental conditions.","[Zid, Brian M.; O'Shea, Erin K.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zid, Brian M.; O'Shea, Erin K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Syst Biol, Fac Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [O'Shea, Erin K.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [O'Shea, Erin K.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","O'Shea, EK (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Erin_Oshea@harvard.edu,,,American Cancer Society; New England Division Funding A Cure initiative; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank A.

Genetic evidence suggests that this process is initiated by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex(1-3). However, its involvement was puzzling, as the complex possesses exonuclease activity with the opposite (3' to 5') polarity from that required for homologous recombination(4,5). Consequently, a bidirectional model has been proposed(6-8) whereby dsDNA is first incised endonucleolytically and MRX then proceeds back to the dsDNA end using its 3' to 5' exonuclease. The endonuclease creates entry sites for Sgs1-Dna2 and/or Exo1, which then carry out long-range resection in the 5' to 3' direction. However, the identity of the endonuclease remained unclear. Using purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, we show that Sae2 promotes dsDNA-specific endonuclease activity by the Mre11 subunit within the MRX complex. The endonuclease preferentially cleaves the 5'-terminated dsDNA strand, which explains the polarity paradox. The dsDNA end clipping is strongly stimulated by protein blocks at the DNA end, and requires the ATPase activity ofRad50 and physical interactions between MRX and Sae2. Our results suggest that MRX initiates dsDNA break processing by dsDNA endonuclease rather than exonuclease activity, and that Sae2 is the key regulator of this process. These findings demonstrate a probable mechanism for the initiation of dsDNA break processing in both vegetative and meiotic cells.","[Cannavo, Elda; Cejka, Petr] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Cejka, P (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",cejka@imcr.uzh.ch,,"Cejka, Petr/0000-0002-9087-032X",Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3 133636],"We thank L.

Here we show late Eocene climate records revealing marked monsoon-like patterns in rainfall and wind south and north of the Tibetan-Himalayan orogen. This is indicated by low oxygen isotope values with strong seasonality in gastropod shells and mammal teeth from Myanmar, and by aeolian dust deposition in northwest China. Our climate simulations support modern-like Eocene monsoonal rainfall and show that a reinforced hydrological cycle responding to enhanced greenhouse conditions counterbalanced the negative effect of lower Tibetan relief on precipitation.

The lack of disease models using human cells has hampered the identification of a clinically effective treatment for these diseases. Here we show that statin treatment can rescue patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models and a mouse model of FGFR3 skeletal dysplasia. We converted fibroblasts from thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1) and ACH patients into iPSCs. The chondrogenic differentiation of TD1 iPSCs and ACH iPSCs resulted in the formation of degraded cartilage. We found that statins could correct the degraded cartilage in both chondrogenically differentiated TD1 and ACH iPSCs. Treatment of ACH model mice with statin led to a significant recovery of bone growth. These results suggest that statins could represent a medical treatment for infants and children with TD1 and ACH.","[Yamashita, Akihiro; Morioka, Miho; Kishi, Hiromi; Kimura, Takeshi; Yahara, Yasuhito; Okada, Minoru; Fujita, Kaori; Tsumaki, Noriyuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat, Dept Cell Growth & Differentiat, Cell Induct & Regulat Field, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Kimura, Takeshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Sawai, Hideaki] Hyogo Coll Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan; [Ikegawa, Shiro] RIKEN, Ctr Integrated Med Sci, Lab Bone & Joint Dis, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Tsumaki, Noriyuki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Tokyo 1020075, Japan","Tsumaki, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat, Dept Cell Growth & Differentiat, Cell Induct & Regulat Field, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",ntsumaki@cira.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Ikegawa, Shiro/N-6895-2015","Ikegawa, Shiro/0000-0003-0316-2147","Japan Science Technology Agency (JST), CREST; Research Center Network for Realization of Regenerative Medicine; MEXT [24890101, 26861716, 24390354]","We thank H.

Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and Kras(G12D) mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL.","[Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Benniof Childrens Hosp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lee, Leslie B.; Sampath, Deepak] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Akagi, Keiko] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Qing] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Div Haematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Aster, Jon C.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Shannon, K (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",shannonk@peds.ucsf.edu,,,"William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) from the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society of America [7019, 7703]; National Institutes of Health [R37 CA72614, R01 CA180037, K99 CA157950, K08 CA134649, P01 CA119070]; ALSAC of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Ohio Supercomputer Center [PAS0425]; Ohio Cancer Research Associate [GRT00024299]; American Cancer Society (ACS)","This work was supported by grants from the William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation to J.C.A. and K.

Observed star-to-star variations in logarithmic abundance within an open star cluster-a gravitationally bound ensemble of stars in the Galactic plane-are typically only about 0.01 to 0.05 over many elements(1-9), which is noticeably smaller than the variation of about 0.06 to 0.3 seen in the interstellar medium from which the stars form(10-14). It is unknown why star clusters are so homogenous, and whether homogeneity should also prevail in regions of lower star formation efficiency that do not produce bound clusters. Here we report simulations that trace the mixing of chemical elements as star-forming clouds assemble and collapse. We show that turbulent mixing during cloud assembly naturally produces a stellar abundance scatter at least five times smaller than that in the gas, which is sufficient to explain the observed chemical homogeneity of stars. Moreover, mixing occurs very early, so that regions with star formation efficiencies of about 10 per cent are nearly as well mixed as those with formation efficiencies of about 50 per cent. This implies that even regions that do not form bound clusters are likely to be well mixed, and improves the prospects of using 'chemical tagging' to reconstruct (via their unique chemical signatures, or tags) star clusters whose constituent stars have become unbound from one another and spread across the Galactic disk.","[Feng, Yi; Krumholz, Mark R.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Krumholz, MR (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",mkrumhol@ucsc.edu,,"Krumholz, Mark/0000-0003-3893-854X","NSF [AST-0955300, AST-1405962, AST-1229745]; NASA ATP [NNX13AB84G]; NASA TCAN [NNX14AB52G]; NASA through Space Telescope Science Institute [13256]; NASA [NAS 5-26555]","This work was funded by NSF grants AST-0955300 and AST-1405962, NASA ATP grant NNX13AB84G, NASA TCAN grant NNX14AB52G, and NASA through Hubble Award number 13256 issued by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres(1-5). Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core(6).","[Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Wilkins, Ashlee] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fraine, Jonathan; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Astrofis, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Fraine, Jonathan; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Astrobiol Inst Virtual Planetary Lab, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Madhusudhan, Nikku] Univ Cambridge, Inst Astron, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Todorov, Kamen] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys, CH-8049 Zurich, Switzerland","Fraine, J (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jfraine@astro.umd.edu,,"Todorov, Kamen/0000-0002-9276-8118; Jordan, Andres/0000-0002-5389-3944","'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy [IC120009]; FONDECYT [1130857]; BASAL CATA [PFB-06]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional","J.F., A.J. and N.E. acknowledge support from project IC120009 'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy; FONDECYT project 1130857; and BASAL CATA PFB-06.

Apparent imbalances in geochemical nitrogen budgets(1) have spurred numerous studies to measure the contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic N-2-producing metabolisms(denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation, respectively)(2,3). Recently, 'cryptic' sulphur cycling was proposed as a partial solution to the fundamental biogeochemical problem of closing marine fixed-nitrogen budgets in intensely oxygen-deficient regions(4). The degree to which the cryptic sulphur cycle can fuel a loss of fixed nitrogen in the modern ocean requires the quantification of sulphur recycling in OMZ settings. Here we provide a new constraint for OMZ sulphate reduction based on isotopic profiles of oxygen (O-18/O-16) and sulphur (S-33/S-32, S-34/S-32) in seawater sulphate through oxygenated open-ocean and OMZ-bearing water columns. When coupled with observations and models of sulphate isotope dynamics and data-constrained model estimates of OMZ water-mass residence time, we find that previous estimates for sulphur-driven remineralization and loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans are near the upper limit for what is possible given in situ sulphate isotope data.","[Johnston, D.

A variety of models link fluid flow and sediment transport processes to bedrock incision in canyons. The model components that represent sediment transport processes are increasingly well developed(3-5). In contrast, the model components being used to represent fluid flow are largely untested because there are no observations of the flow structure in bedrock canyons. Here we present a 524-kilometre, continuous centreline, acoustic Doppler current profiler survey of the Fraser Canyon in western Canada, which includes 42 individual bedrock canyons. Our observations of three-dimensional flow structure reveal that, as water enters the canyons, a high-velocity core follows the bed surface, causing a velocity inversion (high velocities near the bed and low velocities at the surface). The plunging water then upwells along the canyon walls, resulting in counter-rotating, along-stream coherent flow structures that diverge near the bed. The resulting flow structure promotes deep scour in the bedrock channel floor and undercutting of the canyon walls. This provides a mechanism for channel widening and ensures that the base of the walls is swept clear of the debris that is often deposited there, keeping the walls nearly vertical. These observations reveal that the flow structure in bedrock canyons is more complex than assumed in the models presently used. Fluid flow models that capture the essence of the three-dimensional flow field, using simple phenomenological rules that are computationally tractable, are required to capture the dynamic coupling between flow, bedrock erosion and solid-Earth dynamics.","[Venditti, Jeremy G.; Bradley, Ryan W.; Little, Malcolm] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Rennie, Colin D.; Bomhof, James] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Church, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada","Venditti, JG (reprint author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",jeremy_venditti@sfu.ca,"Rennie, Colin/D-1852-2015","Rennie, Colin/0000-0003-0683-1932",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council,"This study was supported by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council grants to M.

Current alternatives identify anomalocaridids as either stem-group euarthropods(1-3), crown-group euarthropods near the ancestry of chelicerates(4), or a segmented ecdysozoan lineage with convergent similarity to arthropods in appendage construction(5). Determining unambiguous affinities has been impeded by uncertainties about the segmental affiliation of anomalocaridid frontal appendages. These structures are variably homologized with jointed appendages of the second (deutocerebral) head segment, including antennae and 'great appendages' of Cambrian arthropods, or with the paired antenniform frontal appendages of living Onychophora and some Cambrian lobopodians. Here we describe Lyrarapax unguis-pinus, a new anomalocaridid from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota, southwest China, nearly complete specimens of which preserve traces of muscles, digestive tract and brain. The traces of brain provide the first direct evidence for the segmental composition of the anomalocaridid head and its appendicular organization. Carbon-rich areas in the head resolve paired pre-protocerebral ganglia at the origin of paired frontal appendages. The ganglia connect to areas indicative of a bilateral pre-oral brain that receives projections from the eyestalk neuropils and compound retina. The dorsal, segmented brain of L. unguispinus reinforces an alliance between anomalocaridids and arthropods rather than cycloneuralians. Correspondences in brain organization between anomalocaridids and Onychophora resolve pre-protocerebral ganglia, associated with pre-ocular frontal appendages, as characters of the last common ancestor of euarthropods and onychophorans. A position of Radiodonta on the euarthropod stem-lineage implies the transformation of frontal appendages to another structure in crown-group euarthropods, with gene expression and neuroanatomy providing strong evidence that the paired, pre-oral labrum is the remnant of paired frontal appendages(1).","[Cong, Peiyun; Ma, Xiaoya; Hou, Xianguang] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaoya; Edgecombe, Gregory D.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Strausfeld, Nicholas J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Strausfeld, Nicholas J.] Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Hou, XG (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.",xghou@ynu.edu.cn; flybrain@neurobio.arizona.edu,"CONG, Peiyun/D-2537-2009","CONG, Peiyun/0000-0001-9910-6478; Edgecombe, Gregory/0000-0002-9591-8011","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1302232, 41372031, 40962001]; Leverhulme Trust [F/00 696/T]; Center for Insect Science, University of Arizona; Air Force Research Laboratory [FA86511010001]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1302232, 41372031 and 40962001), a Leverhulme Trust Research Project Grant (F/00 696/T), by the Center for Insect Science, University of Arizona, and by a grant from the Air Force Research Laboratory (FA86511010001) to N.J.S.

The study of islands has proved particularly fruitful and has led to the theory that geographic area and isolation influence species colonization, extinction and speciation such that larger islands have more species and isolated islands have fewer species (that is, positive species-area and negative species-isolation relationships)(1-4). However, experimental tests of this theory have been limited, owing to the difficulty in experimental manipulation of islands at the scales at which speciation and long-distance colonization are relevant(5). Here we have used the human-aided transport of exotic anole lizards among Caribbean islands as such a test at an appropriate scale. In accord with theory, as anole colonizations have increased, islands impoverished in native species have gained the most exotic species, the past influence of speciation on island biogeography has been obscured, and the species-area relationship has strengthened while the species-isolation relationship has weakened. Moreover, anole biogeography increasingly reflects anthropogenic rather than geographic processes. Unlike the island biogeography of the past that was determined by geographic area and isolation, in the Anthropocene-an epoch proposed for the present time interval-island biogeography is dominated by the economic isolation of-human populations.","[Helmus, Matthew R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Amsterdam Global Change Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mahler, D.

Owing to the wasteful oxygenase activity and slow turnover of Rubisco, the enzyme is among the most important targets for improving the photosynthetic efficiency of vascular plants(2,3). It has been anticipated that introducing the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) from cyanobacteria into plants could enhance crop yield(4-6). However, the complex nature of Rubisco's assembly has made manipulation of the enzyme extremely challenging, and attempts to replace it in plants with the enzymes from cyanobacteria and red algae have not been successful(7,8). Here we report two transplastomic tobacco lines with functional Rubisco from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (Se7942). We knocked out the native tobacco gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco by inserting the large and small subunit genes of the Se7942 enzyme, in combination with either the corresponding Se7942 assembly chaperone, RbcX, or an internal carboxysomal protein, CcmM35, which incorporates three small subunit-like domains(9,10). Se7942 Rubisco and CcmM35 formed macromolecular complexes within the chloroplast stroma, mirroring an early step in the biogenesis of cyanobacterial beta-carboxysomes(11,12). Both transformed lines were photosynthetically competent, supporting autotrophic growth, and their respective forms of Rubisco had higher rates of CO2 fixation per unit of enzyme than the tobacco control. These transplastomic tobacco lines represent an important step towards improved photosynthesis in plants and will be valuable hosts for future addition of the remaining components of the cyanobacterial CCM, such as inorganic carbon transporters and the beta-carboxysome shell proteins(4-6).","[Lin, Myat T.; Hanson, Maureen R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Occhialini, Alessandro; Andralojc, P.

The origins of mesenchymal stem cells have been the subject of considerable discussion, and current consensus holds that perivascular cells form mesenchymal stem cells in most tissues. The continuously growing mouse incisor tooth offers an excellent model to address the origin of mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells dwell in a niche at the tooth apex where they produce a variety of differentiated derivatives. Cells constituting the tooth are mostly derived from two embryonic sources: neural crest ectomesenchyme and ectodermal epithelium(2). It has been thought for decades that the dental mesenchymal stem cells(3) giving rise to pulp cells and odontoblasts derive from neural crest cells after their migration in the early head and formation of ectomesenchymal tissue(4,5). Here we show that a significant population of mesenchymal stem cells during development, self-renewal and repair of a tooth are derived from peripheral nerve-associated glia. Glial cells generate multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that produce pulp cells and odontoblasts. By combining a clonal colour-coding technique(6) with tracing of peripheral glia, we provide new insights into the dynamics of tooth organogenesis and growth.","[Kaukua, Nina; Fried, Kaj] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Konstantinidou, Chrysoula; Pachnis, Vassilis] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Dyachuk, Vyacheslav; Kaucka, Marketa; Adameyko, Igor] Karolinska Inst, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dyachuk, Vyacheslav] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, AV Zhirmunsky Inst Marine Biol, Vladivostok 690041, Russia; [Furlan, Alessandro; Lopes, Natalia Assaife; Ernfors, Patrik] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Mol Neurobiol Unit, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [An, Zhengwen; Wang, Longlong; Sharpe, Paul] Guys Hosp, Inst Dent, Kings Coll London, Dept Craniofacial Dev & Stem Cell Biol, London SE1 3QD, England; [Hultman, Isabell; Ahrlund-Richter, Larsa] Karolinska Inst, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Blom, Hans; Brismar, Hjalmar] Royal Inst Technol, Sci Life Lab, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Suter, Ueli] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Hlth Sci, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Clevers, Hans] Koninklijke Nederlandse Akad Wetenschappen KNAW, Hubrecht Inst, NL-3508 AD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Clevers, Hans] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Mol Genet, NL-3508 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Clevers, Hans] Univ Helsinki, Dev Biol Program, Inst Biotechnol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Adameyko, I (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",Kaj.Fried@ki.se; Igor.Adameyko@ki.se,"Suter, Ueli/A-1624-2010; Brismar, Hjalmar/E-8524-2011","Brismar, Hjalmar/0000-0003-0578-4003; Dyachuk, Vyacheslav/0000-0001-8100-7367; Pachnis, Vassilis/0000-0001-9733-7686; Kaucka, Marketa/0000-0002-8781-9769",Swedish Research Council; Bertil Hallsten Research Foundation; StratRegen; Wallenberg Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; Medical Research Council [G0901599]; Wallenberg Scholar and European Research Council; National Graduate School in Odontological Science; Swedish Dental Association; EMBO Long-Term Fellowship; Stockholm County Council; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,"P.

Mechanisms that may seem detrimental can be repurposed to generate diversity. Here we show that the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides develops spontaneous resistance to the antifungal drug FK506 (tacrolimus) via two distinct mechanisms. One involves Mendelian mutations that confer stable drug resistance; the other occurs via an epigenetic RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated pathway resulting in unstable drug resistance. The peptidylprolyl isomerase FKBP12 interacts with FK506 forming a complex that inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin(1). Calcineurin inhibition by FK506 blocks M. circinelloides transition to hyphae and enforces yeast growth(2). Mutations in the fkbA gene encoding FKBP12 or the calcineurin cnbR or cnaA genes confer FK506 resistance and restore hyphal growth. In parallel, RNAi is spontaneously triggered to silence the fkbA gene, giving rise to drug-resistant epimutants. FK506-resistant epimutants readily reverted to the drug-sensitive wild-type phenotype when grown without exposure to the drug. The establishment of these epimutants is accompanied by generation of abundant fkbA small RNAs and requires the RNAi pathway as well as other factors that constrain or reverse the epimutant state. Silencing involves the generation of a double-stranded RNA trigger intermediate using the fkbA mature mRNA as a template to produce antisense fkbA RNA. This study uncovers a novel epigenetic RNAi-based epimutation mechanism controlling phenotypic plasticity, with possible implications for antimicrobial drug resistance and RNAi-regulatory mechanisms in fungi and other eukaryotes.","[Calo, Silvia; Shertz-Wall, Cecelia; Lee, Soo Chan; Bastidas, Robert J.; Granek, Joshua A.; Cardenas, Maria E.; Heitman, Joseph] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Nicolas, Francisco E.] Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Nicolas, Francisco E.; Torres-Martinez, Santiago; Ruiz-Vazquez, Rosa M.] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Granek, Joshua A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Granek, Joshua A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Ctr Genom Microbial Syst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Mieczkowski, Piotr] Univ N Carolina, High Throughput Sequencing Facil, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Heitman, J (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",heitm001@duke.edu,"Ruiz-Vazquez, Rosa Maria/K-6778-2014; Torres-Martinez, Santiago/K-7660-2014; NICOLAS, FRANCISCO/D-5717-2014","Ruiz-Vazquez, Rosa Maria/0000-0002-6675-8506; Torres-Martinez, Santiago/0000-0002-7083-4516; Granek, Joshua/0000-0003-3908-5016; Nicolas, Francisco Esteban/0000-0003-3762-5971","NIH [R37 AI39115-17, R01 AI50438-10, R01 CA154499-04]; Spanish MICINN [BFU2009-07220]; MINECO [BFU2012-32246]; FEDER","We thank R.

To perform this function, macrophages must have the capacity to monitor the functional states of their 'client cells': namely, the parenchymal cells in the various tissues in which macrophages reside. Tumours exhibit many features of abnormally developed organs, including tissue architecture and cellular composition(2). Similarly to macrophages in normal tissues and organs, macrophages in tumours (tumour-associated macrophages) perform some key homeostatic functions that allow tumour maintenance and growth(3-5). However, the signals involved in communication between tumours and macrophages are poorly defined. Here we show that lactic acid produced by tumour cells, as a by-product of aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis, has a critical function in signalling, through inducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and the M2-like polarization of tumour-associated macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect of lactic acid is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha). Finally, we show that the lactate-induced expression of arginase 1 by macrophages has an important role in tumour growth. Collectively, these findings identify a mechanism of communication between macrophages and their client cells, including tumour cells. This communication most probably evolved to promote homeostasis in normal tissues but can also be engaged in tumours to promote their growth.","[Colegio, Oscar R.; Ngoc-Quynh Chu; Szabo, Alison L.; Chu, Thach; Rhebergen, Anne Marie; Jairam, Vikram; Cyrus, Nika; Brokowski, Carolyn E.; Eisenbarth, Stephanie C.; Medzhitov, Ruslan] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Colegio, Oscar R.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Colegio, Oscar R.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale New Haven Transplantat Ctr, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Colegio, Oscar R.; Medzhitov, Ruslan] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Eisenbarth, Stephanie C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Phillips, Gillian M.; Phillips, Andrew J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Cline, Gary W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Medzhitov, Ruslan] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Medzhitov, R (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.",ruslan.medzhitov@yale.edu,,"Eisenbarth, Stephanie/0000-0002-1244-208X","National Cancer Institute [1K08CA172580-01]; Yale Center for Clinical Investigation [5KL2RR024138]; Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer [1 P50 CA121974]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG 108-09]; Dermatology Foundation; Blavatnik Family Foundation; National Institutes of Health [AI046688, AI089771, CA157461]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank members of the Medzhitov laboratory for discussions, L.

It is now appreciated that T-reg cells acquire tissue-specific adaptations that facilitate their survival and function(1); however, key host factors controlling theT(reg) response in the intestine are poorly understood. The interleukin (IL)-1 family member IL-33 is constitutively expressed in epithelial cells at barrier sites(2), where it functions as an endogenous danger signal, or alarmin, in response to tissue damage(3). Recent studies in humans have described high levels of IL-33 in inflamed lesions of inflammatory bowel disease patients(4-7), suggesting a role for this cytokine in disease pathogenesis. In the intestine, both protective and pathological roles for IL-33 have been described in murine models of acute colitis(8-11), but its contribution to chronic inflammation remains ill defined. Here we show in mice that the IL-33 receptor ST2 is preferentially expressed on colonic T-reg cells, where it promotes T-reg function and adaptation to the inflammatory environment. IL-33 signalling in T cells stimulates T-reg responses in several ways. First, it enhances transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1-mediated differentiation of T-reg cells and, second, it provides a necessary signal for T-reg-cell accumulation and maintenance in inflamed tissues. Strikingly, IL-23, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, restrained T-reg responses through inhibition of IL-33 responsiveness. These results demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized link between an endogenous mediator of tissue damage and a major anti-inflammatory pathway, and suggest that the balance between IL-33 and IL-23 may be a key controller of intestinal immune responses.","[Schiering, Chris; Krausgruber, Thomas; Chomka, Agnieszka; Adelmann, Krista; Griseri, Thibault; Bollrath, Julia; Hegazy, Ahmed N.; Owens, Benjamin M.

Cas9 hase merged as a versatile molecular tool for genome editing and gene expression control(3). RNA-guided DNA recognition and cleavage strictly require the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the target DNA(1,4-6). Here we report a crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 in complex with a single-molecule guide RNA and a target DNA containing a canonical 5'-NGG-3' PAM. The structure reveals that the PAM motif resides in a base-paired DNA duplex. The non-complementary strand GG dinucleotide is read out via major-groove interactions with conserved arginine residues from the carboxyterminal domain of Cas9. Interactions with the minor groove of the PAM duplex and the phosphodiester group at the +1 position in the target DNA strand contribute to local strand separation immediately upstream of the PAM. These observations suggest a mechanism for PAM-dependent target DNA melting and RNA-DNA hybrid formation. Furthermore, this study establishes a framework for the rational engineering of Cas9 enzymes with novel PAM specificities.","[Anders, Carolin; Niewoehner, Ole; Duerst, Alessia; Jinek, Martin] Univ Zurich, Inst Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Jinek, M (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Biochem, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",jinek@bioc.uzh.ch,,"Jinek, Martin/0000-0002-7601-210X",European Research Council [337284 ANTIVIRNA]; University of Zurich,"We are grateful to J.

Transformations that accomplish these two tasks simultaneously are in high demand, particularly if the catalysts, substrates and reagents are inexpensive and if the reaction conditions are mild. Here we report a facile multicomponent catalytic process that begins with a chemoselective, site-selective and diastereoselective copper-boron addition to a monosubstituted allene; the resulting boron-substituted organocopper intermediates then participate in a similarly selective allylic substitution. The products, which contain a stereogenic carbon centre, a monosubstituted alkene and an easily functionalizable Z-trisubstituted alkenylboron group, are obtained in up to 89 per cent yield, with more than 98 per cent branch-selectivity and stereoselectivity and an enantiomeric ratio greater than 99: 1. The copper-based catalyst is derived from a robust heterocyclic salt that can be prepared in multigram quantities from inexpensive starting materials and without costly purification procedures. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through enantioselective synthesis of gram quantities of two natural products, namely rottnestol and herboxidiene (also known as GEX1A).","[Meng, Fanke; McGrath, Kevin P.; Hoveyda, Amir H.] Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA","Hoveyda, AH (reprint author), Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",amir.hoveyda@bc.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-47480]; National Science Foundation [CHE-1111074, CHE-1362763]; LaMattina graduate fellowship in organic synthesis","This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM-47480) and the National Science Foundation (CHE-1111074 and CHE-1362763).

To understand themolecular mechanisms underlying cichlid phenotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of five lineages of African cichlids: the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an ancestral lineage with low diversity; and four members of the East African lineage: Neolamprologus brichardi/pulcher (older radiation, Lake Tanganyika), Metriaclima zebra (recent radiation, Lake Malawi), Pundamilia nyererei (very recent radiation, Lake Victoria), and Astatotilapia burtoni (riverine species around Lake Tanganyika). We found an excess of gene duplications in the East African lineage compared to tilapia and other teleosts, an abundance of non-coding element divergence, accelerated coding sequence evolution, expression divergence associated with transposable element insertions, and regulation by novel microRNAs. In addition, we analysed sequence data from sixty individuals representing six closely related species from Lake Victoria, and show genome-wide diversifying selection on coding and regulatory variants, some of which were recruited from ancient polymorphisms. We conclude that a number of molecular mechanisms shaped East African cichlid genomes, and that amassing of standing variation during periods of relaxed purifying selection may have been important in facilitating subsequent evolutionary diversification.","[Brawand, David; Turner-Maier, Jason; Johnson, Jeremy; Noh, Hyun Ji; Alfoeldi, Jessica; Berlin, Aaron; Gaffney, Leslie; Gnerre, Sante; Jaffe, David B.; Lara, Marcia; MacCallum, Iain; Przybylski, Dariusz; Ribeiro, Filipe J.; Sharpe, Ted; Swofford, Ross; Williams, Louise; Young, Sarah; Yin, Shuangye; Lander, Eric S.; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; Di Palma, Federica] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Brawand, David; Li, Yang I.; Haerty, Wilfried; Sanchez-Pulido, Luis; Ponting, Chris P.] Univ Oxford, MRC Funct Genom Unit, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Wagner, Catherine E.; Greuter, Lucie; Mwaiko, Salome; Seehausen, Ole] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochemis, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Wagner, Catherine E.; Keller, Irene; Greuter, Lucie; Seehausen, Ole] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Aquat Ecol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Malinsky, Milan; Miska, Eric A.] Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Malinsky, Milan; Aken, Bronwen; Hourlier, Thibaut; Searle, Steve] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England; [Fan, Shaohua; Simakov, Oleg; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Simakov, Oleg] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Ng, Alvin Y.; Lim, Zhi Wei; Lee, Alison P.; Venkatesh, Byrappa] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Bezault, Etienne; Renn, Suzy C.

To address this problem, we analysed proteomes of colon and rectal tumours characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and perform integrated proteogenomic analyses. Somatic variants displayed reduced protein abundance compared to germline variants. Messenger RNA transcript abundance did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumours. Proteomics identified five proteomic subtypes in the TCGA cohort, two of which overlapped with the TCGA 'microsatellite instability/CpG island methylation phenotype' transcriptomic subtype, but had distinct mutation, methylation and protein expression patterns associated with different clinical outcomes. Although copy number alterations showed strong cis- and trans-effects on mRNA abundance, relatively few of these extend to the protein level. Thus, proteomics data enabled prioritization of candidate driver genes. The chromosome 20q amplicon was associated with the largest global changes at both mRNA and protein levels; proteomics data highlighted potential 20q candidates, including HNF4A(hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha), TOMM34 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase). Integrated proteogenomic analysis provides functional context to interpret genomic abnormalities and affords a new paradigm for understanding cancer biology.","[Zhang, Bing; Wang, Jing; Wang, Xiaojing; Zhu, Jing; Liu, Qi; Chambers, Matthew C.; Tabb, David L.] Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Zhang, Bing; Slebos, Robbert J.

The APC/C is an unusually large multimeric cullin-RING ligase. Its activity is strictly dependent on regulatory coactivator subunits that promote APC/C-substrate interactions and stimulate its catalytic reaction. Because the structures of many APC/C subunits and their organization within the assembly are unknown, the molecular basis for these processes is poorly understood. Here, from a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a human APC/C-coactivator-substrate complex at 7.4 angstrom resolution, we have determined the complete secondary structural architecture of the complex. With this information we identified protein folds for structurally uncharacterized subunits, and the definitive location of all 20 APC/C subunits within the 1.2 MDa assembly. Comparison with apo APC/C shows that the coactivator promotes a profound allosteric transition involving displacement of the cullin-RING catalytic subunits relative to the degron-recognition module of coactivator and APC10. This transition is accompanied by increased flexibility of the cullin-RING subunits and enhanced affinity for UBCH10-ubiquitin, changes which may contribute to coactivator-mediated stimulation of APC/C E3 ligase activity.","[Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; Barford, David] Inst Canc Res, Div Struct Biol, London SW3 6JB, England; [Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; McLaughlin, Stephen H.; Barford, David] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Barford, D (reprint author), MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",dbarford@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"McLaughlin, Stephen/0000-0001-9135-6253",Cancer Research UK,We thank P. da Fonseca for her guidance preparing cryo electron microscopy grids and X.

Previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocity dispersions(4) or small apparent sizes(5-7), but so far no objects have been identified with both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. Here we report a candidate core in the process of formation 11 billion years ago, at redshift z = 2.3. This galaxy, GOODS-N-774, has a stellar mass of 100 billion solar masses, a half-light radius of 1.0 kiloparsecs and a star formation rate of 90(-20)(+45) solar masses per year. The star-forming gas has a velocity dispersion of 317 +/- 30 kilometres per second. This is similar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants of GOODS-N-774, which are compact quiescent galaxies at z approximate to 2 (refs 8-11) and giant elliptical galaxies in the nearby Universe. Galaxies such as GOODS-N-774 seem to be rare; however, from the star formation rate and size of this galaxy weinfer that many star-forming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical and near-infrared surveys.","[Nelson, Erica; van Dokkum, Pieter; Momcheva, Ivelina; Leja, Joel] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Franx, Marijn] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Brammer, Gabriel] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Schreiber, Natascha Foerster; Tacconi, Linda; Wuyts, Stijn] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [da Cunha, Elisabete; Rix, Hans-Walter; van der Wel, Arjen] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Bezanson, Rachel] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Kirkpatrick, Allison] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Astron, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Skelton, Rosalind] South African Astron Observ, ZA-7935 Cape Town, South Africa; [Whitaker, Katherine] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Astrophys Sci Div, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Nelson, E (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",erica.nelson@yale.edu,,"Skelton, Rosalind/0000-0001-7393-3336; Leja, Joel/0000-0001-6755-1315; da Cunha, Elisabete/0000-0001-9759-4797",STScI [GO-1277],Support from STScI grant GO-1277 is acknowledged.,,46,34,34,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Sep,2014,513,7518,,,,,394,+,,10.1038/nature13616,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AP1GD,WOS:000341814900054,25162527,No,,,11/20/17

These systems have masses of up to 2 x 10(8) solar masses, but half-light radii of just 3-50 parsecs(1). Dynamicalmass estimates show that many such dwarfs are more massive than expected from their luminosity(2). It remains unclear whether these high dynamical mass estimates arise because of the presence of supermassive black holes or result from a non-standard stellar initial mass function that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected(3,4). Here we report adaptive optics kinematic data of the ultra-compact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 that show a central velocity dispersion peak exceeding 100 kilometres per second and modest rotation. Dynamical modelling of these data reveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with amass of 2.1 x 10(7) solarmasses. This is 15 per cent of the object's total mass. The high black hole mass and mass fraction suggest that M60-UCD1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy. Our analysis also shows that M60-UCD1's stellar mass is consistent with its luminosity, implying a large population of previously unrecognized supermassive black holes in other ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(2).","[Seth, Anil C.; den Brok, Mark] Univ Utah, Dept Phys & Astron, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [van den Bosch, Remco; Neumayer, Nadine] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mieske, Steffen] European So Observ, Santiago 7630355, Chile; [Baumgardt, Holger] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Strader, Jay] Michigan State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Neumayer, Nadine; Hilker, Michael] European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Chilingarian, Igor] Smithsonian Astrophys Observ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chilingarian, Igor] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Sternberg Astron Inst, Moscow 119992, Russia; [McDermid, Richard; Spitler, Lee] Australian Astron Observ, Sydney, NSW 2113, Australia; [McDermid, Richard; Spitler, Lee] Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Brodie, Jean] Univ Calif Observ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Brodie, Jean] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Frank, Matthias J.] Heidelberg Univ, Zentrum Astron, Landessternwarte, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Walsh, Jonelle L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Astron, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Seth, AC (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Phys & Astron, 115 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",aseth@astro.utah.edu,"Chilingarian, Igor/N-5117-2016; Baumgardt, Holger/A-5444-2012","Chilingarian, Igor/0000-0002-7924-3253; van den Bosch, Remco/0000-0002-0420-6159; Hilker, Michael/0000-0002-2363-5522; Neumayer, Nadine/0000-0002-6922-2598; Spitler, Lee/0000-0001-5185-9876; McDermid, Richard/0000-0002-8175-7229","NSF [AST-1350389, 1102845, AST-1109878]; German Research Foundation [Ko4161/1]; Russian Science Foundation [14-22-00041]","This work was based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao (Brazil) and Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Productiva (Argentina).

Before that time, north African aridity was mainly controlled by the African summer monsoon (ASM)(5-8), which oscillated with Earth's orbital precession cycles. Afterwards, the Northern Hemisphere glaciation added an ice volume forcing on the ASM, which additionally oscillated with glacial-interglacial cycles(2). These findings led to the idea that the Sahara desert came into existence when the Northern Hemisphere glaciated similar to 2-3 Myr ago. The later discovery, however, of aeolian dune deposits similar to 7 Myr old(9) suggested a much older age, although this interpretation is hotly challenged(1) and there is no clear mechanism for aridification around this time. Here we use climate model simulations to identify the Tortonian stage (similar to 7-11 Myr ago) of the Late Miocene epoch as the pivotal period for triggering north African aridity and creating the Sahara desert. Through a set of experiments with the Norwegian Earth System Model(10) and the Community Atmosphere Model(11), we demonstrate that the African summer monsoon was drastically weakened by the Tethys Sea shrinkage during the Tortonian, allowing arid, desert conditions to expand across north Africa. Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations. These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period(4,12-14), with possible links to the emergence of early hominins in north Africa(15,16).","[Zhang, Zhongshi; Contoux, Camille] Uni Res Climate, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Zhang, Zhongshi; Yan, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Ramstein, Gilles] CE Saclay, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm IPSL, UMR8212, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Schuster, Mathieu] CNRS, Ecole & Observ Sci Terre, Inst Phys Globe Strasbourg UMR 7516, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Schuster, Mathieu] Univ Strasbourg, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Li, Camille] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway","Zhang, ZS (reprint author), Uni Res Climate, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",zhongshi.zhang@uni.no,"Ramstein, Gilles/L-3328-2014; Zhang, Zhongshi/L-2891-2013; Yan, Qing/C-5413-2013; Li, Camille/G-5802-2011","Ramstein, Gilles/0000-0002-1522-917X; Zhang, Zhongshi/0000-0002-2354-1622; Yan, Qing/0000-0001-5299-7824; Li, Camille/0000-0002-5439-2973; contoux, camille/0000-0001-8487-9275","Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05080803]; National 973 Program of China [2010CB950102]; Earth System Modelling (ESM) project - Statoil, Norway; Dynamics of Past Warm Climates (DYNAWARM) project - Centre for Climate Dynamics (SKD) at the Bjerknes Centre; Aurora mobility program France-Norway - Research Council of Norway","We thank N.

Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Rey, PF (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,,"Flament, Nicolas/0000-0002-3237-0757",Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

We analysed these and other ancient genomes(1-4) with 2,345 contemporary humans to show that most present-day Europeans derive from at least three highly differentiated populations: west European hunter-gatherers, who contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; ancient north Eurasians related to Upper Palaeolithic Siberians(3), who contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and early European farmers, who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model these populations' deep relationships and show that early European farmers had similar to 44% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population that split before the diversification of other non-African lineages.","[Lazaridis, Iosif; Mallick, Swapan; Fu, Qiaomei; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Li, Heng; Rohland, Nadin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Mallick, Swapan; Berger, Bonnie; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Li, Heng; Rohland, Nadin; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mittnik, Alissa; Bos, Kirsten I.; Posth, Cosimo; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Renaud, Gabriel; Castellano, Sergi; Fu, Qiaomei; de Filippo, Cesare; Pruefer, Kay; Sawyer, Susanna; Meyer, Matthias; Paeaebo, Svante; Kelso, Janet] Max Planck Inst Evolutionare Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Kirsanow, Karola; Bollongino, Ruth; Burger, Joachim] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Sudmant, Peter H.; Schraiber, Joshua G.; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Schraiber, Joshua G.; Klitz, William; Slatkin, Montgomery] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lipson, Mark; Berger, Bonnie] MIT, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lipson, Mark; Berger, Bonnie] MIT, Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Economou, Christos] Stockholm Univ, Archaeol Res Lab, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fu, Qiaomei] Chinese Acad Sci, IVPP, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Haak, Wolfgang; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA & Environm Inst, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Hallgren, Fredrik; Fornander, Elin] Cultural Heritage Fdn, S-72212 Vasteras, Sweden; [Delsate, Dominique; Guinet, Jean-Michel] Natl Museum Nat Hist, L-2160 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Delsate, Dominique] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Natl Ctr Archaeol Res, L-2160 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Francken, Michael] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Paleoanthropol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, D-78467 Constance, Germany; [Ayodo, George] Ctr Global Hlth & Child Dev, Kisumu 40100, Kenya; [Babiker, Hamza A.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolut Res, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Babiker, Hamza A.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol Res, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Babiker, Hamza A.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Infect Res, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Babiker, Hamza A.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, Muscat 123, Oman; [Bailliet, Graciela; Bravi, Claudio M.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Celular IMBICE, Lab Genet Mol Poblac, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Bailliet, Graciela; Bravi, Claudio M.] CICPBA, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Balanovska, Elena; Balanovsky, Oleg] Russian Acad Med Sci, Med Genet Res Ctr, Moscow 115478, Russia; [Balanovsky, Oleg] NI Vavilov Gen Genet Res Inst, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Barrantes, Ramiro] Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose 2060, Costa Rica; [Bedoya, Gabriel] Univ Antioquia, Res Grp GENMOL, Inst Biol, Medellin, Colombia; [Ben-Ami, Haim] Rambam Hlth Care Campus, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Bene, Judit; Melegh, Bela] Univ Pecs, Dept Med Genet, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Bene, Judit; Melegh, Bela] Univ Pecs, Szentagothai Res Ctr, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Berrada, Fouad] Al Akhawayn Univ Ifrane AUI, Sch Sci & Engn, Ifrane 53000, Morocco; [Brisighelli, Francesca] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Legal Med, Forens Genet Lab, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Busby, George B.

Two kinds of hypothesis have been proposed. Lethal violence is sometimes concluded to be the result of adaptive strategies, such that killers ultimately gain fitness benefits by increasing their access to resources such as food or mates(1-5). Alternatively, it could be a non-adaptive result of human impacts, such as habitat change or food provisioning(6-9). To discriminate between these hypotheses we compiled information from 18 chimpanzee communities and 4 bonobo communities studied over five decades. Our data include 152 killings (n = 58 observed, 41 inferred, and 53 suspected killings) by chimpanzees in 15 communities and one suspected killing by bonobos. We found that males were the most frequent attackers (92% of participants) and victims (73%); most killings (66%) involved intercommunity attacks; and attackers greatly outnumbered their victims (median 8:1 ratio). Variation in killing rates was unrelated to measures of human impacts. Our results are compatible with previously proposed adaptive explanations for killing by chimpanzees, whereas the human impact hypothesis is not supported.","[Wilson, Michael L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Anthropol, Humphrey Ctr 395, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Wilson, Michael L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Boesch, Christophe; Hohmann, Gottfried; Riedel, Julia; Wittig, Roman M.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionare Anthropol, Dept Primatol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fruth, Barbara] Univ Munich, Div Neurobiol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Fruth, Barbara] Royal Zool Soc Antwerp, Ctr Res & Conservat, Antwerp, Belgium; [Furuichi, Takeshi; Hashimoto, Chie; Matsuzawa, Tetsuro] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Gilby, Ian C.; Pusey, Anne E.] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Gilby, Ian C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Hobaiter, Catherine L.; Zuberbuehler, Klaus] Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol & Neurosci, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland; [Itoh, Noriko; Nakamura, Michio] Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan; [Koops, Kathelijne] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol & Anthropol, Div Biol Anthropol, Cambridge CB2 1QH, England; [Lloyd, Julia N.; Simmons, Nicole] Makerere Univ, Dept Zool, Kampala, Uganda; [Matsuzawa, Tetsuro] Japan Monkey Ctr, Inuyama, Aichi 4840081, Japan; [Mitani, John C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mjungu, Deus C.] Jane Goodall Inst Tanzania, Gombe Stream Res Ctr, Kigoma, Tanzania; [Morgan, David] Lester E Fisher Ctr Study & Conservat Apes, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Muller, Martin N.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Anthropol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Mundry, Roger] Max Planck Inst Evolutionare Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Pruetz, Jill] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Sanz, Crickette] Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Schel, Anne M.] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Waller, Michel; White, Frances] Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Watts, David P.] Yale Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Zuberbuehler, Klaus] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Wrangham, Richard W.] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Wilson, ML (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Anthropol, Humphrey Ctr 395, 301 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",wilso198@umn.edu,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X; Wilson, Michael/0000-0003-3073-4518","National Science Foundation [BCS-0648481, LTREB-1052693]; National Institutes of Health [R01 AI 058715]","This study was funded by National Science Foundation grants BCS-0648481 and LTREB-1052693 and National Institutes of Health grant R01 AI 058715.

These strategies fall into two classes. 'Resistance' makes it possible for a microorganism to grow in the constant presence of the antibiotic, provided that the concentration of the antibiotic is not too high. 'Tolerance' allows a microorganism to survive antibiotic treatment, even at high antibiotic concentrations, as long as the duration of the treatment is limited. Although both resistance and tolerance are important reasons for the failure of antibiotic treatments(3-6), the evolution of resistance(7-9) is much better understood than that of tolerance. Here we followed the evolution of bacterial populations under intermittent exposure to the high concentrations of antibiotics used in the clinic and characterized the evolved strains in terms of both resistance and tolerance. We found that all strains adapted by specific genetic mutations, which became fixed in the evolved populations. By monitoring the phenotypic changes at the population and single-cell levels, we found that the first adaptive change to antibiotic stress was the development of tolerance through a major adjustment in the single-cell lag-time distribution, without a change in resistance. Strikingly, we found that the lag time of bacteria before regrowth was optimized to match the duration of the antibiotic-exposure interval. Whole genome sequencing of the evolved strains and restoration of the wild-type alleles allowed us to identify target genes involved in this antibiotic-driven phenotype: 'tolerance by lag' (tbl). Better understanding of lag-time evolution as a key determinant of the survival of bacterial populations under high antibiotic concentrations could lead to new approaches to impeding the evolution of antibiotic resistance.","[Fridman, Ofer; Goldberg, Amir; Ronin, Irine; Balaban, Nathalie Q.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sudarsky Ctr Computat Biol, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Fridman, Ofer; Goldberg, Amir; Ronin, Irine; Balaban, Nathalie Q.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr NanoSci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shoresh, Noam] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Balaban, NQ (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sudarsky Ctr Computat Biol, Racah Inst Phys, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",nathalieqb@phys.huji.ac.il,,"Balaban, Nathalie/0000-0001-8018-0766",European Research Council [260871]; Israel Science Foundation [592/10]; Levtzion Fellowship,"We thank I.

This property of memory has been used clinically to treat maladaptive behaviours(2). However, the neuronal mechanisms and brain circuits that enable the switching of the valence of memories remain largely unknown. Here we investigated these mechanisms by applying the recently developed memory engram cell-manipulation technique(3),(4). We labelled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) a population of cells in either the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus or the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) that were specifically activated during contextual fear or reward conditioning. Both groups of fear-conditioned mice displayed aversive light-dependent responses in an optogenetic place avoidance test, whereas both DG- and BLA-labelled mice that underwent reward conditioning exhibited an appetitive response in an optogenetic place preference test. Next, in an attempt to reverse the valence of memory within a subject, mice whose DG or BLA engram had initially been labelled by contextual fear or reward conditioning were subjected to a second conditioning of the opposite valence while their original DG or BLA engram was reactivated by blue light. Subsequent optogenetic place avoidance and preference tests revealed that although the DG-engram group displayed a response indicating a switch of the memory valence, the BLA-engram group did not. This switch was also evident at the cellular level by a change in functional connectivity between DG engram-bearing cells and BLA engram-bearing cells. Thus, we found that in the DG, the neurons carrying the memory engram of a given neutral context have plasticity such that the valence of a conditioned response evoked by their reactivation can be reversed by re-associating this contextual memory engram with a new unconditioned stimulus of an opposite valence. Our present work provides new insight into the functional neural circuits underlying the malleability of emotional memory.","[Redondo, Roger L.; Kim, Joshua; Arons, Autumn L.; Ramirez, Steve; Liu, Xu; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, Dept Biol, RIKEN Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Redondo, Roger L.; Kim, Joshua; Arons, Autumn L.; Ramirez, Steve; Liu, Xu; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Redondo, Roger L.; Arons, Autumn L.; Liu, Xu; Tonegawa, Susumu] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Tonegawa, S (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, RIKEN Ctr Neural Circuit Genet, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tonegawa@mit.edu,,,RIKEN Brain Science Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; The JPB Foundation; National Institutes of Health [T32GM007287],"We thank X.

Expression of a particularvar subgroup, termed upsA, is linked to the obstruction of blood vessels in the brain and to the pathogenesis of human cerebralmalaria(3-6). The mechanism determining upsA activation remains unknown. Here we show that an entirely new type of gene silencing mechanism involving an exonuclease-mediated degradation of nascent RNA controls the silencing of genes linked to severe malaria. We identify a novel chromatin-associated exoribonuclease, termed PfR Nase II, that controls the silencing of upsA var genes by marking their transcription start site and intron-promoter regions leading to short-lived cryptic RNA. Parasites carrying a deficient PfRNase II gene produce full-lengthups Avar transcripts and intron-derived antisense longnon-coding RNA. The presence of stable upsA var transcripts overcomes monoallelic expression, resulting in the simultaneous expression of both upsA and upsC type PfEMP1 proteins on the surface of individual infected red blood cells. In addition, we observe an inverse relationship between transcript levels of PfRNase II andupsA-type var genes in parasites from severe malaria patients, implying a crucial role of PfRNase II in severe malaria. Our results uncover a previously unknown type of post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in malaria parasites with repercussions for other organisms. Additionally, the identification of RNase II as a parasite protein controlling the expression of virulence genes involved in pathogenesis in patients with severe malaria may provide new strategies for reducing malaria mortality.","[Zhang, Qingfeng; Wang, Fei] Tongji Univ Sch Med, Shanghai East Hosp, Res Ctr Translat Med, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingfeng; Wang, Fei] Tongji Univ Sch Med, Inst Infect Dis & Vaccine Dev, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingfeng; Siegel, T.

Although FGF1 is known as a mitogenic factor, FGF1 knockout mice develop insulin resistance when stressed by a high-fat diet, suggesting a potential role in nutrient homeostasis(3,4). Here we show that parenteral delivery of a single dose of recombinant FGF1(rFGF1) results in potent, insulin-dependent lowering of glucose levels in diabetic mice that is dose-dependent but does not lead to hypoglycaemia. Chronic pharmacological treatment with rFGF1 increases insulin-dependent glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and suppresses the hepatic production of glucose to achieve whole-body insulin sensitization. The sustained glucose lowering and insulin sensitization attributed to rFGF1 are not accompanied by the side effects of weight gain, liver steatosis and bone loss associated with current insulin-sensitizing therapies. We also show that the glucose-lowering activity of FGF1 can be dissociated from its mitogenic activity and is mediated predominantly via FGF receptor 1 signalling. Thus we have uncovered an unexpected, neomorphic insulin-sensitizing action for exogenous non-mitogenic human FGF1 with therapeutic potential for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","[Suh, Jae Myoung; Ahmadian, Maryam; Yoshihara, Eiji; Fan, Weiwei; Yin, Yun-Qiang; Yu, Ruth T.; Atkins, Annette R.; Downes, Michael; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jonker, Johan W.; Liu, Weilin; van Dijk, Theo H.; Havinga, Rick] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Ctr Liver Digest & Metab Dis, Dept Pediat, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [Jonker, Johan W.; Liu, Weilin; van Dijk, Theo H.; Havinga, Rick] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Ctr Liver Digest & Metab Dis, Dept Lab Med, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [Goetz, Regina; Huang, Zhifeng; Mohammadi, Moosa] New York Univ Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lackey, Denise; Osborn, Olivia; Olefsky, Jerrold M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liddle, Christopher] Westmead Millennium Inst, Storr Liver Unit, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Liddle, Christopher] Univ Sydney, Westmead Hosp, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Evans, RM (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",downes@salk.edu; evans@salk.edu,"Suh, Jae Myoung/B-3268-2015","Jonker, Johan/0000-0002-3919-5437; Mohammadi, Moosa/0000-0003-2434-9437","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [DK057978, DK090962, HL088093, HL105278, ES010337]; Glenn Foundation for Medical Research; Leona M. and Harry B.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes nutrient-consuming anabolic processes, such as protein synthesis(1). Here we show that as well as increasing protein synthesis, mTORC1 activation in mouse and human cells also promotes an increased capacity for protein degradation. Cells with activated mTORC1 exhibited elevated levels of intact and active proteasomes through a global increase in the expression of genes encoding proteasome subunits. The increase in proteasome gene expression, cellular proteasome content, and rates of protein turnover downstream of mTORC1 were all dependent on induction of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 1 (NRF1; also known as NFE2L1). Genetic activation of mTORC1 through loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex tumour suppressors, TSC1 or TSC2, or physiological activation of mTORC1 in response to growth factors or feeding resulted in increased NRF1 expression in cells and tissues. We find that this NRF1-dependent elevation in proteasome levels serves to increase the intracellular pool of amino acids, which thereby influences rates of new protein synthesis. Therefore, mTORC1 signalling increases the efficiency of proteasome-mediated protein degradation for both quality control and as a mechanism to supply substrate for sustained protein synthesis.","[Zhang, Yinan; Nicholatos, Justin; Ricoult, Stephane J.

Here we report the creation of such an assembly line using the iterative, reagent-controlled homologation of a boronic ester. This process relies on the reactivity of alpha-lithioethyl tri-isopropylbenzoate, which inserts into carbon-boron bonds with exceptionally high fidelity and stereocontrol; each chain-extension step generates a new boronic ester, which is immediately ready for further homologation. We used this method to generate organic molecules that contain ten contiguous, stereochemically defined methyl groups. Several stereoisomers were synthesized and shown to adopt different shapes-helical or linear-depending on the stereochemistry of the methyl groups. This work should facilitate the rational design of molecules with predictable shapes, which could have an impact in areas of molecular sciences in which bespoke molecules are required.","[Burns, Matthew; Essafi, Stephanie; Bame, Jessica R.; Bull, Stephanie P.; Webster, Matthew P.; Balieu, Sebastien; Butts, Craig P.; Harvey, Jeremy N.; Aggarwal, Varinder K.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Dale, James W.] Novartis Horsham Res Ctr, Horsham RH13 5AB, W Sussex, England","Aggarwal, VK (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.",craig.butts@bristol.ac.uk; jeremy.harvey@bristol.ac.uk; v.aggarwal@bristol.ac.uk,"Harvey, Jeremy/E-8848-2010; Butts, Craig/B-7576-2008","Harvey, Jeremy/0000-0002-1728-1596; Butts, Craig/0000-0001-6678-8839; Bull, Stephanie/0000-0001-5129-1731","EPSRC [EP/I038071/1, EP/G036764/1]; European Research Council (FP7, ERC grant) [246785]; Novartis","We thank EPSRC (EP/I038071/1) and the European Research Council (FP7/2007-2013, ERC grant no. 246785) for financial support.

In mammals, signals propagating from the motor cortex to the auditory cortex are thought to have a critical role in normal hearing and behaviour, yet the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which these motor-related signals influence auditory cortical activity remain poorly understood. Using in vivo intracellular recordings in behaving mice, we find that excitatory neurons in the auditory cortex are suppressed before and during movement, owing in part to increased activity of local parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Electrophysiology and optogenetic gain- and loss-of-function experiments reveal that motor-related changes in auditory cortical dynamics are driven by a subset of neurons in the secondary motor cortex that innervate the auditory cortex and are active during movement. These findings provide a synaptic and circuit basis for the motor-related corollary discharge hypothesized to facilitate hearing and auditory-guided behaviours.","[Schneider, David M.; Nelson, Anders; Mooney, Richard] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Mooney, R (reprint author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",mooney@neuro.duke.edu,,,Holland-Trice Graduate Fellowship in Brain Sciences; NIH [NS079929],"We thank the members of the Mooney laboratory for discussions regarding experimental design and data analysis; S.

Here we present the assembly and analysis of a northern white-checked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys) genome. We describe the propensity for a gibbon-specific retrotransposon (LAVA) to insert into chromosome segregation genes and alter transcription by providing a premature termination site, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for the genome plasticity of the gibbon lineage. We further show that the gibbon genera (Nomascus, Hylobates, Hoolock and Symphalangus) experienced a near-instantaneous radiation similar to 5 million years ago, coincident with major geographical changes in southeast Asia that caused cycles of habitat compression and expansion. Finally, we identify signatures of positive selection in genes important for forelimb development (TBX5) and connective tissues (COLIA1) that may have been involved in the adaptation of gibbons to their arboreal habitat.","[Carbone, Lucia; Meyer, Thomas J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Carbone, Lucia; Nevonen, Kimberly A.; Terhune, Elizabeth; Wilhelm, Larry J.] Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Carbone, Lucia] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Mol & Med Genet, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Carbone, Lucia; Lazar, Nathan H.; Sonmez, Kemal] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Bioinformat & Computat Biol Div, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Harris, R.

Here we describe a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We propose a molecular classification dividing gastric cancer into four subtypes: tumours positive for Epstein-Barr virus, which display recurrent PIK3CA mutations, extreme DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of JAK2, CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2); microsatellite unstable tumours, which show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic signalling proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family GTPase-activating proteins; and tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases. Identification of these subtypes provides a roalmap for patient stratification and trials of targeted therapies.","[Bass, Adam J.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bass, Adam J.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Thorsson, Vesteinn; Shmulevich, Ilya; Reynolds, Sheila M.; Miller, Michael; Bernard, Brady; Iype, Lisa; Kramer, Roger W.; Kreisberg, Richard; Rovira, Hector; Tasman, Natalie] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Hinoue, Toshinori; Laird, Peter W.; Shen, Hui; Weisenberger, Daniel J.; Bootwalla, Moiz S.; Lai, Phillip H.; Triche, Timothy, Jr.; Van Den Berg, David J.] Univ So Calif, USC Epigenome Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Curtis, Christina] Univ So Calif, Dept Prevent Med, USC Norris Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Schultz, Nikolaus; Weinhold, Nils; Askoy, B.

They display a broad range of properties across all wavelengths, reflecting the diversity in the physical conditions of the regions close to the central engine. These properties, however, are not random, but form well-defined trends. The dominant trend is known as 'Eigenvector l', in which many properties correlate with the strength of optical iron and [O III] emission(1-3). The main physical driver of Eigenvector 1 has long been suspected(4) to be the quasar luminosity normalized by the mass of the hole (the 'Eddington ratio'), which is an important parameter of the black hole accretion process. But a definitive proof has been missing. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals that the Eddington ratio indeed drives Eigenvector 1. We also find that orientation plays a significant role in determining the observed kinematics of the gas in the broad-line region, implying a flattened, disk-like geometry for the fast-moving clouds close to the black hole. Our results show that most of the diversity of quasar phenomenology can be unified using two simple quantities: Eddington ratio and orientation.","[Shen, Yue] Carnegie Observ, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; [Shen, Yue; Ho, Luis C.] Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ho, Luis C.] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Shen, Y (reprint author), Carnegie Observ, 813 Santa Barbara St, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA.",yshen@obs.carnegiescience.edu,,"Shen, Yue/0000-0003-1659-7035","NASA through Hubble Fellowship - Space Telescope Science Institute [HST-HF-51314.01]; NASA [NAS 5-26555]; Kavli Foundation, Peking University; Chinese Academy of Science [XDB09030102]","Support for the work of Y.S. was provided by NASA through Hubble Fellowship grant number HST-HF-51314.01,awarded by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy for NASA, under contract number NAS 5-26555.

Unlike semi-metallic graphene, layered TMDCs have a sizeable bandgap(3). More interestingly, when thinned down to a monolayer, TMDCs transform from indirect-bandgap to direct-bandgap semiconductors(4,5), exhibiting a number of intriguing optical phenomena such as valley-selective circular dichroism(6-8), doping-dependent charged excitons(9,10) and strong photocurrent responses(11). However, the fundamental mechanism underlying such a strong light-matter interaction is still under intensive investigation. First-principles calculations have predicted a quasi-particle bandgap much larger than the measured optical gap, and an optical response dominated by excitonic effects(12-14). In particular, a recent study based on a GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach, which employed many-body Green's-function methodology to address electron-electron and electron-hole interactions, theoretically predicted a diversity of strongly bound exdtons(14). Here we report experimental evidence of a series of excitonic dark states in single-layer WS2 using two-photon excitation spectroscopy. In combination with GW-BSE theory, we prove that the excitons are of Wannier type, meaning that each exciton wavefunction extends over multiple unit cells, but with extraordinarily large binding energy (similar to 0.7 electron-volts), leading to a quasiparticle bandgap of 2.7 electronvolts. These strongly bound exciton states are observed to be stable even at room temperature. We reveal an exciton series that deviates substantially from hydrogen models, with a novel energy dependence on the orbital angular momentum. These excitonic energy levels are experimentally found to be robust against environmental perturbations. The discovery of excitonic dark states and exceptionally large binding energy not only sheds light on the importance of many-electron effects in this two-dimensional gapped system, but also holds potential for the device application of TMDC monolayers and their heterostructures(15) in computing, communication and bio-sensing.","[Ye, Ziliang; O'Brien, Kevin; Zhu, Hanyu; Yin, Xiaobo; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cao, Ting; Louie, Steven G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cao, Ting; Louie, Steven G.; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Phys, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA","Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sglouie@berkeley.edu; xzhang@me.berkeley.edu,"Ye, Ziliang/A-2104-2011; Yin, Xiaobo/A-4142-2011; Wang, Yuan/F-7211-2011",,"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory through the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","This research was supported by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory through the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy under contract no.

The ratio of Northern Hemispheric to Southern Hemispheric (NH/SH) OH concentration is important for our understanding of emission estimates of atmospheric species such as nitrogen oxides and methane(4-6). It remains poorly constrained, however, with a range of estimates from 0.85 to 1.4 (refs 4,7-10). Here we determine the NH/SH ratio of OH with the help of methyl chloroform data (a proxy for OH concentrations) and an atmospheric transport model that accurately describes interhemispheric transport and modelled emissions. We find that for the years 2004-2011 the model predicts an annual mean NH-SH gradient of methyl chloroform that is a tight linear function of the modelled NH/SH ratio in annual mean OH. We estimate a NH/SH OH ratio of 0.97 +/- 0.12 during this time period by optimizing global total emissions and mean OH abundance to fit methyl chloroform data from two surface-measurement networks and aircraft campaigns(11-13). Our findings suggest that top-down emission estimates of reactive species such as nitrogen oxides in key emitting countries in the NH that are based on a NH/SH OH ratio larger than 1 may be overestimated.","[Patra, P.

This interpretation relies mainly on cosmic-ray exposure dating of glacial deposits. Recent studies, however, have established new production rates' for cosmogenic Be-10 and He-3, which make it necessary to update all chronologies in this region(1,5-15) and revise our understanding of cryospheric responses to climate variability. Here we present a new Be-10 moraine chronology in Colombia showing that glaciers in the northern tropical Andes expanded to a larger extent during the Antarctic cold reversal (14,500 to 12,900 years ago) than during the Younger Dryas. On the basis of a homogenized chronology of all Be-10 and He-3 moraine ages across the tropical Andes, we show that this behaviour was common to the northern and southern tropical Andes. Transient simulations with a coupled global climate model suggest that the common glacier behaviour was the result of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability superimposed on a deglacial increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. During the Antarctic cold reversal, glaciers advanced primarily in response to cold sea surface temperatures over much of the Southern Hemisphere. During the Younger Dryas, however, northern tropical Andes glaciers retreated owing to abrupt regional warming in response to reduced precipitation and land-surface feedbacks triggered by a weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Conversely, glacier retreat during the Younger Dryas in the southern tropical Andes occurred as a result of progressive warming, probably influenced by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Considered with evidence from mid-latitude Andean glaciers(16), our results argue for a common glacier response to cold conditions in the Antarctic cold reversal exceeding that of the Younger Dryas.","[Jomelli, V.; Brunstein, D.; Grancher, D.] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Lab Geog Phys, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Favier, V.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LGGE, UMR 5183, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Vuille, M.; Colose, C.] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Braucher, R.; Bourles, D.

Globally, at least 25 million kilometres of new roads are anticipated by 2050; a 60% increase in the total length of roads over that in 2010. Nine-tenths of all road construction is expected to occur in developing nations(1), including many regions that sustain exceptional biodiversity and vital ecosystem services. Roads penetrating into wilderness or frontier areas are a major proximate driver of habitat loss and fragmentation, wildfires, overhunting and other environmental degradation, often with irreversible impacts on ecosystems'. Unfortunately, much road proliferation is chaotic or poorly planned(3,4,6), and the rate of expansion is so great that it often overwhelms the capacity of environmental planners and managers(2-7). Here we present a global scheme for prioritizing road building. This large-scale zoning plan seeks to limit the environmental costs of road expansion while maximizing its benefits for human development, by helping to increase agricultural production, which is an urgent priority given that global food demand could double by mid-century(8,9). Our analysis identifies areas with high environmental values where future road building should be avoided if possible, areas where strategic road improvements could promote agricultural development with relatively modest environmental costs, and 'conflict areas' where road building could have sizeable benefits for agriculture but with serious environmental damage. Our plan provides a template for proactively zoning and prioritizing roads during the most explosive era of road expansion in human history.","[Laurance, William F.; Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben; Sloan, Sean; Goosem, Miriam; Venter, Oscar] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Laurance, William F.; Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben; Sloan, Sean; Goosem, Miriam; Venter, Oscar] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Kenyir Res Inst, Kuala Terengganu 21030, Malaysia; [O'Connell, Christine S.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [O'Connell, Christine S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mueller, Nathan D.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Environm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Phalan, Ben; Balmford, Andrew] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Van Der Ree, Rodney] Australian Res Ctr Urban Ecol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Van Der Ree, Rodney] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Arrea, Irene Burgues] Conservat Strategy Fund, San Jose, Costa Rica","Laurance, WF (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia.",bill.laurance@jcu.edu.au,"Research ID, CTBCC /O-3564-2014; Sloan, Sean/A-8630-2012; Phalan, Benjamin/A-5783-2009; James Cook University, TESS/B-8171-2012; Goosem, Miriam/D-8677-2012","Sloan, Sean/0000-0002-7834-0203; Phalan, Benjamin/0000-0001-7876-7226; Goosem, Miriam/0000-0001-9332-022X",Australian Research Council,"We thank T.

Theory predicts that the rise of these conflicts should drive a shift from a reliance on pre-copulatory female mate choice to polyandry in conjunction with post-zygotic mechanisms of sexual selection(2). This hypothesis has not yet been empirically tested. Here we apply comparative methods to test a key prediction of this hypothesis, which is that the evolution of placentation is associated with reduced pre-copulatory female mate choice. We exploit a unique quality of the livebearing fish family Poeciliidae: placentas have repeatedly evolved or been lost, creating diversity among closely related lineages in the presence or absence of placentation(5,6). We show that post-zygotic maternal provisioning by means of a placenta is associated with the absence of bright coloration, courtship behaviour and exaggerated ornamental display traits in males. Furthermore, we found that males of placental species have smaller bodies and longer genitalia, which facilitate sneak or coercive mating and, hence, circumvents female choice. Moreover, we demonstrate that post-zygotic maternal provisioning correlates with superfetation, a female reproductive adaptation that may result in polyandry through the formation of temporally overlapping, mixed-paternity litters. Our results suggest that the emergence of prenatal conflict during the evolution of the placenta correlates with a suite of phenotypic and behavioural male traits that is associated with a reduced reliance on pre-copulatory female mate choice.","[Pollux, B.

Pyrin, a candidate PRR, can bind to the inflammasome adaptor ASC to form a caspase 1-activating complex(1,2). Mutations in the Pyrin-encoding gene, MEFV, cause a human autoinflammatory disease known as familial Mediterranean fever(3-5). Despite important roles in immunity and disease, the physiological function of Pyrin remains unknown. Here we show that Pyrin mediates caspase 1 inflammasome activation in response to Rho-glucosylation activity of cytotoxin TcdB(6-8), a major virulence factor of Clostridium difficile, which causes most cases of nosocomial diarrhoea. The glucosyltransferase-inactive TcdB mutant loses the inflammasome-stimulating activity. Other Rho-inactivating toxins, including FIC-domain adenylyltransferases (Vibrioparahaemolyticus VopS and Histophilus somnilbpA) and Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylating C3 toxin, can also biochemically activate the Pyrin inflammasome in their enzymatic activitydependent manner. These toxins all target the Rho subfamily and modify a switch-I residue. We further demonstrate that Burkholderia cenocepacia inactivates RHOA by deamidating Asn 41, also in the switch-I region, and thereby triggers Pyrin inflammasome activation, both of which require the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS). Loss of the Pyrin inflammasome causes elevated intra-macrophage growth of B. cenocepacia and diminished lung inflammation in mice. Thus, Pyrin functions to sense pathogen modification and inactivation of Rho GTPases, representing a new paradigm in mammalian innate immunity.","[Xu, Hao; Yang, Jieling; Gao, Wenqing; Li, Lin; Li, Peng; Zhang, Li; Gong, Yi-Nan; Peng, Xiaolan; Chen, She; Wang, Fengchao; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jieling; Shao, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xi, Jianzhong Jeff] Peking Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Shao, Feng] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Canc Med, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Shao, F (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",shaofeng@nibs.ac.cn,"Xi, Jianzhong/J-1420-2014",,International Early Career Scientist grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program [2012CB518700]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB08020202]; China National Science Foundation Program for Distinguished Young Scholars [31225002],"We thank V.

Despite this importance, microbial diversity is only now being mapped at scales relevant to nature(5), while the viral diversity associated with any particular host remains little researched. Here we quantify host-associated viral diversity using viral-tagged metagenomics, which links viruses to specific host cells for high-throughput screening and sequencing. In a single experiment, we screened 10(7) Pacific Ocean viruses against a single strain of Synechococcus and found that naturally occurring cyanophage genome sequence space is statistically clustered into discrete populations. These population-based, host-linked viral ecological data suggest that, for this single host and seawater sample alone, there are at least 26 double-stranded DNA viral populations with estimated relative abundances ranging from 0.06 to 18.2%. These populations include previously cultivated cyanophage and new viral types missed by decades of isolate-based studies. Nucleotide identities of homologous genes mostly varied by less than 1% within populations, even in hypervariable genome regions, and by 42-71% between populations, which provides benchmarks for viral metagenomics and genome-based viral species definitions. Together these findings showcase a new approach to viral ecology that quantitatively links objectively defined environmental viral populations, and their genomes, to their hosts.","[Deng, Li; Gregory, Ann C.; Poulos, Bonnie T.; Sullivan, Matthew B.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Ignacio-Espinoza, J.

To adapt CO2 intake to water loss, plants regulate the development of stomatal gas exchange pores in the aerial epidermis. A diverse range of plant species show a decrease in stomatal density in response to the continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 (ref. 4). To date, one mutant that exhibits deregulation of this CO2-controlled stomatal development response, hic (which is defective in cell-wall wax biosynthesis, ref. 5), has been identified. Here we show that recently isolated Arabidopsis thaliana beta-carbonic anhydrase double mutants (cal ca4)(6) exhibit an inversion in their response to elevated CO2, showing increased stomatal development at elevated CO2 levels. We characterized the mechanisms mediating this response and identified an extracellular signalling pathway involved in the regulation of CO2-controlled stomatal development by carbonic anhydrases. RNA-seq analyses of transcripts show that the extracellular pro-peptide-encoding gene EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2)(7,8), but not EPFI (ref. 9), is induced in wild-type leaves but not in cal ca4 mutant leaves at elevated CO2 levels. Moreover, EPF2 is essential for CO2 control of stomatal development. Using cell-wall proteomic analyses and CO2-dependent transcriptomic analyses, we identified a novel CO2-induced extracellular protease, CRSP (CO2 RESPONSE SECRETED PROTEASE), as a mediator of CO2-controlled stomatal development. Our results identify mechanisms and genes that function in the repression of stomatal development in leaves during atmospheric CO2 elevation, including the carbonic-anhydrase-encoding genes CA1 and CA4 and the secreted protease CRSP, which cleaves the pro-peptide EPF2, in turn repressing stomatal development. Elucidation of these mechanisms advances the understanding of how plants perceive and relay the elevated CO2 signal and provides a framework to guide future research into how environmental challenges can modulate gas exchange in plants.","[Engineer, Cawas B.; Hu, Honghong; Schroeder, Julian I.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ghassemian, Majid] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Anderson, Jeffrey C.; Peck, Scott C.] Univ Missouri, Dept Chem, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Schroeder, JI (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jischroeder@ucsd.edu,"Anderson, Jeff/I-1316-2017",,"National Science Foundation [MCB0918220, MCB1414339, IOS-1025837]; National Institutes of Health [GM060396-ES010337]; BAYER-UC Discovery grant; seed grant from the UCSD-SDCSB [GM085764]; Systems Biology Center; Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-03ER15449]","We thank K.

These consistent metabolic alterations are associated with normoxic stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)3 secondary to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations that occur in over 90% of ccRCC tumours(4). However, kidney-specific VHL deletion in mice fails to elicit ccRCC-specific metabolic phenotypes and tumour formation(5), suggesting that additional mechanisms are essential. Recent large-scale sequencing analyses revealed the loss of several chromatin remodelling enzymes in a subset of ccRCC (these included polybromo-1, SET domain containing 2 and BRCA1 -associated protein-1, among others)(6-9), indicating that epigenetic perturbations are probably important contributors to the natural history of this disease. Here we used an integrative approach comprising pan-metabolomic profiling and metabolic gene set analysis and determined that the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1)(10) is uniformly depleted in over six hundred ccRCC tumours examined. Notably, the human FBP1 locus resides on chromosome 9q22, the loss of which is associated with poor prognosis for ccRCC patients"". Our data further indicate that FBP1 inhibits ccRCC progression through two distinct mechanisms. First, FBP1 antagonizes glycolytic flux in renal tubular epithelial cells, the presumptive ccRCC cell of origin(12), thereby inhibiting a potential Warburg effect(13,14). Second, in pVHL (the protein encoded by the VHL gene)-deficient ccRCC cells, FBP1 restrains cell proliferation, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in a catalyticactivity-independent manner, by inhibiting nuclear HIF function via direct interaction with the HIF inhibitory domain. This unique dual function of the FBP1 protein explains its ubiquitous loss in ccRCC, distinguishing FBP1 from previously identified tumour suppressors that are not consistently mutated in all tumours(6,7,15).","[Li, Bo; Qiu, Bo; Lee, David S.

Deregulated post-transcriptional modulation, such as that governed by microRNAs targeting linear sequence elements in messenger RNAs, has been implicated in the progression of many cancer types(3-7). A defining feature of RNA is its ability to fold into structures. However, the roles of structural mRNA elements in cancer progression remain unexplored. Here we performed an unbiased search for post-transcriptional modulators of mRNA stability in breast cancer by conducting whole-genome transcript stability measurements in poorly and highly metastatic isogenic human breast cancer lines. Using a computational framework that searches RNA sequence and structure space(8), we discovered a family of GC-rich structural cis-regulatory RNA elements, termed sRSEs for structural RNA stability elements, which are significantly overrepresented in transcripts displaying reduced stability in highly metastatic cells. By integrating computational and biochemical approaches, we identified TARBP2, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein implicated in microRNA processing, as the trans factor that binds the sRSE family and similar structural elements collectively termed TARBP2-binding structural elements (TBSEs) in transcripts. TARBP2 is overexpressed in metastatic cells and metastatic human breast tumours and destabilizes transcripts containing TBSEs. Endogenous TARBP2 promotes metastatic cell invasion and colonization by destabilizing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ZNF395 transcripts, two genes previously associated with Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, respectively. We reveal these genes to be novel metastasis suppressor genes in breast cancer. The cleavage product of APP, extracellular alpha-myloida peptide, directly suppresses invasion while ZNF395 transcriptionally represses a pro-metastatic gene expression program. The expression levels of TARBP2, APP and ZNF395 in human breast carcinomas support their experimentally uncovered roles in metastasis. Our findings establish a non-canonical and direct role for TARBP2 in mammalian gene expression regulation and reveal that regulated RNA destabilization through protein-mediated binding of mRNA structural elements can govern cancer progression.","[Goodarzi, Hani; Zhang, Steven; Buss, Colin G.; Fish, Lisa; Tavazoie, Sohail F.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Syst Canc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Tavazoie, Saeed] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Tavazoie, Saeed] Columbia Univ, Dept Syst Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Tavazoie, S (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA.",st2744@columbia.edu; stavazoie@rockefeller.edu,,"Goodarzi, Hani/0000-0002-9648-8949",Department of Defense Era of Hope Scholar; Department of Defense Breast Cancer Collaborative Scholars and Innovators Award; National Human Genome Research Institute [R01 HG003219],"We thank C.

Two large membrane protein complexes, photosystem I and II (PSI and PSII), act in series to catalyse the light-driven reactions in photosynthesis. PSII catalyses the light-driven water splitting process, which maintains the Earth's oxygenic atmosphere(1). In this process, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII cycles through five states, S-0 to S-4, in which four electrons are sequentially extracted from the OEC in four light-driven charge-separation events. Here we describe time resolved experiments on PSII nano/microcrystals from Thermosynechococcus elongatus performed with the recently developed(2) technique of serial femtosecond crystallography. Structures have been determined from PSII in the dark S-1 state and after double laser excitation (putative S-3 state) at 5 and 5.5 angstrom resolution, respectively. The results provide evidence that PSII undergoes significant conformational changes at the electron acceptor side and at the Mn4CaO5 core of the OEC. These include an elongation of the metal cluster, accompanied by changes in the protein environment, which could allow for binding of the second substrate water molecule between the more distant protruding Mn (referred to as the 'dangler' Mn) and the Mn3CaOx cubane in the S-2 to S-3 transition, as predicted by spectroscopic and computational studies(3,4). This work shows the great potential for time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography for investigation of catalytic processes in biomolecules.","[Kupitz, Christopher; Basu, Shibom; Grotjohann, Ingo; Fromme, Raimund; Rendek, Kimberly N.; Hunter, Mark S.; Yang, Jay-How; Cobb, Danielle E.; Reeder, Brenda; Bergkamp, Jesse J.; Chao, Tzu-Chiao; Conrad, Chelsie E.; Ros, Alexandra; Roy-Chowdhury, Shatabdi; Moore, Thomas A.; Moore, Ana L.; Fromme, Petra] Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Zatsepin, Nadia A.; Wang, Dingjie; James, Daniel; Liu, Haiguang; Kirian, Richard A.; Schmidt, Kevin; Doak, R.

Polypterus is a member of the basal-most group of ray-finned fish (actinopterygians) and has many plesiomorphic morphologies that are comparable to elpistostegid fishes, which are stem tetrapods. Polypterus therefore serves as an extant analogue of stem tetrapods, allowing us to examine how developmental plasticity affects the 'terrestrialization' of fish. We measured the developmental plasticity of anatomical and biomechanical responses in Polypterus reared on land. Here we show the remarkable correspondence between the environmentally induced phenotypes of terrestrialized Polypterus and the ancient anatomical changes in stem tetrapods, and we provide insight into stem tetrapod behavioural evolution. Our results raise the possibility that environmentally induced developmental plasticity facilitated the origin of the terrestrial traits that led to tetrapods.","[Standen, Emily M.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Du, Trina Y.; Larsson, Hans C.

Here we characterize the gut microbiome in liver cirrhosis by comparing 98 patients and 83 healthy control individuals. We build a reference gene set for the cohort containing 2.69 million genes, 36.1% of which are novel. Quantitative metagenomics reveals 75,245 genes that differ in abundance between the patients and healthy individuals (false discovery rate < 0.0001) and can be grouped into 66 clusters representing cognate bacterial species; 28 are enriched in patients and 38 in control individuals. Most (54%) of the patient-enriched, taxonomically assigned species are of buccal origin, suggesting an invasion of the gut from the mouth in liver cirrhosis. Biomarkers specific to liver cirrhosis at gene and function levels are revealed by a comparison with those for type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. On the basis of only 15 biomarkers, a highly accurate patient discrimination index is created and validated on an independent cohort.

Here we report an eIF4A RNA helicase-dependent mechanism of translational control that contributes to oncogenesis and underlies the anticancer effects of silvestrol and related compounds. For example, eIF4A promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects against murine and human leukaemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5' untranslated region (UTR) sequences such as the 12-nucleotide guanine quartet (CGG)(4) motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, superenhancer-associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5' UTRs of select cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase.","[Wolfe, Andrew L.; Singh, Kamini; Sanghvi, Viraj R.; Mavrakis, Konstantinos J.; Jiang, Man; Van der Meulen, Joni; Schatz, Jonathan H.; Zhao, Chunying; Wendel, Hans-Guido] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wolfe, Andrew L.] Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zhong, Yi; Drewe, Philipp; Raetsch, Gunnar] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Dept, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rajasekhar, Vinagolu K.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Stem Cell Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rajasekhar, Vinagolu K.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Roderick, Justine E.; Kelliher, Michelle A.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Van der Meulen, Joni; Rondou, Pieter; Speleman, Frank] Univ Ghent, Ctr Med Genet, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Schatz, Jonathan H.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rodrigo, Christina M.; Porco, John A., Jr.] Boston Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Chem Methodol & Lib Dev, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [de Stanchina, Elisa] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Mol Pharmacol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Teruya-Feldstein, Julie] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Pelletier, Jerry] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Pelletier, Jerry] McGill Univ, Dept Oncol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Pelletier, Jerry] McGill Univ, Rosalind & Morris Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","Wendel, HG (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA.",Ratschg@mskcc.org; wendelh@mskcc.org,"Ratsch, Gunnar/O-5914-2017","Ratsch, Gunnar/0000-0001-5486-8532; Schatz, Jonathan/0000-0003-1842-228X; Boss, Philipp/0000-0002-5459-9771","National Cancer Institute [R01-CA142798-01]; Leukemia Research Foundation; Experimental Therapeutics Center; American Cancer Society [10284, PF-11-077-01-CDD]; European Union [PITN-GA-2012-316861]; Fund for Scientific Research FWO Flanders [G.0198.08, G.0869.10N]; GOA-UGent [12051203]; Stichting tegen Kanker; Belgian Program of Interuniversity Poles of Attraction; Belgian Foundation Against Cancer; Lymphoma Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health [GM-067041, GM-073855]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-10653]","We thank the members of A.L.W.'s thesis committee: N.

These structures are seen in maps derived from spectroscopic surveys(1,2) that reveal networks of structure that are interconnected with no clear boundaries. Extended regions with a high concentration of galaxies are called 'superclusters', although this term is not precise. There is, however, another way to analyse the structure. If the distance to each galaxy from Earth is directly measured, then the peculiar velocity can be derived from the subtraction of the mean cosmic expansion, the product of distance times the Hubble constant, from observed velocity. The peculiar velocity is the line-of-sight departure from the cosmic expansion and arises from gravitational perturbations; a map of peculiar velocities can be translated into a map of the distribution of matter(3). Here we report a map of structure made using a catalogue of peculiar velocities. We find locations where peculiar velocity flows diverge, as water does at watershed divides, and we trace the surface of divergent points that surrounds us. Within the volume enclosed by this surface, the motions of galaxies are inward after removal of the mean cosmic expansion and long range flows. We define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster, which we call Laniakea.","[Tully, R.

The previous mass estimates were based on scaling relations that use low-frequency characteristic time-scales which have large intrinsic uncertainties(8,9). For stellar-mass black holes, we know that the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100-450 hertz) in the X-ray emission that occur in a 3: 2 frequency ratio are stable and scale in frequency inversely with black hole mass with a reasonably small dispersion(10-15). The discovery of such stable oscillations thus potentially offers an alternative and less ambiguous means of mass determination for intermediate-mass black holes, but has hitherto not been realized. Here we report stable, twin-peak (3: 2 frequency ratio) X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations from M82 X-1 at frequencies of 3.32+/-0.06 hertz and 5.07+/-0.06 hertz. Assuming that we can extrapolate the inverse-mass scaling that holds for stellar-mass black holes, we estimate the black hole mass of M82 X-1 to be 428+/-105 solar masses. In addition, we can estimate the mass using the relativistic precession model, from which we get a value of 415+/-63 solar masses.","[Pasham, Dheeraj R.; Mushotzky, Richard F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Pasham, Dheeraj R.; Strohmayer, Tod E.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Astrophys Sci Div, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Pasham, Dheeraj R.; Strohmayer, Tod E.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Joint Space Sci Inst, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Pasham, DR (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dheeraj@astro.umd.edu,,,,,,48,70,71,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Sep,2014,513,7516,,,,,74,+,,10.1038/nature13710,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AO2SD,WOS:000341174800032,25132552,No,,,11/20/17

It has an important role in gel formation, protein crystallization and perhaps even as an organizing principle in cellular biology(1,2). With a fewnotable exceptions(3,4), liquid-liquid phase separation in bulk proceeds through the continuous coalescence of droplets until the system undergoes complete phase separation. But when colloids, nanoparticles or proteins are confined to interfaces, surfaces or membranes, their interactions differ fundamentally from those mediated by isotropic solvents(5,6), and this results in significantly more complex phase behaviour(7-13). Here we show that liquid-liquid phase separation in monolayer membranes composed of two dissimilar chiral colloidal rods gives rise to thermodynamically stable rafts that constantly exchange monomeric rods with the background reservoir to maintain a self-limited size. We visualize and manipulate rafts to quantify their assembly kinetics and to show that membrane distortions arising from the rods' chirality lead to long-range repulsive raft-raft interactions. Rafts assemble into cluster crystals at high densities, but they can also form bonds to yield higher-order structures. Taken together, our observations demonstrate a robust membrane-based pathway for the assembly of mono-disperse membrane clusters that is complementary to existing methods for colloid assembly in bulk suspensions(14-16). They also reveal that chiral inclusions in membranes can acquire long-range repulsive interactions, which might more generally have a role in stabilizing assemblages of finite size(13,17).","[Sharma, Prerna; Ward, Andrew; Hagan, Michael F.; Dogic, Zvonimir] Brandeis Univ, Dept Phys, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Gibaud, T.] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5672, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Phys Lab, F-69007 Lyon, France","Dogic, Z (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Phys, 415 South St, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",zdogic@brandeis.edu,"Hagan, Michael/N-2177-2014; Gibaud, Thomas/D-1276-2009","Hagan, Michael/0000-0002-9211-2434; Gibaud, Thomas/0000-0003-4826-8025","US National Science Foundation [NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057]; Petroleum Research Fund [ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7]","We acknowledge discussions with R.

Short-term experiments have shown that soil microbial respiration increases exponentially with temperature(3). This information has been incorporated into soil carbon and Earth-system models, which suggest that warming-induced increases in carbon dioxide release from soils represent an important positive feedback loop that could influence twenty-first-century climate change(4). The magnitude of this feedback remains uncertain, however, not least because the response of soil microbial communities to changing temperatures has the potential to either decrease(5-7) or increase(8,9) warming-induced carbon losses substantially. Here we collect soils from different ecosystems along a climate gradient from the Arctic to the Amazon and investigate how microbial community-level responses control the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. We find that the microbial community-level response more often enhances than reduces the mid-to long-term (90 days) temperature sensitivity of respiration. Furthermore, the strongest enhancing responses were observed in soils with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and in soils from cold climatic regions. After 90 days, microbial community responses increased the temperature sensitivity of respiration in high-latitude soils by a factor of 1.4 compared to the instantaneous temperature response. This suggests that the substantial carbon stores in Arctic and boreal soils could be more vulnerable to climate warming than currently predicted.","[Karhu, Kristiina; Hartley, Iain P.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Auffret, Marc D.; Prosser, James I.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Dungait, Jennifer A.

In general(3,4), it is supposed that mantle plumes and vertical mantle flows result in axisymmetric, long-wavelength topography, which strongly differs from the generally asymmetric short-wavelength topography created by intraplate tectonic forces. However, identification of mantle-induced topography is difficult(3), especially in the continents(5). It can be argued therefore that complex brittle-ductile rheology and stratification of the continental lithosphere result in short-wavelength modulation and localization of deformation induced by mantle flow(6). This deformation should also be affected by far-field stresses and, hence, interplay with the 'tectonic' topography (for example, in the 'active/passive' rifting scenario(7,8)). Testing these ideas requires fully coupled three-dimensional numerical modelling of mantle-lithosphere interactions, which so far has not been possible owing to the conceptual and technical limitations of earlier approaches. Here we present new, ultra-high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical experiments on topography over mantle plumes, incorporating a weakly pre-stressed (ultra-slow spreading), rheologically realistic lithosphere. The results show complex surface evolution, which is very different from the smooth, radially symmetric patterns usually assumed as the canonical surface signature of mantle upwellings(9). In particular, the topography exhibits strongly asymmetric, small-scale, three-dimensional features, which include narrow and wide rifts, flexural flank uplifts and fault structures. This suggests a dominant role for continental rheological structure and intra-plate stresses in controlling dynamic topography, mantle-lithosphere interactions, and continental break-up processes above mantle plumes.","[Burov, Evgueni] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7193, Inst Sci Terre Paris ISTeP, F-75005 Paris, France; [Burov, Evgueni] CNRS, UMR 7193, Inst Sci Terre Paris ISTeP, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gerya, Taras] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Burov, E (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7193, Inst Sci Terre Paris ISTeP, F-75005 Paris, France.",evgenii.burov@upmc.fr,,,Advanced ERC grant RHEOLITH; INSU-CNRS; UPMC Invited Professor grant; ETH Invited Professor grant,"B.

RIPK1 is implicated in inflammatory and cell death signalling(9-13) and its kinase activity is believed to drive RIPK3-mediated necroptosis(14,15). Here we show that kinase-independent scaffolding RIPK1 functions regulate homeostasis and prevent inflammation in barrier tissues by inhibiting epithelial cell apoptosis and necroptosis. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific RIPK1 knockout caused IEC apoptosis, villus atrophy, loss of goblet and Paneth cells and premature death in mice. This pathology developed independently of the microbiota and of MyD88 signalling but was partly rescued by TNFR1 (also known as TNFRSF1A) deficiency. Epithelial FADD ablation inhibited IEC apoptosis and prevented the premature death of mice with IEC-specific RIPK1 knockout. However, mice lacking both RIPK1 and FADD in IECs displayed RIPK3-dependent IEC necroptosis, Paneth cell loss and focal erosive inflammatory lesions in the colon. Moreover, a RIPK1 kinase inactive knock-in delayed but did not prevent inflammation caused by FADD deficiency in IECs or keratinocytes, showing that RIPK3-dependent necroptosis of FADD-deficient epithelial cells only partly requires RIPK1 kinase activity. Epidermis-specific RIPK1 knockout triggered keratinocyte apoptosis and necroptosis and caused severe skin inflammation that was prevented by RIPK3 but not FADD deficiency. These findings revealed that RIPK1 inhibits RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in keratinocytes in vivo and identified necroptosis as a more potent trigger of inflammation compared with apoptosis. Therefore, RIPK1 is a master regulator of epithelial cell survival, homeostasis and inflammation in the intestine and the skin.","[Dannappel, Marius; Vlantis, Katerina; Kumari, Snehlata; Polykratis, Apostolos; Kim, Chun; Wachsmuth, Laurens; Eftychi, Christina; Lin, Juan; Corona, Teresa; Pasparakis, Manolis] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med CMMC, Inst Genet, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Dannappel, Marius; Vlantis, Katerina; Kumari, Snehlata; Polykratis, Apostolos; Kim, Chun; Wachsmuth, Laurens; Eftychi, Christina; Lin, Juan; Corona, Teresa; Pasparakis, Manolis] Univ Cologne, Cologne Excellence Cluster Cellular Stress Respon, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Hermance, Nicole; Zelic, Matija; Kelliher, Michelle] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Kirsch, Petra] Univ Ulm, Tierforschungszentrum, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Basic, Marijana; Bleich, Andre] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Lab Anim Sci, D-30625 Hannover, Germany","Pasparakis, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med CMMC, Inst Genet, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",pasparakis@uni-koeln.de,"Pasparakis, Manolis/H-9292-2017","Pasparakis, Manolis/0000-0002-9870-0966","European Research Council [2012-ADG_20120314]; German Research Council (DFG) [SFB670, SFB829, SPP1656]; European Commission [223404, 223151]; Deutsche Krebshilfe; Else Kroner-Fresenius-Stiftung; Helmholtz Alliance (PCCC); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases division of the National Institutes of Health [RO1AI075118]","We are grateful to V.

RIPK1 is believed to function as a node driving NF-kappa B-mediated cell survival and inflammation as well as caspase-8 (CASP8)-dependent apoptotic or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic cell death. The physiological relevance of this dual function has remained elusive because of the perinatal death of RIPK1 full knockout mice(3). To circumvent this problem, we generated RIPK1 conditional knockout mice, and show that mice lacking RIPK1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) spontaneously develop severe intestinal inflammation associated with IEC apoptosis leading to early death. This early lethality was rescued by antibiotic treatment, MYD88 deficiency or tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 deficiency, demonstrating the importance of commensal bacteria and TNF in the IEC Ripk1 knockout phenotype. CASP8 deficiency, but not RIPK3 deficiency, rescued the inflammatory phenotype completely, indicating the indispensable role of RIPK1 in suppressing CASP8-dependent apoptosis but not RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in the intestine. RIPK1 kinase-dead knock-in mice did not exhibit any sign of inflammation, suggesting that RIPK1-mediated protection resides in its kinase-independent platform function. Depletion of RIPK1 in intestinal organoid cultures sensitized them to TNF-induced apoptosis, confirming the in vivo observations. Unexpectedly, TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation remained intact in these organoids. Our results demonstrate that RIPK1 is essential for survival of IECs, ensuring epithelial homeostasis by protecting the epithelium from CASP8-mediated IEC apoptosis independently of its kinase activity and NF-kappa B activation.","[Takahashi, Nozomi; Vereecke, Lars; Bertrand, Mathieu J.

About half of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia, which impairs quality of life, limits cancer therapy and decreases survival. One key characteristic of cachexia is higher resting energy expenditure levels than in healthy individuals, which has been linked to greater thermogenesis by brown fat(1-6). How tumours induce brown fat activity is unknown. Here, using a Lewis lung carcinoma model of cancer cachexia, we show that tumour-derived parathyroid-hormone-related protein (PTHrP) has an important role in wasting, through driving the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis in adipose tissues. Neutralization of PTHrP in tumour-bearing mice blocked adipose tissue browning and the loss of muscle mass and strength. Our results demonstrate that PTHrP mediates energy wasting in fat tissues and contributes to the broader aspects of cancer cachexia. Thus, neutralization of PTHrP might hold promise for ameliorating cancer cachexia and improving patient survival.","[Kir, Serkan; White, James P.; Kleiner, Sandra; Kazak, Lawrence; Cohen, Paul; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Baracos, Vickie E.] Univ Alberta, Div Palliat Care Med, Dept Oncol, Edmonton, AB T6G 1Z2, Canada","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Baracos, Vickie/0000-0002-9609-1001",American Cancer Society [PF-13-385-01-TBE]; National Institutes of Health [DK31405],"We thank M.

All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 59 end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs(4,5). Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF(and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers.","[Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Inserm UMR981, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Univ Paris 11, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Thomas, Marina; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Gustave Roussy, Dermatooncol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Tomasic, Gorana] Gustave Roussy, Dept Pathol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Desaubry, Laurent] Strasbourg Univ, CNRS, UMR7200, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Robert, C (reprint author), Inserm UMR981, F-94805 Villejuif, France.",caroline.robert@gustaveroussy.fr; stephan.vagner@inserm.fr,,,Institut National du CAncer (INCA); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); Ligue contre le Cancer via an Integrated Research Action Program Melanoma (PAIR Melanome); Canceropole Ile de France and Ensemble Contre le Melanome; ARC; AAREC Filia Research for fellowships; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Swedish Society of Medicine,"The authors thank J.

Mutant IDH proteins in IHCC and other malignancies acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing themto convert alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits the activity of multiple alpha KG-dependent dioxygenases, and results in alterations in cell differentiation, survival, and extracellular matrix maturation(6-10). However, the molecular pathways by which IDH mutations lead to tumour formation remain unclear. Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF-4 alpha, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models expressing mutant IDH in the adult liver show an aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF-4 alpha silencing, impaired hepatocyte differentiation, and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, IDH and Kras mutations, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs4,5, cooperate to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and progression to metastatic IHCC. These studies provide a functional link between IDH mutations, hepatic cell fate, and IHCC pathogenesis, and present a novel genetically engineered mouse model of IDH-driven malignancy.","[Saha, Supriya K.; Parachoniak, Christine A.; Ghanta, Krishna S.; Fitamant, Julien; Ross, Kenneth N.; Najem, Mortada S.; Gurumurthy, Sushma; Deshpande, Vikram; Zhu, Andrew X.; Ferrone, Cristina R.; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Akbay, Esra A.; Wong, Kwok-Kin] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sia, Daniela; Cornella, Helena; Llovet, Josep M.] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Barcelona Clin Liver Canc Grp, HCC Translat Res Lab,IDIBAPS,Liver Unit, Catalonia 08036, Spain; [Sia, Daniela; Miltiadous, Oriana; Llovet, Josep M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Med, Div Liver Dis, Mt Sinai Liver Canc Program, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sia, Daniela] Natl Canc Inst, Gastrointestinal Surg & Liver Transplantat Unit, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Sia, Daniela] Dept Expt Oncol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Walesky, Chad; Apte, Udayan] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol Toxicol & Therapeut, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Hezel, Aram F.] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Yen, Katharine E.; Straley, Kimberly S.; Travins, Jeremy; Popovici-Muller, Janeta; Gliser, Camelia] Agios Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Llovet, Josep M.] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona 08010, Catalonia, Spain; [Llovet, Josep M.] Univ Barcelona, Catalonia 08036, Spain; [Ramaswamy, Sridhar] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Bardeesy, N (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",Bardeesy.Nabeel@mgh.harvard.edu,"Llovet, Josep M /D-4340-2014","Llovet, Josep M /0000-0003-0547-2667; wong, kwok kin/0000-0001-6323-235X","TargetCancer Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01CA136567-02, P50CA1270003]; Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation/Conquer Cancer Foundation of ASCO Young Investigator Award; American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship [PF-13-294-01-TBG]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research postdoctoral fellowship; Asociacion Espanola para el Estudio del Cancer; ICREA","We thank R.

Epigenetic mechanisms, and DNA methylation in particular, are hypothesized to facilitate such maintenance by creating cellular memory(1-4) that can be written during embryonic development(5,6) and then guide cell-type-specific gene expression(7). Here we develop new methods for quantitative inference of DNA methylation turnover rates, and show that human embryonic stem cells preserve their epigenetic state by balancing antagonistic processes that add and remove methylation marks rather than by copying epigenetic information from mother to daughter cells. In contrast, somatic cells transmit considerable epigenetic information to progenies. Paradoxically, the persistence of the somatic epigenome makes it more vulnerable to noise, since random epimutations can accumulate to massively perturb the epigenomic ground state. The rate of epigenetic perturbation depends on the genomic context, and, in particular, DNA methylation loss is coupled to late DNA replication dynamics. Epigenetic perturbation is not observed in the pluripotent state, because the rapid turnover-based equilibrium continuously reinforces the canonical state. This dynamic epigenetic equilibrium also explains how the epigenome can be reprogrammed quickly(8) and to near perfection(9) after induced pluripotency.","[Shipony, Zohar; Mukamel, Zohar; Cohen, Netta Mendelson; Landan, Gilad; Chomsky, Elad; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Shipony, Zohar; Mukamel, Zohar; Cohen, Netta Mendelson; Landan, Gilad; Chomsky, Elad; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Chomsky, Elad] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Zeliger, Shlomit Reich; Friedman, Nir] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Immunol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Fried, Yael Chagit; Ainbinder, Elena] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Tanay, A (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",amos.tanay@weizmann.ac.il,,,European Research Council (EVOEPIC); EU BLUEPRINT project; Israel Science Foundation [1050/12]; Israel Ministry of Science; Helen and Martin Kimmel Award,"We thank E.

However, mutagenized sequences introduced in trans on episomes or via random or ""safe-harbour'' integration fail to capture the native context of the endogenous chromosomal locus(5). This shortcoming markedly limits the interpretability of the resulting measurements of mutational impact. Here, we couple CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-guided cleavage(6) with multiplex homology-directed repair using a complex library of donor templates to demonstrate saturation editing of genomic regions. In exon 18 of BRCA1, we replace a six-base-pair (bp) genomic region with all possible hexamers, or the full exon with all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and measure strong effects on transcript abundance attributable to nonsense-mediated decay and exonic splicing elements. We similarly perform saturation genome editing of a well-conserved coding region of an essential gene, DBR1, and measure relative effects on growth that correlate with functional impact. Measurement of the functional consequences of large numbers of mutations with saturation genome editing will potentially facilitate high-resolution functional dissection of both cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors, as well as the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance observed in clinical sequencing.","[Findlay, Gregory M.; Boyle, Evan A.; Hause, Ronald J.; Klein, Jason C.; Shendure, Jay] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Shendure, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gf2@uw.edu; shendure@uw.edu,,"Shendure, Jay/0000-0002-1516-1865; Boyle, Evan/0000-0003-4494-9771",National Institutes of Health [DP1HG007811]; UW Medical Scientist Training Program,We thank F.

Novel treatments for type-2 diabetes mellitus(2) are therefore possible by targeting hGPR40 with partial or full agonists. TAK-875, or fasiglifam, is an orally available, potent and selective partial agonist(3) of hGPR40 receptor, which reached phase III clinical trials for the potential treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus(4). Data from clinical studies indicate that TAK-875, which is anago-allosteric modulator of hGPR40 (ref. 3), demonstrates improved glycaemic control and low hypoglycaemic risk in diabetic patients(5). Here we report the crystal structure of hGPR40 receptor bound to TAK-875 at 2.3 angstrom resolution. The co-complex structure reveals a unique binding mode of TAK-875 and suggests that entry to the non-canonical binding pocket most probably occurs via the lipid bilayer. The atomic details of the extensive charge network in the ligand binding pocket reveal additional interactions not identified in previous studies and contribute to a clear understanding of TAK-875 binding to the receptor. The hGPR40-TAK-875 structure also provides insights into the plausible binding of multiple ligands to the receptor, which has been observed in radioligand binding(6) and Ca2+ influx assay studies(3). Comparison of the transmembrane helix architecture with other G-protein-coupled receptors suggests that the crystallized TAK-875-bound hGPR40 complex is in an inactive-like state.","[Srivastava, Ankita; Yano, Jason; Kefala, Georgia; Gruswitz, Franz; Snell, Gyorgy; Lane, Weston; Ivetac, Anthony; Aertgeerts, Kathleen; Nguyen, Jasmine; Jennings, Andy] Takeda Calif, Dept Struct Biol & Core Sci & Technol, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Hirozane, Yoshihiko; Okada, Kengo] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Div Pharmaceut Res, Biomol Res Labs, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 2518555, Japan","Srivastava, A (reprint author), Takeda Calif, Dept Struct Biol & Core Sci & Technol, 10410 Sci Ctr Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",ankita.srivastava@takeda.com,,"Gruswitz, Franz/0000-0002-9671-6788","National Institutes of Health and National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [Y1-GM-1104]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-AC02-06CH11357]","We thank K.

The primary reaction is thought to be the fusion of two protons with the emission of a low-energy neutrino. These These so-called pp neutrinos constitute nearly the entirety of the solar neutrino flux, vastly outnumbering those emitted in the reactions that follow. Although solar neutrinos from secondary processes have been observed, proving the nuclear origin of the Sun's energy and contributing to the discovery of neutrino oscillations, those from proton-proton fusion have hitherto eluded direct detection. Here we report spectral observations of pp neutrinos, demonstrating that about 99 per cent of the Power of the Sun, 3.84 x 10(33) ergs per second, is generated by the proton-proton fusion process.","[Bellini, G.; Caccianiga, B.; D'Angelo, D.; Giammarchi, M.; Lombardi, P.; Ludhova, L.; Meroni, E.; Miramonti, L.; Ranucci, G.; Re, A.] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Fis, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Bellini, G.; Caccianiga, B.; D'Angelo, D.; Giammarchi, M.; Lombardi, P.; Ludhova, L.; Meroni, E.; Miramonti, L.; Ranucci, G.; Re, A.] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Benziger, J.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Bick, D.; Hagner, C.; Meyer, M.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Expt Phys, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Bonfini, G.; Cavalcante, P.; Chavarria, A.; Fomenke, K.; Gabriele, F.; Gazzana, S.; Ianni, Aldo; Laubenstein, M.; Lombardi, F.; Montuschi, M.; Razeto, A.; Rossi, N.; Suvorov, Y.; Tartaglia, R.] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Lab Nazl Gran Sasso, I-67100 Assergi, Italy; [Bravo, D.; Manecki, S.; Papp, L.; Vogelaar, R.

We hypothesized that AhR evolved to sense not only environmental pollutants but also microbial insults. We characterized bacterial pigmented virulence factors, namely the phenazines from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the naphthoquinone phthiocol from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as ligands of AhR Upon ligand binding, AhR activation leads to virulence factor degradation and regulated cytokine and chemokine production The relevance of AhR to host defence is underlined by heightened susceptibility of AhR-deficient mice to both P. aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis. Thus, we demonstrate that AhR senses distinct bacterial virulence factors and controls antibacterial responses, supporting a previously unidentified role for AhR as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, and identify bacterial pigments as a new class of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.","[Moura-Alves, Pedro; Fae, Kellen; Houthuys, Erica; Dorhoi, Anca; Skrahina, Tatsiana; Guhlich-Bornhof, Ute; Klemm, Marion; Koehler, Anne-Britta; Bandermann, Silke; Kaufmann, Stefan H.

Here we have identified new genes, transcripts and proteins using poly(A)(+) RNA sequencing from Drosophila melanogaster in cultured cell lines, dissected organ systems and under environmental perturbations. We found that a small set of mostly neural-specific genes has the potential to encode thousands of transcripts each through extensive alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing. The magnitudes of splicing changes are larger between tissues than between developmental stages, and most sex-specific splicing is gonad-specific. Gonads express hundreds of previously unknown coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are antisense to protein-coding genes and produce short regulatory RNAs. Furthermore, previously identified pervasive intergenic transcription occurs primarily within newly identified introns. The fly transcriptome is substantially more complex than previously recognized, with this complexity arising from combinatorial usage of promoters splice sites and polyaclenylation sites.","[Brown, James B.; Boley, Nathan; Stoiber, Marcus H.; Robinson, Garret; Hernandez, Juan; Bickel, Peter J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Brown, James B.; Booth, Ben W.; Park, Soo; Wan, Kenneth H.; Yu, Charles; Carlson, Joseph W.; Frise, Erwin; Hammonds, Ann S.; Weiszmann, Richard; Hoskins, Roger A.; Celniker, Susan E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Genome Dynam, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eisman, Robert; Cherbas, Lucy; Eads, Brian D.; Miller, David; Mockaitis, Keithanne; Andrews, Justen; Cherbas, Peter; Kaufman, Thomas C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [May, Gemma E.; Duff, Michael O.; Olson, Sara; Graveley, Brenton R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Inst Syst Genom, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Wen, Jiayu; Shenker, Sol; Lai, Eric C.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Rockefeller Res Labs 1017C, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Suzuki, Ana Maria; Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Omics Sci Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Suzuki, Ana Maria; Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Ctr Life Sci Technol, Div Genom Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Zhang, Dayu; Roberts, Johnny; Cherbas, Peter] Indiana Univ, Ctr Genom & Bioinformat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Davis, Carrie A.; Gingeras, Thomas R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Sturgill, David; Oliver, Brian] NIDDK, Sect Dev Genom, Lab Cellular & Dev Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Samsonova, Anastasia A.; Perrimon, Norbert] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Samsonova, Anastasia A.; Perrimon, Norbert] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Brown, JB (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",benbrownofberkeley@gmail.com; graveley@neuron.uchc.edu; celniker@fruitfly.org,"Brown, James/H-2971-2015; Carninci, Piero/K-1568-2014; Samsonova, Anastasia/Q-7591-2016; Graveley, Brenton/C-3108-2013; Wen, Jiayu/R-1673-2017","Carninci, Piero/0000-0001-7202-7243; Samsonova, Anastasia/0000-0002-9353-9173; Wen, Jiayu/0000-0003-1249-6456; Gingeras, Thomas/0000-0001-9106-3573; Graveley, Brenton/0000-0001-5777-5892; Perrimon, Norbert/0000-0001-7542-472X","National Human Genome Research Institute; Department of Energy [U01 HG004271, U54 HG006944, R01 GM076655, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NHGRI [K99 HG006698]; modENCODE DAC sub-award [5710003102, 1U01HG007031-01]; ENCODE DAC [5U01HG004695-04]; Indiana METACyt Initiative of Indiana University - Lilly Endowment;  [U01-HG004261];  [RC2-HG005639]","We thank the members of the modENCODE transcription consortium, especially J.

The explosion fuses a large amount of radioactive Ni-56 (refs 1-3). After the explosion, the decay chain from Ni-56 to Co-56 to Fe-56 generates gamma-ray photons, which are reprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission. Here we report the detection of Co-56 lines at energies of 847 and 1,238 kiloelectronvolts and a gamma-ray continuum in the 200-400 kiloelectronvolt band from the type Ia supernova 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of radioactive Ni-56 were synthesized during the explosion. The line broadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of 10,000 +/- 3,000 kilometres per second. The observed gamma-ray properties are in broad agreement with the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not exclude merger scenarios that fuse comparable amounts of Ni-56.","[Churazov, E.; Sunyaev, R.; Grebenev, S.; Sazonov, S.] Space Res Inst IKI, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Churazov, E.; Sunyaev, R.] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Isern, J.] Inst Space Sci ICE CSIC IEEC, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Knoedlseder, J.; Jean, P.] Univ Toulouse, UPS OMP, IRAP, Toulouse, France; [Knoedlseder, J.; Jean, P.] CNRS, IRAP, F-31028 Toulouse 4, France; [Lebrun, F.] Univ Paris Diderot, APC, CNRS IN2P3, Observ Paris,Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Chugai, N.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Astron, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Bravo, E.] Univ Politecn Cataluna, ETSAV, Sant Cugat Del Valles 08173, Spain; [Sazonov, S.] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Russia; [Renaud, M.] Univ Montpellier 2, LUPM, CNRS IN2P3, CC 72, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France","Churazov, E (reprint author), Space Res Inst IKI, Profsouznaya 84-32, Moscow 117997, Russia.",churazov@mpa-garching.mpg.de,"Isern, Jordi/B-1844-2015; Churazov, Eugene/A-7783-2013; Bravo, Eduardo/P-1500-2017","Isern, Jordi/0000-0002-0819-9574; Bravo, Eduardo/0000-0003-0894-6450",ESA; Russian Scientific Foundation [14-22-00271]; MINECO-FEDER; Generalitat de Catalunya; CNES,"This work was based on observations with INTEGRAL, an ESA project with instruments and a science data centre funded by ESA member states (especially the principal investigator countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain) and with the participation of Russia and the United States.

In particular, quantum interference occurs only if there exists no information to distinguish between the superposed states. The mere possibility of obtaining information that could distinguish between overlapping states inhibits quantum interference(1,2). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a quantum imaging concept based on induced coherence without induced emission(3,4). Our experiment uses two separate down-conversion nonlinear crystals (numbered NL1 and NL2), each illuminated by the same pump laser, creating one pair of photons (denoted idler and signal). If the photon pair is created in NL1, one photon (the idler) passes through the object to be imaged and is overlapped with the idler amplitude created in NL2, its source thus being undefined. Interference of the signal amplitudes coming from the two crystals then reveals the image of the object. The photons that pass through the imaged object (idler photons from NL1) are never detected, while we obtain images exclusively with the signal photons (from NL1 and NL2), which do not interact with the object. Our experiment is fundamentally different from previous quantum imaging techniques, such as interaction-free imaging(5) or ghostimaging(6-9), because now the photons used to illuminate the object do not have to be detected at all and no coincidence detection is necessary. This enables the probe wavelength to be chosen in a range for which suitable detectors are not available. To illustrate this, we show images of objects that are either opaque or invisible to the detected photons. Our experiment is a prototype in quantum information-knowledge can be extracted by, and about, a photon that is never detected.","[Lemos, Gabriela Barreto; Borish, Victoria; Ramelow, Sven; Lapkiewicz, Radek; Zeilinger, Anton] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lemos, Gabriela Barreto; Cole, Garrett D.; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol VCQ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Borish, Victoria; Cole, Garrett D.; Ramelow, Sven; Lapkiewicz, Radek; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Lemos, GB (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat, Boltzmanngasse 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",gabriela.barreto.lemos@univie.ac.at; anton.zeilinger@univie.ac.at,"Lapkiewicz, Radek/B-5786-2015; Barreto Lemos, Gabriela/E-6884-2015; Ramelow, Sven/H-6798-2012","Barreto Lemos, Gabriela/0000-0003-4901-0309; Ramelow, Sven/0000-0002-7801-4440; Cole, Garrett/0000-0001-7149-3218","Austrian Academy of Sciences (OAW) through Vienna Center for Science and Technology (VCQ); EU Marie Curie Fellowship [PIOF-GA-2012-329851]; OAW; European Research Council (ERC) [227844, 600645]","We thank M.

Carbon-carbon bonds are quite stable and are consequently unreactive under many reaction conditions. In the industrial naphtha hydrocracking process, the aromatic carbon skeleton of benzene can be transformed to methylcyclopentane and acyclic saturated hydrocarbons through C-C bond cleavage and rearrangement on the surfaces of solid catalysts(1-6). However, these chemical transformations usually require high temperatures and are fairly non-selective. Microorganisms can degrade aromatic compounds under ambient conditions, but the mechanistic details are not known and are difficult to mimic(7). Several transition metal complexes have been reported to cleave C-C bonds in a selective fashion in special circumstances, such as relief of ring strain, formation of an aromatic system, chelation-assisted cyclometallation and beta-carbon elimination(8-15). However, the cleavage of benzene by a transition metal complex has not been reported(16-19). Here we report the C-C bond cleavage and rearrangement of benzene by a trinuclear titanium poly-hydride complex. The benzene ring is transformed sequentially to a methylcyclopentenyl and a 2-methylpentenyl species through the cleavage of the aromatic carbon skeleton at the multi-titanium sites. Our results suggest that multinuclear titanium hydrides could serve as a unique platform for the activation of aromatic molecules, and may facilitate the design of new catalysts for the transformation of inactive aromatics.","[Hu, Shaowei; Shima, Takanori; Hou, Zhaomin] RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Adv Catalysis Res Grp, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Shima, Takanori; Hou, Zhaomin] RIKEN, Organometall Chem Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Hou, ZM (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Adv Catalysis Res Grp, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",houz@riken.jp,"Hu, Shaowei/C-7982-2017; Shima, Takanori /C-8166-2017; Hou, Zhaomin/I-5981-2014","Shima, Takanori /0000-0003-1813-0439; Hou, Zhaomin/0000-0003-2841-5120","JSPS [26810041, 26410082, 26220802]; RIKEN","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (no. 26810041), a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (no. 26410082) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) (no. 26220802) from JSPS, and an Incentive Research Grant from RIKEN.

Both mean snowfall and the intensity distribution of snowfall are important, with heavy snowfall events having particularly large economic and human impacts(5-7). Simulations with climate models indicate that annual mean snowfall declines with warming in most regions but increases in regions with very low surface temperatures(3,4). The response of heavy snowfall events to a changing climate, however, is unclear. Here I show that in simulations with climate models under a scenario of high emissions of greenhouse gases, by the late twenty-first century there are smaller fractional changes in the intensities of daily snowfall extremes than in mean snowfall overmany Northern Hemisphere land regions. For example, for monthly climatological temperatures just below freezing and surface elevations below 1,000 metres, the 99.99th percentile of daily snowfall decreases by 8% in the multimodel median, compared to a 65% reduction in mean snowfall. Both mean and extreme snowfall must decrease for a sufficiently large warming, but the climatological temperature above which snowfall extremes decrease with warming in the simulations is as high as -9 degrees C, compared to -14 degrees C for mean snowfall. These results are supported by a physically based theory that is consistent with the observed rain-snow transition. According to the theory, snowfall extremes occur near an optimal temperature that is insensitive to climate warming, and this results in smaller fractional changes for higher percentiles of daily snowfall. The simulated changes in snowfall that I find would influence surface snow and its hazards; these changes also suggest that it may be difficult to detect a regional climate-change signal in snowfall extremes.","MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","O'Gorman, PA (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pog@mit.edu,,,NSF [AGS-1148594]; NASA ROSES [09-IDS09-0049],"I thank M.

Owing to the rarity of some of these forms and a general lack of comparative material from other deposits, interpretations of various features remain controversial(3,4), as do their wider relationships amongst post-Cambrian early un-skeletonized jawless vertebrates. Here we redescribe Metaspriggina(5) on the basis of new material from the Burgess Shale and exceptionally preserved material collected near Marble Canyon, British Columbia(6), and three other Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits from Laurentia. This primitive fish displays unambiguous vertebrate features: a notochord, a pair of prominent camera-type eyes, paired nasal sacs, possible cranium and arcualia, W-shaped myomeres, and a post-anal tail. A striking feature is the branchial area with an array of bipartite bars. Apart from the anterior most bar, which appears to be slightly thicker, each is associated with externally located gills, possibly housed in pouches. Phylogenetic analysis places Metaspriggina as a basal vertebrate, apparently close to the Chengjiang taxa Haikouichthys(1-4) and Myllokunmingia(1), demonstrating also that this primitive group of fish was cosmopolitan during Lower-Middle Cambrian times (Series 2-3). However, the arrangement of the branchial region in Metaspriggina has wider implications for reconstructing the morphology of the primitive vertebrate. Each bipartite bar is identified as being respectively equivalent to an epibranchial and ceratobranchial. This configuration suggests that a bipartite arrangement is primitive and reinforces the view that the branchial basket of lampreys(7) is probably derived. Other features of Metaspriggina, including the external position of the gills and possible absence of a gill opposite the more robust anterior-most bar, are characteristic of gnathostomes(8) and so may be primitive within vertebrates.","[Morris, Simon Conway] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Morris, SC (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.",sc113@cam.ac.uk; jcaron@rom.on.ca,,"Caron, Jean-Bernard/0000-0002-1670-5502","Department of Earth Sciences and St John's College, Cambridge; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [341944]; Royal Ontario Museum [53]","We thank T.

As some behaviours are easier to learn than others(1,2), we asked if some neural activity patterns are easier to generate than others. Here we investigate whether an existing network constrains the patterns that a subset of its neurons is capable of exhibiting, and if so, what principles define this constraint. We employed a closed-loop intracortical brain-computer interface learning paradigm in which Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) controlled a computer cursor by modulating neural activity patterns in the primary motor cortex. Using the brain-computer interface paradigm, we could specify and alter how neural activity mapped to cursor velocity. At the start of each session, we observed the characteristic activity patterns of the recorded neural population. The activity of a neural population can be represented in a high-dimensional space (termed the neural space), wherein each dimension corresponds to the activity of one neuron. These characteristic activity patterns comprise a low-dimensional subspace (termed the intrinsic manifold) within the neural space. The intrinsic manifold presumably reflects constraints imposed by the underlying neural circuitry. Here we show that the animals could readily learn to proficiently control the cursor using neural activity patterns that were within the intrinsic manifold. However, animals were less able to learn to proficiently control the cursor using activity patterns that were outside of the intrinsic manifold. These results suggest that the existing structure of a network can shape learning. On a timescale of hours, it seems to be difficult to learn to generate neural activity patterns that are not consistent with the existing network structure. These findings offer a network-level explanation for the observation that we are more readily able to learn new skills when they are related to the skills that we already possess(3,4).","[Sadtler, Patrick T.; Quick, Kristin M.; Tyler-Kabara, Elizabeth C.; Batista, Aaron P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Bioengn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Sadtler, Patrick T.; Quick, Kristin M.; Golub, Matthew D.; Chase, Steven M.; Yu, Byron M.; Batista, Aaron P.] Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sadtler, Patrick T.; Quick, Kristin M.; Batista, Aaron P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Syst Neurosci Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Golub, Matthew D.; Yu, Byron M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Chase, Steven M.; Yu, Byron M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Ryu, Stephen I.] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ryu, Stephen I.] Palo Alto Med Fdn, Dept Neurosurg, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA; [Tyler-Kabara, Elizabeth C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Tyler-Kabara, Elizabeth C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Yu, BM (reprint author), Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",byronyu@cmu.edu; apb10@pitt.edu,"Tyler-Kabara, Elizabeth/H-4930-2013","Tyler-Kabara, Elizabeth/0000-0003-3286-1094; Golub, Matthew/0000-0003-4508-0537; Chase, Steven/0000-0003-4450-6313; Batista, Aaron/0000-0002-1719-0061",NIH NICHD CRCNS [R01-HD071686]; NIH NINDS [R01-NS065065]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NSF [DGE-0549352]; NIH [P30-NS076405],"We thank A.

An influential model, the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator(1), relies on differential temporal filtering of two spatially separated input channels, delaying one input signal with respect to the other. Motion in a particular direction causes these delayed and non-delayed luminance signals to arrive simultaneously at a subsequent processing step in the brain; these signals are then nonlinearly amplified to produce a direction-selective response. Recent work in Drosophila has identified two parallel pathways that selectively respond to either moving light or dark edges(2,3). Each of these pathways requires two critical processing steps to be applied to incoming signals: differential delay between the spatial input channels, and distinct processing of brightness increment and decrement signals. Here we demonstrate, using in vivo patch-clamp recordings, that four medulla neurons implement these two processing steps. The neurons Mi1 and Tm3 respond selectively to brightness increments, with the response of Mi1 delayed relative to Tm3. Conversely, Tm1 and Tm2 respond selectively to brightness decrements, with the response of Tm1 delayed compared with Tm2. Remarkably, constraining Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator models using these measurements produces outputs consistent with previously measured properties of motion detectors, including temporal frequency tuning and specificity for light versus dark edges. We propose that Mi1 and Tm3 perform critical processing of the delayed and non-delayed input channels of the correlator responsible for the detection of light edges, while Tm1 and Tm2 play analogous roles in the detection of moving dark edges. Our data show that specific medulla neurons possess response properties that allow them to implement the algorithmic steps that precede the correlative operation in the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, revealing elements of the long-sought neural substrates of motion detection in the fly.","[Behnia, Rudy; Desplan, Claude] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Clark, Damon A.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Clark, Damon A.; Clandinin, Thomas R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Carter, Adam G.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Desplan, Claude] New York Univ Abu Dhabi Inst, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Behnia, R (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA.",rb141@nyu.edu; damon.clark@yale.edu,,"Clark, Damon/0000-0001-8487-700X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01EY017916]; New York University Abu Dhabi Institute [G1205C]; EMBO; Human Frontier Science Program; NIH [R01EY022638, DP1 OD003530]; NIH; Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellowship; McKnight Foundation","We thank G.

MicroRNAs play important roles in physiology and disease(4,5), and present tremendous therapeutic potential(6). Nonetheless, how microRNAs regulate skeletal biology is underexplored. Here we identify miR-34a as a novel and critical suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche. miR-34a is downregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclastic miR-34a-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit lower bone resorption and higher bone mass. Conversely, miR-34a knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit elevated bone resorption and reduced bone mass. Consequently, ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, as well as bone metastasis of breast and skin cancers, are diminished in osteoclastic miR-34a transgenic mice, and can be effectively attenuated by miR-34a nanoparticle treatment. Mechanistically, we identify transforming growth factor-beta-induced factor 2 (Tgif2) as an essential direct miR-34a target that is pro-osteoclastogenic. Tgif2 deletion reduces bone resorption and abolishes miR-34a regulation. Together, using mouse genetic, pharmacological and disease models, we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor and a potential therapeutic strategy to confer skeletal protection and ameliorate bone metastasis of cancers.","[Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Mendell, Joshua T.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Lin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mol & Cell Biol Dept, Div Cellular & Dev Biol, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Reprod Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr RNA Interference & Noncoding RNA, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Wan, YH (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",yihong.wan@utsouthwestern.edu,,,"CPRIT [RP130145, R1008]; DOD [BC122877]; National Institutes of Health [R01 DK089113, R01 CA120185, P01 CA134292, U54 CA151668, UH2 TR000943, R01 CA139067]; Welch Foundation [I-1751]; University of Texas Southwestern Endowed Scholar Startup Fund; Harold C.

Although R genes often fail to provide durable resistance in an agricultural context, they frequently persist as long-lived balanced polymorphisms in nature(2-4). Standard theory explains the maintenance of such polymorphisms through a balance of the costs and benefits of resistance and virulence in a tightly coevolving host-pathogen pair(5,6). However, many plant-pathogen interactions lack such specificity(7). Whether, and how, balanced polymorphisms are maintained in diffusely interacting species(8) is unknown. Here we identify a naturally interacting R gene and effector pair in Arabidopsis thaliana and its facultative plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. The protein encoded by the R gene RPS5 recognizes an AvrPphB homologue (AvrPphB2) and exhibits a balanced polymorphism that has been maintained for over 2 million years (ref. 3). Consistent with the presence of an ancient balanced polymorphism, the R gene confers a benefit when plants are infected with P. syringae carrying avrPphB2 but also incurs a large cost in the absence of infection. RPS5 alleles are maintained at intermediate frequencies in populations globally, suggesting ubiquitous selection for resistance. However, the presence of P. syringae carrying avrPphB is probably insufficient to explain the RPS5 polymorphism. First, avrPphB homologues occur at very low frequencies in P. syringae populations on A. thaliana. Second, AvrPphB only rarely confers a virulence benefit to P. syringae on A. thaliana. Instead, we find evidence that selection for RPS5 involves multiple non-homologous effectors and multiple pathogen species. These results and an associated model suggest that the R gene polymorphism in A. thaliana may not be maintained through a tightly coupled interaction involving a single coevolved R gene and effector pair. More likely, the stable polymorphism is maintained through complex and diffuse community-wide interactions.","[Karasov, Talia L.; Kniskern, Joel M.; Gao, Liping; Ding, Jing; Lastra, Ruben O.; Nallu, Sumitha; Barrett, Luke G.; Hudson, Richard R.; Bergelson, Joy] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Karasov, Talia L.] Univ Chicago, Comm Genet Genom & Syst Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [DeYoung, Brody J.; Dubiella, Ullrich; Innes, Roger W.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Roux, Fabrice] INRA, LIPM, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Roux, Fabrice] CNRS, LIPM, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Roux, Fabrice] Univ Sci & Technol Lille Lille 1, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, UMR CNRS 8198, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Bergelson, J (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 940 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jbergels@uchicago.edu,"Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015; Nallu, Sumitha/D-5382-2017","Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731; Dubiella, Ullrich/0000-0001-9854-9795; Fabrice, Roux/0000-0001-8059-5638; Innes, Roger/0000-0001-9634-1413; Karasov, Talia/0000-0002-3592-6597","Department of Education GAANN fellowship; Dropkin Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program award; Laboratory of Excellence (Labex) TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02]; NIH-NIGMS [R01 GM046451, R01 GM057994, R01 GM083068]; NSF [MCB0603515]","We thank G.

Before insertion, the carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains of tail-anchored proteins are shielded in the cytosol by the conserved targeting factor Get3 (in yeast; TRC40 inmammals)(5-7). The Get3 endoplasmic-reticulum receptor comprises the cytosolic domains of the Get1/2 (WRB/CAML) transmembrane complex, which interact individually with the targeting factor to drive a conformational change that enables substrate release and, as a consequence, insertion(8-11). Because tail-anchored protein insertion is not associated with significant translocation of hydrophilic protein sequences across the membrane, it remains possible that Get1/2 cytosolic domains are sufficient to place Get3 in proximity with the endoplasmic-reticulum lipid bilayer and permit spontaneous insertion to occur(12,13). Here we use cell reporters and biochemical reconstitution to define mutations in the Get1/2 transmembrane domain that disrupt tail-anchored protein insertion without interfering with Get1/2 cytosolic domain function. These mutations reveal a novel Get1/2 insertase function, in the absence of which substrates stay bound to Get3 despite their proximity to the lipid bilayer; as a consequence, the notion of spontaneous transmembrane domain insertion is a non sequitur. Instead, the Get1/2 transmembrane domain helps to release substrates from Get3 by capturing their transmembrane domains, and these transmembrane interactions define a bona fide pre-integrated intermediate along a facilitated route for tail-anchor entry into the lipid bilayer. Our work sheds light on the fundamental point of convergence between co-translational and post-translational endoplasmic-reticulum membrane protein targeting and insertion: a mechanism for reducing the ability of a targeting factor to shield its substrates enables substrate handover to a transmembrane-domain-docking site embedded in the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane.","[Wang, Fei; Chan, Charlene; Weir, Nicholas R.; Denic, Vladimir] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Northwest Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Denic, V (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Northwest Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",vdenic@mcb.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [RO1GM0999943-01]; Sara Elizabeth O'Brien Trust Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, Bank of America","We thank O.

Identifying common features in it across distant species can reveal fundamental principles. To this end, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have generated large amounts of matched RNA-sequencing data for human, worm and fly. Uniform processing and comprehensive annotation of these data allow comparison across metazoan phyla, extending beyond earlier within-phylum transcriptome comparisons and revealing ancient, conserved features(1-6). Specifically, we discover co-expression modules shared across animals, many of which are enriched in developmental genes. Moreover, we use expression patterns to align the stages in worm and fly development and find a novel pairing between worm embryo and fly pupae, in addition to the embryo-to-embryo and larvae-to-larvae pairings. Furthermore, we find that the extent of non-canonical, non-coding transcription is similar in each organism, per base pair. Finally, we find in all three organisms that the gene-expression levels, both coding and non-coding, can be quantitatively predicted from chromatin features at the promoter using a 'universal model' based on a single set of organism-independent parameters.","[Gerstein, Mark B.; Rozowsky, Joel; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Wang, Daifeng; Sisu, Cristina; Pei, Baikang; Harmanci, Arif O.; Alexander, Roger P.; Auerbach, Raymond; Fang, Gang; Kitchen, Robert R.; Leng, Ling; Mortazavi, Ali; Sethi, Anurag; Zhang, Yan; Zheng, Henry] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gerstein, Mark B.; Rozowsky, Joel; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Wang, Daifeng; Sisu, Cristina; Pei, Baikang; Harmanci, Arif O.; Alexander, Roger P.; Auerbach, Raymond; Fang, Gang; Kitchen, Robert R.; Leng, Ling; Mortazavi, Ali; Sethi, Anurag; Zhang, Yan; Zheng, Henry] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gerstein, Mark B.] Yale Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Cheng, Chao] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Genet, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Cheng, Chao] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Inst Quantitat Biomed Sci, Norris Cotton Canc Ctr, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA; [Brown, James B.; Boley, Nathan P.; Booth, Benjamin W.; Hammonds, Ann; Hoskins, Roger A.; Stoiber, Marcus H.; Wan, Kenneth H.; Ceniker, Susan E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Genome Dynam, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Brown, James B.; Li, Jingyi Jessica; Bickel, Peter J.; Huang, Haiyan; Robinson, Garrett] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Carrie A.; Bell, Kimberly; Dobins, Alex; Drenkows, Jorg; Fastucas, Megan; Jhas, Sonali; Schlesingers, Felix; Wang, Huaien; Xue, Chenghai; Zaleskis, Chris; Gingeras, Thomas R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Hillier, LaDeana; Boeck, Max E.; Ewing, Brent; Huynh, Chau; MacCoss, Michael; Merrihew, Gennifer; Strasbourger, Pnina; Thompson, Owen A.; Waterston, Robert] Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hillier, LaDeana; Boeck, Max E.; Ewing, Brent; Huynh, Chau; MacCoss, Michael; Merrihew, Gennifer; Strasbourger, Pnina; Thompson, Owen A.; Waterston, Robert] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Li, Jingyi Jessica] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Li, Jingyi Jessica] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Duff, Michael O.; May, Gemma; Olson, Sara; Yang, Li; Graveley, Brenton R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Inst Syst Genom, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Djebali, Sarah; Guigo, Roderic; Lagarde, Julien; Pervouchine, Dmitri] Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Djebali, Sarah; Guigo, Roderic; Lagarde, Julien; Pervouchine, Dmitri] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Ciencies Expt Salut, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Alver, Burak H.; Park, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biomed Informat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Boley, Nathan P.; Stoiber, Marcus H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cherbas, Lucy; Cherbas, Peter; Kaufman, Thomas C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Cherbas, Lucy; Cherbas, Peter] Indiana Univ, Ctr Genom & Bioinformat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Di, Chao; Gao, Guanjun; Hu, Long; Lu, Zhi; Wen, Kejia] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Bioinformat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Feingold, Elise A.; Good, Peter J.; Pazin, Michael J.] NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Frankish, Adam; Harrow, Jen; Hubbard, Tim J.

Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed substantially to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function in humans, and have revealed conservation of chromatin components and mechanisms(1-3). Nevertheless, the three organisms have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal chromosomal 'arms', and centromeres distributed along their lengths(4,5). To systematically investigate chromatin organization and associated gene regulation across species, we generated and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and human. Here we present over 800 new data sets from our ENCODE and modENCODE consortia, bringing the total to over 1,400. Comparison of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications, nuclear lamina-associated domains, organization of large-scale topological domains, chromatin environment at promoters and enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and DNA replication patterns reveals many conserved features of chromatin organization among the three organisms. We also find notable differences in the composition and locations of repressive chromatin. These data sets and analyses provide a rich resource for comparative and species-specific investigations of chromatin composition, organization and function.","[Ho, Joshua W.

Although studies of individual elements and factors have explored similarities in gene regulation, a large-scale comparative analysis of basic principles of transcriptional regulatory features is lacking. Here we map the genome-wide binding locations of 165 human, 93 worm and 52 fly transcription regulatory factors, generating a total of 1,019 data sets from diverse cell types, developmental stages, or conditions in the three species, of which 498 (48.9%) are presented here for the first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are remarkably conserved and that orthologous regulatory factor families recognize similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for individual factors are general principles of metazoan regulation that are remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here will drive an improved understanding of the regulatory underpinnings of model organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development and disease.","[Boyle, Alan P.; Araya, Carlos L.; Brdlik, Cathleen; Cayting, Philip; Cheng, Yong; Jiang, Lixia; Kawli, Trupti; Xie, Dan; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cheng, Chao; Rozowsky, Joel; Wang, Daifeng; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Gerstein, Mark] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gardner, Kathryn; Janette, Judith; Kasper, Dionna; Niu, Wei; Reinke, Valerie] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Hillier, LaDeana W.; Ma, Lijia; Terrell, Robert; Vafeados, Dionne; Waterston, Robert H.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kheradpour, Pouya; Kundaje, Anshul; Wu, Yi-Chieh; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Li, Jingyi Jessica; Huang, Haiyan; Bickel, Peter J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Jingyi Jessica] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Rehm, E.

Here we describe a -1 PRF signal in the human mRNA encoding CCR5, the HIV-1 co-receptor. CCR5 mRNA-mediated -1 PRF is directed by an mRNA pseudoknot, and is stimulated by at least two microRNAs. Mapping the mRNA-miRNA interaction suggests that formation of a triplex RNA structure stimulates -1 PRF. A -1 PRF event on the CCR5 mRNA directs translating ribosomes to a premature termination codon, destabilizing it through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. At least one additional mRNA decay pathway is also involved. Functional -1 PRF signals that seem to be regulated by miRNAs are also demonstrated in mRNAs encoding six other cytokine receptors, suggesting a novel mode through which immune responses may be fine-tuned in mammalian cells.","[Belew, Ashton Trey; Meskauskas, Arturas; Musalgaonkar, Sharmishtha; Advani, Vivek M.; Sulima, Sergey O.; Dinman, Jonathan D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Meskauskas, Arturas] Vilnius State Univ, Dept Biotechnol & Microbiol, LT-03101 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kasprzak, Wojciech K.] Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Basic Sci Program, Frederick Natl Lab Canc Res, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Shapiro, Bruce A.] NCI, Basic Res Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Dinman, JD (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dinman@umd.edu,,"Dinman, Jonathan/0000-0002-2402-9698","National Institutes of Health [5 R01GM058859, R21GM068123]; National Science Foundation [MCB-0084559]; University of Maryland College of CMNS Hockmeyer Fellowship; NIH/NIGMS [T32GM080201]; Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, NIH [HHSN261200800001E]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, Center for Cancer Research;  [NIH/NIAIDT32AI051967]","This work was supported by grants to J.D.D. from the National Institutes of Health (5 R01GM058859, R21GM068123) and from the National Science Foundation(MCB-0084559).

A decline in GABA(A)R signalling triggers hyperactive neurological disorders such as insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a GABA(A)R, the human beta 3homopentamer, at 3 angstrom resolution. This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABA(A)R modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state. These results offer new insights into the signalling mechanisms of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and enhance current understanding of GABAergic neurotransmission.","[Miller, Paul S.; Aricescu, A.

The molecular processes of neurotransmitter binding, subsequent opening of the ion channel and ion permeation remain poorly understood. Here we present the X-ray structure of a mammalian Cys-loop receptor, the mouse serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, at 3.5 angstrom resolution. The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 angstrom constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops. This 5-HT3 receptor structure, revealing part of the intracellular domain, expands the structural basis for understanding the operating mechanism of mammalian Cys-loop receptors.","[Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Chem Polymers & Membranes, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Ctr Cellular Imaging & NanoAnalyt, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Tomizaki, Takashi] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5234 Villigen, Switzerland; [Desmyter, Aline] CNRS, UMR 7257, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Desmyter, Aline] Univ Aix Marseille, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CNRS, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CEA, DSV, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Li, Xiao-Dan] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Biomol Res, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Poitevin, Frederic] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, UMR3528, Unite Dynam Struct Macromol, F-75015 Paris, France","Nury, H (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Chem Polymers & Membranes, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",horst.vogel@epfl.ch; hugues.nury@ibs.fr,"Poitevin, Frederic/K-1718-2014; MOREAU, Christophe/D-3736-2009; Hovius, Ruud/B-5647-2009; Stahlberg, Henning/H-1868-2011","MOREAU, Christophe/0000-0002-5463-9593; Hovius, Ruud/0000-0001-9258-6587; Stahlberg, Henning/0000-0002-1185-4592",Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-133141]; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; European Community [211800]; Human Frontier Science Program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (VenomPicoScreen project) [ANR-11-RPIB-022-04],"Research in the laboratory of H.

This picture has been challenged by the discovery of a dense and almost static shell(5) that is three times closer to the star than the bow shock and has been decelerated by some external force. The two physically distinct structures cannot both be formed by the hydrodynamic interaction of the wind with the interstellar medium. Here we report that a model in which Betelgeuse's wind is photoionized by radiation from external sources can explain the static shell without requiring a new understanding of the bow shock. Pressure from the photoionized wind generates a standing shock in the neutral part of the wind6 and forms an almost static, photoionization-confined shell. Other red supergiants should have much more massive shells than Betelgeuse, because the photoionization-confined shell traps up to 35 per cent of all mass lost during the red supergiant phase, confining this gas close to the star until it explodes. After the supernova explosion, massive shells dramatically affect the supernova light curve, providing a natural explanation for the many supernovae that have signatures of circumstellar interaction.","[Mackey, Jonathan; Langer, Norbert; Meyer, Dominique M-A; Moriya, Takashi J.] Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Mohamed, Shazrene] S African Astron Observ, ZA-7935 Observatory, South Africa; [Gvaramadze, Vasilii V.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Sternberg Astron Inst, Moscow 119992, Russia; [Gvaramadze, Vasilii V.] Isaac Newton Inst Chile, Moscow Branch, Moscow 119992, Russia; [Gvaramadze, Vasilii V.] Russian Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Kotak, Rubina] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Math & Phys, Astrophys Res Ctr, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Neilson, Hilding R.] E Tennessee State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Johnson City, TN 37614 USA","Mackey, J (reprint author), Argelander Inst Astron, Hugel 71, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",jmackey@astro.uni-bonn.de,,"Kotak, Rubina/0000-0001-5455-3653; Mackey, Jonathan/0000-0002-5449-6131; Neilson, Hilding/0000-0002-7322-7236",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [1573]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26.51]; NSF [AST-0807664]; STFC [ST/L000709/1],"J.M. and S.

The most used technique in cold-atomphysics is the magneto-optical trap (MOT), which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from radiation pressure. For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture and cool large numbers of particles to ultracold temperatures (less than similar to 1 millikelvin); this has enabled advances in areas that range fromoptical clocks to the study of ultracold collisions, while also serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. The additional degrees of freedom associated with the vibration and rotation of molecules, particularly their permanent electric dipole moments, allow a broad array of applications not possible with ultracold atoms(1). Spurred by these ideas, a variety of methods has been developed to create ultracold molecules. Temperatures below 1 microkelvin have been demonstrated for diatomic molecules assembled from pre-cooled alkali atoms(2,3), but for the wider range of species amenable to direct cooling and trapping, only recently have temperatures below 100 millikelvin been achieved(4,5). The complex internal structure of molecules complicates magneto-optical trapping. However, ideas and methods necessary for creating a molecular MOT have been developed(6-11) recently. Here we demonstrate three dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 millikelvin, the lowest yet achieved by direct cooling of a molecule. This method is a straightforward extension of atomic techniques and is expected to be viable for a significant number of diatomic species(6,7). With further development, we anticipate that this techniquemay be employed in any number of existing and proposed molecular experiments, in applications ranging from precision measurement(12) to quantum simulation(13) and quantum information(14) to ultracold chemistry(15).","[Barry, J.

This ubiquitous feature of rapid glacial climate change can be extended back as far as 800,000 years before present (BP) in the ice core record(2), and has drawn broad attention within the science and policy-making communities alike(3). Many studies have been dedicated to investigating the underlying causes of these changes, but no coherent mechanism has yet been identified(3-15). Here we show, by using a comprehensive fully coupled model(16), that gradual changes in the height of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (NHISs) canalter the coupled atmosphere ocean system and cause rapid glacial climate shifts closely resembling DO events. The simulated global climate responses-including abrupt warming in the North Atlantic, a northward shift of the tropical rain-belts, and Southern Hemisphere cooling related to the bipolar seesa ware generally consistent with empirical evidence(1,3,17). As a result of the coexistence of two glacial ocean circulation states at intermediate heights of the ice sheets, minor changes in the height of the NHISs and the amount of atmospheric CO2 can trigger the rapid climate transitions via a local positive atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice feedback in the North Atlantic. Our results, although based on a single model, thus provide a coherent concept for understanding the recorded millennial scale variability and abrupt climate changes in the coupled atmosphere ocean system, as well as their linkages to the volume of the intermediate ice sheets during glacials.","[Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales","Zhang, X (reprint author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",xu.zhang@awi.de,,"Lohmann, Gerrit/0000-0003-2089-733X","Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) programme of the AWI; 'Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM' (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project of the Helmholtz Association of German research centres (HGF)","We thank the colleagues in the Paleoclimate Dynamics group at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven for useful discussions, and I.

It has successfully explained past earthquakes (see, for example, ref. 2) and is useful for qualitatively describing where large earthquakes might occur. A large earthquake had been expected in the subduction zone adjacent to northern Chile(3-6), which had not ruptured in a megathrust earthquake since a M similar to 8.8 event in 1877. On 1 April 2014 a M8.2 earthquake occurred within this seismic gap. Here we present an assessment of the seismotectonics of the March-April 2014 Iquique sequence, including analyses of earthquake relocations, moment tensors, finite fault models, moment deficit calculations and cumulative Coulomb stress transfer. This ensemble of information allows us to place the sequence within the context of regional seismicity and to identify areas of remaining and/or elevated hazard. Our results constrain the size and spatial extent of rupture, and indicate that this was not the earthquake that had been anticipated. Significant sections of the northern Chile subduction zone have not ruptured in almost 150 years, so it is likely that future megathrust earthquakes will occur to the south and potentially to the north of the 2014 Iquique sequence.","[Hayes, Gavin P.; Barnhart, William D.; Benz, Harley M.; Earle, Paul S.] US Geol Survey, Natl Earthquake Informat Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Herman, Matthew W.; Furlong, Kevin P.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Riquelme, Sebastian; Barrientos, Sergio] Univ Chile, Ctr Sismol Nacl, Santiago 8370449, Chile; [Bergman, Eric] Global Seismol Serv, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Samsonov, Sergey] Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Mapping & Earth Observat, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E4, Canada","Hayes, GP (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Natl Earthquake Informat Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",ghayes@usgs.gov,"Barnhart, William/L-9446-2015","Herman, Matthew/0000-0003-4684-9459; Samsonov, Sergey/0000-0002-6798-4847",National Science Foundation [EAR-1153317],"We thank R.

The Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile monitored the entire sequence of events, providing unprecedented resolution of the build-up to the main event and its rupture evolution. Here we show that the Iquique earthquake broke a central fraction of the so-called northern Chile seismic gap, the last major segment of the South American plate boundary that had not ruptured in the past century(1,2). Since July 2013 three seismic clusters, each lasting a few weeks, hit this part of the plate boundary with earthquakes of increasing peak magnitudes. Starting with the second cluster, geodetic observations show surface displacements that can be associated with slip on the plate interface. These seismic clusters and their slip transients occupied a part of the plate interface that was transitional between a fully locked and a creeping portion. Leading up to this earthquake, the b value of the foreshocks gradually decreased during the years before the earthquake, reversing its trend a few days before the Iquique earthquake. The mainshock finally nucleated at the northern end of the foreshock area, which skirted a locked patch, and ruptured mainly downdip towards higher locking. Peak slip was attained immediately downdip of the foreshock region and at the margin of the locked patch. We conclude that gradual weakening of the central part of the seismic gap accentuated by the foreshock activity in a zone of intermediate seismic coupling was instrumental in causing final failure, distinguishing the Iquique earthquake from most great earthquakes. Finally, only one-third of the gap was broken and the remaining locked segments nowpose a significant, increased seismic hazard with the potential to host an earthquake with a magnitude of > 8.5.","[Schurr, Bernd; Asch, Guenter; Hainzl, Sebastian; Bedford, Jonathan; Hoechner, Andreas; Palo, Mauro; Wang, Rongjiang; Moreno, Marcos; Bartsch, Mitja; Oncken, Onno; Tilmann, Frederik; Dahm, Torsten; Victor, Pia] German Res Ctr Geosci, GFZ Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Zhang, Yong] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Barrientos, Sergio] Univ Chile, Ctr Sismol Natl, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Santiago 2002, Chile; [Vilotte, Jean-Pierre] Inst Phys Globe Paris, F-75238 Paris 05, France","Schurr, B (reprint author), German Res Ctr Geosci, GFZ Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",schurr@gfz-potsdam.de,"Moreno, Marcos/M-4632-2013; Zhang, Yong/P-8971-2015; Vilotte, Jean-Pierre/H-1552-2017","Moreno, Marcos/0000-0002-6023-7283; Vilotte, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-6085-6498; Hoechner, Andreas/0000-0002-3494-5200",GFZ; Hannover Re,"Data used in this study come from the IPOC initiative (http://www.ipoc-network.org) operated by the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Centro Sismologico National, Universidad de Chile, and Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.

The earliest mammals, representing the first 50 million years of their evolution and including the most basal taxa, are widely considered to be generalized insectivores(1,2). This implies that the first phase of the mammalian radiation-associated with the appearance in the fossil record of important innovations such as heterodont dentition, diphyodonty and the dentary-squamosal jaw joint(1,3)-was decoupled from ecomorphological diversification(2,4). Finds of exceptionally complete specimens of later Mesozoic mammals have revealed greater ecomorphological diversity than previously suspected, including adaptations for swimming, burrowing, digging and even gliding(2,5,6), but such well-preserved fossils of earlier mammals do not exist(1), and robust analysis of their ecomorphological diversity has previously been lacking. Here we present the results of an integrated analysis, using synchrotron X-ray tomography and analyses of biomechanics, finite element models and tooth microwear textures. We find significant differences in function and dietary ecology between two of the earliest mammalia form taxa, Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium-taxa that are central to the debate on mammalian evolution. Morganucodon possessed comparatively more forceful and robust jaws and consumed 'harder' prey, comparable to extant small bodied mammals that eat considerable amounts of coleopterans. Kuehneotherium ingested a diet comparable to extant mixed feeders and specialists on 'soft' prey such as lepidopterans. Our results reveal previously hidden trophic specialization at the base of the mammalian radiation; hence even the earliest mammalia forms were beginning to diversify-morphologically, functionally and ecologically. In contrast to the prevailing view(2,4), this pattern suggests that lineage splitting during the earliest stages of mammalian evolution was associated with ecomorphological specialization and niche partitioning.","[Gill, Pamela G.; Crumpton, Nick; Gostling, Neil J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Purnell, Mark A.] Univ Leicester, Dept Geol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Brown, Kate Robson] Univ Bristol, Dept Archaeol & Anthropol, Bristol BS8 1UU, Avon, England; [Stampanoni, M.] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Stampanoni, M.] Univ Zurich, Inst Biomed Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stampanoni, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rayfield, Emily J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England","Gill, PG (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",pam.gill@bristol.ac.uk; e.rayfield@bristol.ac.uk,"Stampanoni, Marco/J-4099-2013; Purnell, Mark/A-2336-2010; Rayfield, Emily/F-5038-2010","Stampanoni, Marco/0000-0001-7486-6681; Purnell, Mark/0000-0002-1777-9220; Rayfield, Emily/0000-0002-2618-750X","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E010431/1, NE/K01496X/1]; European Commission [RII3-CT-2004-506008];  [NE/G018189/1]","We thank G.

Determining the spatiotemporal relationship between the two populations is crucial if we are to understand the processes, timing and reasons leading to the disappearance of Neanderthals and the likelihood of cultural and genetic exchange. Serious technical challenges, however, have hindered reliable dating of the period, as the radiocarbon method reaches its limit at 50,000 years ago(3). Here we apply improved accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 techniques to construct robust chronologies from 40 key Mousterian and Neanderthal archaeological sites, ranging from Russia to Spain. Bayesian age modelling was used to generate probability distribution functions to determine the latest appearance date. We show that the Mousterian ended by 41,030-39,260 calibrated years BP (at 95.4% probability) across Europe. Wealso demonstrate that succeeding 'transitional' archaeological industries, one of which has been linked with Neanderthals (Chatelperronian)(4), end at a similar time. Our data indicate that the disappearance of Neanderthals occurred at different times in different regions. Comparing the data with results obtained from the earliest dated AMH sites in Europe, associated with the Uluzzian technocomplex(5), allows us to quantify the temporal overlap between the two human groups. The results reveal a significant overlap of 2,600-5,400 years (at 95.4% probability). This has important implications for models seeking to explain the cultural, technological and biological elements involved in the replacement of Neanderthals by AMHs. A mosaic of populations in Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition suggests that there was ample time for the transmission of cultural and symbolic behaviours, as well as possible genetic exchanges, between the two groups.","[Higham, Tom;

Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) lies beneath approximately 800m of ice on the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and evolving subglacial drainage network(5). The water column of SLW contained metabolically active microorganisms and was derived primarily from glacial ice melt with solute sources from lithogenic weathering and a minor seawater component.

Our results confirm that aquatic environments beneath the Antarctic ice sheet support viablemicrobial ecosystems, corroborating previous reports suggesting that they contain globally relevant pools of carbon and microbes(2,4) that can mobilize elements from the lithosphere(6) and influence Southern Ocean geochemical and biological systems(7).","[Christner, Brent C.; Achberger, Amanda M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Priscu, John C.; Michaud, Alexander B.; Vick-Majors, Trista J.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Barbante, Carlo] CNR, Inst Dynam Environm Proc, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Barbante, Carlo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Carter, Sasha P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Christianson, Knut] St Olaf Coll, Dept Phys, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Mikucki, Jill A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Mitchell, Andrew C.] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales; [Skidmore, Mark L.] Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Christner, BC (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",xner@lsu.edu; jpriscu@montana.edu,,"Vick-Majors, Trista/0000-0002-6868-4010; Horgan, Huw/0000-0002-4836-0078","National Science Foundation from the Division of Polar Programs [0838933, 0838896, 0838941, 0839142, 0839059, 0838885, 0838855, 0838763, 0839107, 0838947, 0838854, 0838764, 1142123]; NSF [1023233, 1115245, 1247192]; Italian National Antarctic Program; NSF's IGERT Program [0654336]; Montana Space Grant Consortium","The Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project was funded by National Science Foundation grants (0838933, 0838896, 0838941, 0839142, 0839059, 0838885, 0838855, 0838763, 0839107, 0838947, 0838854, 0838764 and 1142123) from the Division of Polar Programs.

In all vertebrate embryos that have been studied, definitive HSCs are generated initially within the dorsal aorta (DA) of the embryonic vasculature by a series of poorly understood inductive events(1-3). Previous studies have identified that signalling relayed from adjacent somites coordinates HSC induction, but the nature of this signal has remained elusive(4). Here we reveal that somite specification of HSCs occurs via the deployment of a specific endothelial precursor population, which arises within a sub-compartment of the zebrafish somite that we have defined as the endotome. Endothelial cells of the endotomeare specified within the nascent somite by the activity of the homeobox genemeox(1). Specified endotomal cells consequently migrate and colonize the DA, where they induce HSC formation through the deployment of chemokine signalling activated in these cells during endotome formation. Loss of meox(1) activity expands the endotome at the expense of a second somitic cell type, the muscle precursors of the dermomyotomal equivalent in zebrafish, the external cell layer. The resulting increase in endotome-derived cells that migrate to colonize the DA generates a dramatic increase in chemokine-dependent HSC induction. This study reveals the molecular basis for a novel somite lineage restriction mechanism and defines a new paradigm in induction of definitive HSCs.","[Phong Dang Nguyen; Sonntag, Carmen; Miles, Lee Barry; Hall, Thomas Edward; Berger, Silke; Gurevich, David Baruch; Alaei, Sara; Ramialison, Mirana; Polo, Jose Maria; Lieschke, Graham John; Currie, Peter David] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Hollway, Georgina Elizabeth; Fernandez, Kristine Joy; Sutherland, Robert Lyndsay] Garvan Inst Med Res, Kinghorn Canc Ctr, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia; [Hollway, Georgina Elizabeth; Fernandez, Kristine Joy; Sutherland, Robert Lyndsay] Garvan Inst Med Res, Canc Res Program, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia; [Hollway, Georgina Elizabeth; Sutherland, Robert Lyndsay] Univ New S Wales, Fac Med, St Vincents Clin Sch, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cole, Nicholas James] Univ Sydney, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Cole, Nicholas James] Macquarie Univ, Australian Sch Adv Med, MND Res Program, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Alaei, Sara] Monash Univ, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Currie, Peter David] Monash Univ, EMBL Australia, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Currie, PD (reprint author), Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Level 1,Bldg 75,Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",peter.currie@monash.edu,"cole, nicholas/M-7010-2016","Ramialison, Mirana/0000-0001-6315-4777; Hall, Thomas/0000-0002-7718-7614; Alaei, Sara/0000-0003-4897-6339; Nguyen, Phong/0000-0003-1889-3276; Currie, Peter /0000-0001-8874-8862",National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC); Australian Research Council; Cancer Institute NSW (CINSW); Australian Postgraduate Award; NHMRC; CINSW; RT Hall Foundation; State Government of Victoria; Australian Federal Government,"We thank G.

We previously reported that the somitic Notch ligands, Dlc and Dld, are essential for HSC specification(4). It has remained unclear, however, how these somitic requirements are connected to the later emergence of HSCs from the dorsal aorta. Here we show in zebrafish that Notch signalling establishes HSC fate as their shared vascular precursors migrate across the ventral face of the somite and that junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) mediate this required Notch signal transduction. HSC precursors express jam1a (also known as f11r) and migrate axially across the ventral somite, where Jam2a and the Notch ligands Dlc and Dld are expressed. Despite no alteration in the expression of Notch ligand or receptor genes, loss of function of jam1a led to loss of Notch signalling and loss of HSCs. Enforced activation of Notch in shared vascular precursors rescued HSCs in jam1a or jam2a deficient embryos. Together, these results indicate that Jam1a-Jam2a interactions facilitate the transduction of requisite Notch signals from the somite to the precursors of HSCs, and that these events occur well before formation of the dorsal aorta.","[Kobayashi, Isao; Kobayashi-Sun, Jingjing; Kim, Albert D.; Pouget, Claire; Traver, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fujita, Naonobu; Traver, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Suda, Toshio] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Sakaguchi Lab, Dept Cell Differentiat,Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan","Traver, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dtraver@ucsd.edu,"Suda, Toshio/H-6761-2013; Pouget, Claire/M-9761-2016","Suda, Toshio/0000-0001-7540-1771; Pouget, Claire/0000-0003-4598-6291",JSPS; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine; National Institutes of Health [R01-DK074482]; American Heart Association,"The authors thank G.

They almost uniformly occur in the critical arginine residue (Arg 132) in the catalytic pocket, resulting in a neomorphic enzymatic function, production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)(7,8), genomic hypermethylation9-11, genetic instability and malignant transformation(12). More than 70% of diffuse grade II and grade III gliomas carry the most frequent mutation, IDH1(R132H) (ref. 3). From an immunological perspective, IDH1(R132H) represents a potential target for immunotherapy as it is a tumour-specific potential neoantigen with high uniformity and penetrance expressed in all tumour cells(13,14). Here we demonstrate that IDH1(R132H) contains an immunogenic epitope suitable formutation-specific vaccination. Peptides encompassing the mutated region are presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) class II and induce mutation-specific CD4(+) T-helper-1 (TH1) responses. CD41 TH1 cells and antibodies spontaneously occurring in patients with IDH1(R132H)-mutated gliomas specifically recognize IDH1(R132H). Peptide vaccination of mice devoid of mouse MHC and transgenic for human MHC class I and II with IDH1(R132H) p123-142 results in an effective MHC class II-restrictedmutation-specific antitumourimmune response and control of pre-established syngeneic IDH1(R132H)-expressing tumours in a CD4(+)T-cell-dependent manner. As IDH1(R132H) is present in all tumour cells of these slow-growing gliomas(15), a mutation-specific anti-IDH1(R132H) vaccine may represent a viable novel therapeutic strategy for IDH1(R132H)-mutated tumours.","[Schumacher, Theresa; Bunse, Lukas; Wiestler, Benedikt; Menn, Oliver; Osswald, Matthias; Oezen, Iris; Ott, Martina; Keil, Melanie; Rauschenbach, Katharina; Wick, Wolfgang; Platten, Michael] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Neurooncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schumacher, Theresa; Bunse, Lukas; Wiestler, Benedikt; Menn, Oliver; Osswald, Matthias; Oezen, Iris; Ott, Martina; Keil, Melanie; Rauschenbach, Katharina; Wick, Wolfgang; Platten, Michael] Natl Ctr Tumor Dis, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schumacher, Theresa; Bunse, Lukas; Oezen, Iris; Ott, Martina; Keil, Melanie; Balss, Joerg; Rauschenbach, Katharina; Platten, Michael] German Canc Res Ctr, German Canc Consortium DKTK Clin Cooperat Unit Ne, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Pusch, Stefan; Sahm, Felix; von Deimling, Andreas] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Neuropathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Pusch, Stefan; Sahm, Felix; von Deimling, Andreas] Natl Ctr Tumor Dis, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Pusch, Stefan; Sahm, Felix; Balss, Joerg; von Deimling, Andreas] German Canc Res Ctr, German Canc Consortium DKTK Clin Cooperat Unit Ne, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wiestler, Benedikt; Osswald, Matthias; Wick, Wolfgang] German Canc Res Ctr, German Canc Consortium DKTK Clin Cooperat Unit Ne, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Quandt, Jasmin; Eichmueller, Stefan B.; Beckhove, Philipp] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Translat Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Grabowska, Agnieszka K.; Riemer, Angelika B.] German Canc Res Ctr, Dept Immunotherapy & Prevent Grp, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Vogler, Isabel] Ribological GmbH, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Diekmann, Jan; Sahin, Ugur] Translat Oncol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Trautwein, Nico; Stevanovic, Stefan] Univ Tubingen, Dept Immunol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Okun, Juergen] Univ Childrens Hosp, Metab Ctr Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Friese, Manuel A.] Univ Med Ctr, Ctr Mol Neurobiol, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany","Platten, M (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Neurooncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",m.platten@dkfz.de,"; Eichmuller, Stefan/A-5053-2008; von Deimling, Andreas/F-7774-2013; Bunse, Lukas/L-2975-2016; Sahin, Ugur/L-4818-2017","Friese, Manuel A./0000-0001-6380-2420; Riemer, Angelika/0000-0002-5865-0714; Pusch, Stefan/0000-0002-3407-4249; Platten, Michael/0000-0002-4746-887X; Eichmuller, Stefan/0000-0002-3497-6904; von Deimling, Andreas/0000-0002-5863-540X; Bunse, Lukas/0000-0002-4490-7574; Sahin, Ugur/0000-0003-0363-1564","DKFZ Light Microscopy and Genomics and Proteomics Facilities; NIH; Interdisciplinary Research Program of the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg [IFP III/2]; Wilhelm Sander Foundation [2012.118.1]; Helmholtz Foundation [VH-NG-306]; Andreas Zimprich Foundation; German Research Foundation [SFB938]; Helmholtz International Graduate School; Heinrich F.

In the presence of mRNA secondary structures, a heptanucleotide 'slippery sequence' usually defined by the motif X XXY YYZ, and (in some prokaryotic cases) mRNA sequences that base pair with the 39 end of the 16S ribosomal rRNA (internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences), there is an increased probability that a specific programmed change of frame occurs, wherein the ribosome shifts one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame(-1 frame) and continues by translating a new sequence of amino acids(2,3). Despite extensive biochemical and genetic studies, there is no clear mechanistic description for frameshifting. Here we apply single-molecule fluorescence to track the compositional and conformational dynamics of individual ribosomes at each codon during translation of a frameshift-inducing mRNA from the dnaX gene in Escherichia coli. Ribosomes that frameshift into the -1 frame are characterized by a tenfold longer pause in elongation compared to non-frameshifted ribosomes, which translate through unperturbed. During the pause, interactions of the ribosome with the mRNA stimulatory elements uncouple EF-Gcatalysed translocation from normal ribosomal subunit reverse-rotation, leaving the ribosome in a non-canonical intersubunit rotated state with an exposed codon in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). tRNA(Lys) sampling and accommodation to the empty A site and EF-G action either leads to the slippage of the tRNAs into the-1 frame or maintains the ribosome into the 0 frame. Our results provide a general mechanistic and conformational framework for -1 frameshifting, highlighting multiple kinetic branchpoints during elongation.","[Chen, Jin; Tsai, Albert] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chen, Jin; Petrov, Alexey; Johansson, Magnus; Tsai, Albert; O'Leary, Sean E.; Puglisi, Joseph D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Puglisi, JD (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",puglisi@stanford.edu,,"Johansson, Magnus/0000-0001-8811-2629; Tsai, Albert/0000-0002-1643-0780",US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM51266]; NIH [GM099687]; Wenner-Gren Foundations (Stockholm); Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship,"This work was supported by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant GM51266 to J.C., A.

Members of this ion channel superfamily mediate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission depending on their ligand and ion selectivity. Structural information for Cys-loop receptors comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(5), high-resolution X-ray structures of extracellular domains(6) and X-ray structures of bacterial orthologues(7-10). In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis for anion selectivity and channel block, and the mechanism by which ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate neurotransmitter binding(11). However, there remain unanswered questions about the mechanism of channel opening and closing, the location and nature of the shut ion channel gate, the transitions between the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states, and the mechanism by which conformational changes are coupled between the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane, ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids.","[Althoff, Thorsten; Hibbs, Ryan E.; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Banerjee, Surajit] Cornell Univ, NE CAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,"Banerjee, Surajit/0000-0002-9414-7163; Althoff, Thorsten/0000-0001-5688-5328",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [AL 1725-1/1]; NIH National Research Service Award [F32NS061404]; NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank all staff of beamline 24-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source.

Here we developed a whole-genome and exome single cell sequencing approach called nuc-seq that uses G2/M nuclei to achieve 91% mean coverage breadth. We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumour nuclei from an oestrogen-receptor-positive(ER+) breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements occurred early in tumour evolution and remained highly stable as the tumour masses clonally expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity. Using targeted single-molecule sequencing, many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies (<10%) in the tumour mass. Using mathematical modelling we found that the triple-negative tumour cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3x), whereas the ER+ tumour cells did not. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis, therapeutic treatment and evolution of chemoresistance in breast cancer.","[Wang, Yong; Waters, Jill; Leung, Marco L.; Unruh, Anna; Roh, Whijae; Shi, Xiuqing; Multani, Asha; Navin, Nicholas E.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Leung, Marco L.; Scheet, Paul; Vattathil, Selina; Navin, Nicholas E.] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Ken; Liang, Han; Navin, Nicholas E.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Scheet, Paul] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhang, Hong] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhao, Rui; Michor, Franziska] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhao, Rui; Michor, Franziska] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Meric-Bernstam, Funda] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Invest Canc Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Navin, NE (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",nnavin@mdanderson.org,,"Casasent, Anna/0000-0002-7857-179X; Roh, Whijae/0000-0002-7395-9939; Wang, Yong/0000-0001-7183-3737","NIH [R21CA174397-01, TR000371, U24CA143883]; NCI [1RO1CA169244-01, RO1CA172652, CA016672]; T.C.

Cullin-RINGE3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are regulated by the eight-subunit COP9 signalosome (CSN). CSN inactivates CRLs by removing their covalently attached activator, NEDD8. NEDD8 cleavage by CSN is catalysed by CSN5, a Zn2+-dependent isopeptidase that is inactive in isolation. Here we present the crystal structure of the entire similar to 350-kDa human CSN holoenzyme at 3.8 angstrom resolution, detailing the molecular architecture of the complex. CSN has two organizational centres: a horseshoe-shaped ring created by its six proteasome lid-CSN-initiation factor 3 (PCI) domain proteins, and a large bundle formed by the carboxy-terminal a-helices of every subunit. CSN5 and its dimerization partner, CSN6, are intricately embedded at the core of the helical bundle. In the substrate-free holoenzyme, CSN5 is autoinhibited, which precludes access to the active site. We find that neddylated CRL binding to CSN is sensed by CSN4, and communicated to CSN5 with the assistance of CSN6, resulting in activation of the deneddylase.","[Lingaraju, Gondichatnahalli M.; Bunker, Richard D.; Cavadini, Simone; Hess, Daniel; Fischer, Eric S.; Thomae, Nicolas H.] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Lingaraju, Gondichatnahalli M.; Bunker, Richard D.; Cavadini, Simone; Fischer, Eric S.; Thomae, Nicolas H.] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Hassiepen, Ulrich; Renatus, Martin] Novartis Pharma AG, Inst Biomed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Thoma, NH (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",nicolas.thoma@fmi.ch,,"Bunker, Richard/0000-0001-8866-5290; Fischer, Eric S./0000-0001-7337-6306",Novartis Research Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_144020]; European Research Council (MoBa-CS) [260481]; Novartis (NIBR),"This work was supported by the Novartis Research Foundation, the Swiss National Science Foundation (31003A_144020) and the European Research Council (MoBa-CS #260481).

Here we report the three-dimensional structure of an intact human gamma-secretase complex at 4.5 angstrom resolution, determined by cryo-electron-microscopy single-particle analysis. The gamma-secretase complex comprises a horseshoe-shaped transmembrane domain, which contains 19 transmembrane segments (TMs), and a large extracellular domain (ECD) from nicastrin, which sits immediately above the hollow space formed by the TM horseshoe. Intriguingly, nicastrin ECD is structurally similar to a large family of peptidases exemplified by the glutamate carboxypeptidase PSMA. This structure serves as an important basis for understanding the functional mechanisms of the gamma-secretase complex.","[Lu, Peilong; Ma, Dan; Xie, Tian; Sun, Linfeng; Zhao, Yanyu; Zhou, Rui; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Minist Educ,Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Peilong; Ma, Dan; Xie, Tian; Yan, Chuangye; Sun, Linfeng; Yang, Guanghui; Zhao, Yanyu; Zhou, Rui; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Peilong; Ma, Dan; Xie, Tian; Yan, Chuangye; Sun, Linfeng; Yang, Guanghui; Zhao, Yanyu; Zhou, Rui; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Bai, Xiao-chen; Scheres, Sjors H.

Observations of an unexpectedly intense diffuse flux of easily absorbed 1/4-kiloelectronvolt X-rays(1,2), coupled with the discovery that interstellar space within about a hundred parsecs of the Sun is almost completely devoid of cool absorbing gas(3), led to a picture of a 'local cavity' filled with X-ray-emitting hot gas, dubbed the local hot bubble(4-6). This model was recently challenged by suggestions that the emission could instead be readily produced within the Solar System by heavy solar-wind ions exchanging electrons with neutral H and He in interplanetary space(7-11), potentially removing the major piece of evidence for the local existence of million-degree gas within the Galactic disk(12-15). Here we report observations showing that the total solar-wind charge-exchange contribution is approximately 40 per cent of the 1/4-keV flux in the Galactic plane. The fact that the measured flux is not dominated by charge exchange supports the notion of a million-degree hot bubble extending about a hundred parsecs from the Sun.","[Galeazzi, M.; Uprety, Y.; Ursino, E.] Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Chiao, M.; Collier, M.

The physical behaviour of such 'rubble-pile' asteroids has been traditionally described using only gravitational and frictional forces within a granular material(3). Cohesive forces in the form of small van der Waals forces between constituent grains have recently been predicted to be important for small rubble piles (ten kilometres across or less), and could potentially explain fast rotation rates in the small-asteroid population(4-6). The strongest evidence so far has come from an analysis of the rotational breakup of the main-belt comet P/2013 R3 (ref. 7), although that was indirect and poorly constrained by observations. Here we report that the kilometre-sized asteroid (29075) 1950 DA(ref. 8) is a rubble pile that is rotating faster than is allowed by gravity and friction. We find that cohesive forces are required to prevent surface mass shedding and structural failure, and that the strengths of the forces are comparable to, though somewhat less than, the forces found between the grains of lunar regolith.","[Rozitis, Ben; MacLennan, Eric; Emery, Joshua P.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Rozitis, B (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",brozitis@utk.edu,,,"Planetary Science Division of NASA; NASA [NNM10AA11C, NNX12AP32G]","This publication uses data products from NEOWISE, a project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, funded by the Planetary Science Division of NASA.

Experimentally, however, vitrification of single-element metallic liquids is notoriously difficult(5). True laboratory demonstration of the formation of monatomic metallic glass has been lacking. Here we report an experimental approach to the vitrification of monatomic metallic liquids by achieving an unprecedentedly high liquid-quenching rate of 10(14)Ks(-1). Under such a high cooling rate, melts of pure refractory body-centred cubic (bcc) metals, such as liquid tantalum and vanadium, are successfully vitrified to form metallic glasses suitable for property interrogations. Combining in situ transmission electron microscopy observation and atoms-to-continuum modelling, we investigated the formation condition and thermal stability of the monatomic metallic glasses as obtained. The availability of monatomic metallic glasses, being the simplest glass formers, offers unique possibilities for studying the structure and property relationships of glasses. Our technique also shows great control over the reversible vitrification-crystallization processes, suggesting its potential in micro-electromechanical applications. The ultrahigh cooling rate, approaching the highest liquid-quenching rate attainable in the experiment, makes it possible to explore the fast kinetics and structural behaviour of supercooled metallic liquids within the nanosecond to picosecond regimes.","[Zhong, Li; Wang, Jiangwei; Mao, Scott X.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Sheng, Hongwei] George Mason Univ, Sch Phys Astron & Computat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Sheng, Hongwei] Ctr High Pressure Sci & Technol Adv Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ze] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ze] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Mao, SX (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",hsheng@gmu.edu; sxm2@pitt.edu,"Wang, Jiangwei/F-8249-2011; Zhong, Li/I-3714-2014","Wang, Jiangwei/0000-0003-1191-0782; ",National Science Foundation (NSF) through University of Pittsburgh [CMMI 0928517]; US NSF [DMR-0907325],"We thank A.

Previous hypotheses for its origin have included late accretion events(4), large impacts(5), tidal effects(6) and convection processes(7). However, testing these hypotheses and quantifying the Moon's topography is complicated by the large basins that have formed since the crust crystallized. Here we estimate the large-scale lunar topography and gravity spherical harmonics outside these basins and show that the bulk of the spherical harmonic degree-2 topography is consistent with a crust-building process controlled by early tidal heating throughout the Moon. The remainder of the degree-2 topography is consistent with a frozen tidal-rotational bulge that formed later, at a semi-major axis of about 32 Earth radii. The probability of the degree-2 shape having both tidal-heating and frozen shape characteristics by chance is less than 1%. We also infer that internal density contrasts eventually reoriented the Moon's polar axis by 36 +/- 4 degrees, to the configuration we observe today.

Animal models(1) can demonstrate the effects of neurotoxic substances; however, they provide limited insight into the psycho-social and higher cognitive factors involved in the initiation of substance use and progression to misuse. One can search for pre-existing risk factors by testing for endophenotypic biomarkers(2) in non-using relatives; however, these relatives may have personality or neural resilience factors that protect them from developing dependence(3). A longitudinal study has potential to identify predictors of adolescent substance misuse, particularly if it can incorporate a wide range of potential causal factors, both proximal and distal, and their influence on numerous social, psychological and biological mechanisms(4). Here we apply machine learning to a wide range of data from a large sample of adolescents (n = 692) to generate models of current and future adolescent alcohol misuse that incorporate brain structure and function, individual personality and cognitive differences, environmental factors (including gestational cigarette and alcohol exposure), life experiences, and candidate genes. These models were accurate and generalized to novel data, and point to life experiences, neurobiological differences and personality as important antecedents of binge drinking. By identifying the vulnerability factors underlying individual differences in alcohol misuse, these models shed light on the aetiology of alcohol misuse and suggest targets for prevention.","[Whelan, Robert; Ortiz, Nick; Garavan, Hugh] Univ Vermont, Dept Psychiat, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Whelan, Robert] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Psychol, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Watts, Richard] Univ Vermont, Dept Radiol, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Orr, Catherine A.] Univ Vermont, Vermont Ctr Children Youth & Families, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Althoff, Robert R.] Univ Vermont, Dept Pediat, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Althoff, Robert R.; Garavan, Hugh] Univ Vermont, Dept Psychol, Burlington, VT 05401 USA; [Artiges, Eric; Martinot, Jean-Luc] Univ Paris 11, CEA, INSERM, Imaging & Psychiat U1000, F-91400 Orsay, France; [Artiges, Eric] Orsay Hosp, Dept Psychiat, F-91400 Orsay, France; [Banaschewski, Tobias; Flor, Herta; Fauth-Buehler, Mira; Mann, Karl; Nees, Frauke; Rietschel, Marcella] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Barker, Gareth J.; Carvalho, Fabiana M.; Conrod, Patricia J.; Schumann, Gunter] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, London SE5 8AF, England; [Bokde, Arun L.

Motivated by this, we performed association mapping of T2D-related quantitative traits in up to 2,575 Greenlandic individuals without known diabetes. Using array-based genotyping and exome sequencing, we discovered a nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant (in which arginine is replaced by a termination codon) in the gene TBC1D4 with an allele frequency of 17%. Here we show that homozygous carriers of this variant have markedly higher concentrations of plasma glucose(beta=3.8 mmol l(-1), P = 2.5 X 10(-35)) and serum insulin (beta = 165 pmol l(-1), P = 1.5 X 10(-20)) 2 hours after an oral glucose load compared with individuals with other genotypes (both non-carriers and heterozygous carriers). Furthermore, homozygous carriers have marginally lower concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (beta = -0.18 mmol l(-1), P = 1.1 X 10(-6)) and fasting serum insulin (beta = -8.3 pmol l(-1), P = 0.0014), and their T2D risk is markedly increased (odds ratio (OR) = 10.3, P = 1.6 X 10(-24)). Heterozygous carriers have a moderately higher plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose load than non-carriers (beta = 0.43 mmol l(-1), P = 5.3 X 10(-5)). Analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies showed lower messenger RNA and protein levels of the long isoform of TBC1D4, and lower muscle protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4, with increasing number of p.Arg684Ter alleles. These findings are concomitant with a severely decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and T2D. The observed effect sizes are several times larger than any previous findings in large-scale genome-wide association studies of these traits(2-4) and constitute further proof of the value of conducting genetic association studies outside the traditional setting of large homogeneous populations.","[Moltke, Ida; Albrechtsen, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Moltke, Ida] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Grarup, Niels; Krarup, Nikolaj T.; Gjesing, Anette P.; Wang, Jun; Pedersen, Oluf; Hansen, Torben] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Sect Metab Genet, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jorgensen, Marit E.] Steno Diabet Ctr, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark; [Bjerregaard, Peter] Univ Southern Denmark, Natl Inst Publ Hlth, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Treebak, Jonas T.; Andersen, Marianne A.; Nielsen, Thomas S.; Zierath, Juleen R.] Univ Copenhagen, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Sect Integrat Physiol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fumagalli, Matteo; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Korneliussen, Thorfinn S.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zierath, Juleen R.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Mol Med & Surg, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Linneberg, Allan] Glostrup Univ Hosp, Res Ctr Prevent & Hlth, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark; [Wu, Xueli; Sun, Guangqing; Jin, Xin; Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Genet, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Princess Al Jawhara Albrahim Ctr Excellence Res H, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macao 999078, Peoples R China; [Borch-Johnsen, Knut] Holbaek Cent Hosp, DK-4300 Holbaek, Denmark; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hansen, Torben] Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Hlth Sci, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark","Hansen, T (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Sect Metab Genet, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",albrecht@binf.ku.dk; torben.hansen@sund.ku.dk,"; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016; Albrechtsen, Anders/K-4281-2013; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand/F-6421-2014; Grarup, Niels/K-2807-2015; Moltke, Ida/C-6158-2011; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Treebak, Jonas/B-4521-2017","Nielsen, Thomas Svava/0000-0002-9457-8000; Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591; Gjesing, Anette P/0000-0003-4580-1576; Zierath, Juleen/0000-0001-6891-7497; Linneberg, Allan/0000-0002-0994-0184; Jorgensen, Marit Eika/0000-0001-8356-5565; Fumagalli, Matteo/0000-0002-4084-2953; Agerholm Andersen, Marianne/0000-0001-8687-1031; Bjerregaard, Peter/0000-0001-7153-8447; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Albrechtsen, Anders/0000-0001-7306-031X; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand/0000-0001-7576-5380; Grarup, Niels/0000-0001-5526-1070; Moltke, Ida/0000-0001-7052-8554; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Treebak, Jonas/0000-0003-1488-7012",Novo Nordisk Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research (Medical Sciences); Steno Diabetes Center; Villum Foundation; Karen Elise Jensen's Foundation; NunaFonden; Medical Research Council of Denmark; Medical Research Council of Greenland; Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland,"We thank I.

These diverse environments are likely to have acted as agents of natural selection and to have led to local adaptations. One of the most celebrated examples in humans is the adaptation of Tibetans to the hypoxic environment of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau(1-3). A hypoxia pathway gene, EPAS1, was previously identified as having the most extreme signature of positive selection in Tibetans(4-10), and was shown to be associated with differences in haemoglobin concentration at high altitude. Re-sequencing the region around EPAS1 in 40 Tibetan and 40 Han individuals, we find that this gene has a highly unusual haplotype structure that can only be convincingly explained by introgression of DNA from Denisovan or Denisovan-related individuals into humans. Scanning a larger set of worldwide populations, we find that the selected haplotype is only found in Denisovans and in Tibetans, and at very low frequency among Han Chinese. Furthermore, the length of the haplotype, and the fact that it is not found in any other populations, makes it unlikely that the haplotype sharing between Tibetans and Denisovans was caused by incomplete ancestral lineage sorting rather than introgression. Our findings illustrate that admixture with other hominin species has provided genetic variation that helped humans to adapt to new environments.","[Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Jin, Xin; Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin; He, Mingze; Somel, Mehmet; Ni, Peixiang; Wang, Bo; Ou, Xiaohua; Huasang; Luosang, Jiangbai; Yin, Ye; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Xiuqing; Xu, Xun; Yang, Huanming; Li, Yingrui; Wang, Jian; Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Peter, Benjamin M.; Vinckenbosch, Nicolas; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia] Univ Calif, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Jin, Xin] S China Univ Technol, Sch Biosci & Bioengn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin] BGI Tianjin, Binhai Genom Inst, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin] BGI Tianjin, Tianjin Translat Genom Ctr, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Bianba, Zhuoma] Peoples Hosp Lhasa, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [He, Mingze] Iowa State Univ, Bioinformat & Computat Biol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Somel, Mehmet] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Cuo, Zha Xi Ping] Second Peoples Hosp Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Li, Kui] Peoples Hosp Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Guoyi] Hosp XiShuangBanNa Dai Nationalities, Autonomous Jinghong 666100, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuqing] BGI Shenzhen, Guangdong Enterprise Key Lab Human Dis Genom, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuqing] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen Key Lab Trans Biotechnol, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Princess Al Jawhara Ctr Excellence Res Hereditary, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian] James D Watson Inst Genome Sci, Hangzhou 310008, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Med, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Wang, J (reprint author), BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China.",wangjian@genomics.cn; wangj@genomics.cn; rasmus_nielsen@berkeley.edu,"Li, Yingrui/K-1064-2015; Somel, Mehmet/B-1471-2016; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016","Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Somel, Mehmet/0000-0002-3138-1307; Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591","973 Program [2011CB809203, 2012CB518201, 2011CB809201, 2011CB809202]; State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China; China National GeneBank-Shenzhen; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies [CXB201108250096A]; US NIH [R01HG003229, R01HG003229-08S2]","This research was funded by the State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China, 973 Program (2011CB809203, 2012CB518201, 2011CB809201, 2011CB809202), China National GeneBank-Shenzhen and Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies (no.

While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed(2-5), the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated gamma H2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar gamma H2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.","[Flach, Johanna; Bakker, Sietske T.; Mohrin, Mary; Pietras, Eric M.; Reynaud, Damien; Passegue, Emmanuelle] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Hem Onc Div, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Flach, Johanna] Ctr Comprehens Canc, Inst Expt Canc Res, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Conroy, Pauline C.; Morrison, Ciaran G.] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Nat Sci, Ctr Chromosome Biol, Galway, Ireland; [Alvarez, Silvia; Mendez, Juan] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Diolaiti, Morgan E.; Stohr, Bradley A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ugarte, Fernando; Forsberg, E.

Direct insights into the extent and causes of evolutionary contingency have been limited to experimental systems(7-9), because it is difficult to know what happened in the deep past and to characterize other paths that evolution could have followed. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction, directed evolution and biophysical analysis to explore alternative 'might-have-been' trajectories during the ancient evolution of a novel protein function. We previously found that the evolution of cortisol specificity in the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was contingent on permissive substitutions, which had no apparent effect on receptor function but were necessary for GR to tolerate the large-effect mutations that caused the shift in specificity(6). Here we show that alternative mutations that could have permitted the historical function-switching substitutions are extremely rare in the ensemble of genotypes accessible to the ancestral GR. In a library of thousands of variants of the ancestral protein, we recovered historical permissive substitutions but no alternative permissive genotypes. Using biophysical analysis, we found that permissive mutations must satisfy at least three physical requirements-they must stabilize specific local elements of the protein structure, maintain the correct energetic balance between functional conformations, and be compatible with the ancestral and derived structures-thus revealing why permissive mutations are rare. These findings demonstrate that GR evolution depended strongly on improbable, non-deterministic events, and this contingency arose from intrinsic biophysical properties of the protein.","[Harms, Michael J.] Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Harms, Michael J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Chem & Biochem, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Harms, Michael J.; Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Harms, Michael J.; Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Thornton, Joseph W.] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Thornton, JW (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",joet1@uchicago.edu,,"Harms, Michael/0000-0002-0241-4122","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32-GM090650, NIH R01-GM081592, R01-GM104397]; NSF [IOB-0546906]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Early Career Scientist award","We thank J.

For many mRNAs this AUG belongs to a short upstream open reading frame (uORF)(3), and translation of the main downstream ORF requires re-initiation, an incompletely understood process(1,4-6). Re-initiation is thought to involve the same factors as standard initiation(1,5,7). It is unknown whether any factors specifically affect translation re-initiation without affecting standard cap-dependent translation. Here we uncover the non-canonical initiation factors density regulated protein (DENR) and multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1(MCT-1; also called MCTS1 inhumans) as the first selective regulators of eukaryotic re-initiation. mRNAs containing upstream ORFs with strong Kozak sequences selectively require DENR-MCT-1 for their proper translation, yielding a novel class of mRNAs that can be co-regulated and that is enriched for regulatory proteins such as oncogenic kinases.

These ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers promote heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing(1) by generating regularly spaced nucleosome arrays(2-5). The nucleosome-spacing activity arises from the dependence of nucleosome translocation on the length of extranucleosomal linker DNA(6-10), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we study nucleosome remodelling by human ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodelling factor (ACF), an ISWI enzyme comprising a catalytic subunit, Snf2h, and an accessory subunit, Acf1 (refs 2, 11-13). We find that ACF senses linker DNA length through an interplay between its accessory and catalytic subunits mediated by the histone H4 tail of the nucleosome. Mutation of AutoN, an auto-inhibitory domain within Snf2h that bears sequence homology to the H4 tail(14), abolishes the linker-length sensitivity in remodelling. Addition of exogenous H4-tail peptide or deletion of the nucleosomal H4 tail also diminishes the linker-length sensitivity. Moreover, Acf1 binds both the H4-tail peptide and DNA in an amino (N)-terminal domain dependent manner, and in the ACF-bound nucleosome, lengthening the linker DNA reduces the Acf1-H4 tail proximity. Deletion of the N-terminal portion of Acf1 (or itshomologue in yeast) abolishes linker-length sensitivity in remodelling and leads to severe growth defects in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest a mechanism for nucleosome spacing where linker DNA sensing by Acf1 is allosterically transmitted to Snf2h through the H4 tail of the nucleosome. For nucleosomes with short linker DNA, Acf1 preferentially binds to the H4 tail, allowing AutoN to inhibit the ATPase activity of Snf2h. As the linker DNA lengthens, Acf1 shifts its binding preference to the linker DNA, freeing the H4 tail to compete Auto N off the ATPase and thereby activating ACF.","[Hwang, William L.; Deindl, Sebastian; Harada, Bryan T.; Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hwang, William L.; Harada, Bryan T.] Harvard Univ, Grad Program Biophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hwang, William L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Harvard MIT MD PhD Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Deindl, Sebastian; Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhuang, Xiaowei] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Zhuang, XW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",zhuang@chemistry.harvard.edu,,"Harada, Bryan/0000-0002-9683-782X; Deindl, Sebastian/0000-0001-6807-8654","National Institutes of Health [GM105637, T32G007753]","We thank G.

A recent surge of structural data on a number of GPCRs, including the beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR)-G-proteincomplex, has provided novel insights into the structural basis of receptor activation(6-11). However, complementary information has been lacking on the recruitment of beta-arrestins to activated GPCRs, primarily owing to challenges in obtaining stable receptor-beta-arrestin complexes for structural studies. Here we devised a strategy for forming and purifying a functional human beta(2)AR-beta-arrestin-1 complex that allowed us to visualize its architecture by single-particle negative-stain electron microscopy and to characterize the interactions between beta(2)AR and beta-arrestin 1 using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and chemical crosslinking. Electron microscopy two-dimensional averages and three dimensional reconstructions reveal bimodal binding of beta-arrestin 1 to the beta(2)AR, involving two separate sets of interactions, one with the phosphorylated carboxy terminus of the receptor and the other with its seven-transmembrane core. Areas of reduced HDX together with identification of crosslinked residues suggest engagement of the finger loop of beta-arrestin 1 with the seven-transmembrane core of the receptor. In contrast, focal areas of raised HDX levels indicate regions of increased dynamics in both the N and C domains of beta-arrestin 1 when coupled to the beta(2)AR. A molecular model of the beta(2)AR-beta-arrestin signalling complex was made by docking activated beta-arrestin 1 and beta(2)AR crystal structures into the electron microscopymap densities with constraints provided by HDX-MS and crosslinking, allowing us to obtain valuable insights into the overall architecture of a receptor-arrestin complex. The dynamic and structural information presented here provides a framework for better understanding the basis of GPCR regulation by arrestins.","[Shukla, Arun K.; Xiao, Kunhong; Reis, Rosana I.; Huang, Li-Yin; Tripathi-Shukla, Prachi; Qian, Jiang; Blanc, Adi; Yao, Xiao Jie; Klink, Bjoern U.; Kahsai, Alem W.; Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Westfield, Gerwin H.; Oleskie, Austin N.; Dosey, Anne M.; Su, Min; Skiniotis, Georgios] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Life Sci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Westfield, Gerwin H.; Oleskie, Austin N.; Dosey, Anne M.; Su, Min; Skiniotis, Georgios] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Li, Sheng; Woods, Virgil L., Jr.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liang, Cui-Rong; Gu, Ling-Ling; Shan, Jin-Ming; Chen, Xin] Changzhou Univ, Sch Pharmaceut & Life Sci, Changzhou 213164, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hanna, Rachel; Sidhu, Sachdev S.] Univ Toronto, Terrence Donnelly Ctr Cellular & Biomol Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Choi, Minjung; Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Koide, Shohei; Kossiakoff, Anthony A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Penczek, Pawel A.] Univ Texas Houston, Med Sch Houston, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77054 USA; [Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Lefkowitz, RJ (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",kobilka@stanford.edu; skinioti@umich.edu; lefko001@receptor-biol.duke.edu,,"shukla, arun/0000-0003-2910-8288; Koide, Shohei/0000-0001-5473-4358","National Institutes of Health [DK090165, NS028471, GM072688, GM087519, HL075443, HL16037, HL70631]; Mathers Foundation [GM60635]; Pew Scholars Program in Biomedical Sciences; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-93725]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior","We thank D.

However, variation in NPP may also result from an indirect influence of climate by means of plant age, stand biomass, growing season length and local adaptation. To identify the relative importance of direct and indirect climate effects, we extend metabolic scaling theory to link hypothesized climate influences with NPP, and assess hypothesized relationships using a global compilation of ecosystem woody plant biomass and production data. Notably, age and biomass explained most of the variation in production whereas temperature and precipitation explained almost none, suggesting that climate indirectly (not directly) influences production. Furthermore, our theory shows that variation in NPP is characterized by a common scaling relationship, suggesting that global change models can incorporate the mechanisms governing this relationship to improve predictions of future ecosystem function.","[Michaletz, Sean T.; Enquist, Brian J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Cheng, Dongliang] Fujian Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Humid Subtrop Ecogeog Proc, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Kerkhoff, Andrew J.] Kenyon Coll, Dept Biol, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] The iPlant Collaborat, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] Aspen Ctr Environm Studies, Aspen, CO 81611 USA","Enquist, BJ (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",chengdl@fjnu.edu.cn; benquist@email.arizona.edu,,"Michaletz, Sean/0000-0003-2158-6525; Enquist, Brian/0000-0002-6124-7096","NSF [1065861]; Aspen Center for Environmental Studies; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31170374, 31370589]; Fujian Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar [2013J06009]; National Science Foundation [1065861]","S.T.M. and B.J.E. were supported by an NSF MacroSystems award (1065861) and a fellowship from the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies.

Character inter-dependencies can have a substantial effect on evolutionary interpretations, but the developmental underpinnings of character inter-dependence remain obscure because experiments frequently do not provide detailed resolution of morphological characters. Here we show experimentally and computationally how gradual modification of development differentially affects characters in the mouse dentition. We found that intermediate phenotypes could be produced by gradually adding ectodysplas in A (EDA) protein in culture to tooth explants carrying a null mutation in the tooth-patterning gene Eda. By identifying development-based character inter-dependencies, we show how to predict morphological patterns of teeth among mammalian species. Finally, in vivo inhibition of sonic hedgehog signalling in Eda null teeth enabled us to reproduce characters deep in the rodent ancestry. Taken together, evolutionarily informative transitions can be experimentally reproduced, thereby providing development-based expectations for character-state transitions used in evolutionary studies.","[Harjunmaa, Enni; Hakkinen, Teemu; Renvoise, Elodie; Corfe, Ian J.; Mikkola, Marja L.; Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Seidel, Kerstin; Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Craniofacial & Mesenchymal Biol, San Francisco, CA 94114 USA; [Seidel, Kerstin; Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orofacial Sci, San Francisco, CA 94114 USA; [Kallonen, Aki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Div Mat Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Zhang, Zhao-Qun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Evans, Alistair R.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Evans, Alistair R.] Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Genom Bioinformat & Evolut Group, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94114 USA; [Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94114 USA","Jernvall, J (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",ophir.klein@ucsf.edu; jernvall@fastmail.fm,"; Evans, Alistair/D-4239-2011","Corfe, Ian/0000-0002-1824-755X; Klein, Ophir/0000-0002-6254-7082; Evans, Alistair/0000-0002-4078-4693; Salazar, Isaac/0000-0003-1607-0962",Academy of Finland; NIH/NIDCR [R01-DE021420]; NIH [DP2-OD007191]; Australian Research Council; MST [2012CB821904],"We thank M.

Despite the teratogenicity of thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and pomalidomide, these immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) recently emerged as effective treatments for multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion-associated dysplasia. IMiDs target the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)) and promote the ubiquitination of the IKAROS family transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 by CRL4(CRBN). Here we present crystal structures of the DDB1-CRBN complex bound to thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide. The structure establishes that CRBN is a substrate receptor within CRL4(CRBN) and enantioselectively binds IMiDs. Using an unbiased screen, we identified the homeobox transcription factor MEIS2 as an endogenous substrate of CRL4(CRBN). Our studies suggest that IMiDs block endogenous substrates (MEIS2) from binding to CRL4(CRBN) while the ligase complex is recruiting IKZF1 or IKZF3 for degradation. This dual activity implies that small molecules can modulate an E3 ubiquitin ligase and thereby upregulate or downregulate the ubiquitination of proteins.","[Fischer, Eric S.; Boehm, Kerstin; Stadler, Michael B.; Cavadini, Simone; Lingaraju, Gondichatnahalli M.; Thomae, Nicolas H.] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Fischer, Eric S.; Boehm, Kerstin; Stadler, Michael B.; Cavadini, Simone; Lingaraju, Gondichatnahalli M.; Thomae, Nicolas H.] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Lydeard, John R.; Harper, J.

They are also distinguished by lower luminosities. At late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from those of other supernovae(3-6), but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-mass elements(1,7)) suggests a physical connection to normal type Ia supernovae. Supernovae of type Iax are not rare; they occur at a rate between 5 and 30 per cent of the normal type Ia rate(1). The leading models for type Iax supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs that do not completely unbind the star(8-10), implying that they are 'less successful' versions of normal type Ia supernovae, where complete stellar disruption is observed. Here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of the type Iax SN 2012Z in deep pre-explosion imaging. The progenitor system's luminosity, colours, environment and similarity to the progenitor of the Galactic helium nova V445 Puppis(11-13) suggest that SN 2012Z was the explosion of a white dwarf accretingmaterial from a helium-star companion. Observations over the next few years, after SN 2012Z has faded, will either confirm this hypothesis or perhaps show that this super-nova was actually the explosive death of a massive star(14,15).","[McCully, Curtis; Jha, Saurabh W.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Foley, Ryan J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Astron, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Foley, Ryan J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Bildsten, Lars] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Bildsten, Lars] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Kavli Inst Theoret Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Fong, Wen-fai; Kirshner, Robert P.; Marion, G.

Considerable progress in control and manipulation has been achieved for various quantum systems(3-5), but one of the remaining challenges is the implementation of scalable devices. In this regard, individual ions trapped in separate tunable potential wells are promising(6-8). Here we implement the basic features of this approach and demonstrate deterministic tuning of the Coulomb interaction between two ions, independently controlling their local wells. The scheme is suitable for emulating a range of spin-spin interactions, but to characterize the performance of our set-up we select one that entangles the internal states of the two ions with a fidelity of 0.82(1) (the digit inparentheses shows the standard error of the mean). Extension of this building block to a two-dimensional network, which is possible using ion-trap microfabrication processes(9), may provide a new quantum simulator architecture with broad flexibility in designing and scaling the arrangement of ions and their mutual interactions. To perform useful quantum simulations, including those of condensed-matter phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, an array of tens of ions might be sufficient(4,10,11).","[Wilson, A.

Many of these properties depend sensitively on SWCNT structure, which is characterized by the chiral index (n,m) that denotes the length and orientation of the circumferential vector in the hexagonal carbon lattice. Electronic properties are particularly strongly affected, with subtle structural changes switching tubes from metallic to semiconducting with various band-gaps. Monodisperse 'single-chirality' (that is, with a single (n, m) index) SWCNTs are thus needed to fully exploit their technological potential(1,2). Controlled synthesis through catalyst engineering(3-6), end-cap engineering(7) or cloning strategies(8,9), and also tube sorting based on chromatography(10,11), density-gradient centrifugation, electrophoresis and other techniques(12), have delivered SWCNT samples with narrow distributions of tube diameter and a large fraction of a predetermined tube type. But an effective pathway to truly monodisperse SWCNTs remains elusive. The use of template molecules to unambiguously dictate the diameter and chirality of the resulting nanotube(8,13-16) holds great promise in this regard, but has hitherto had only limited practical success(7,17,18). Here we show that this bottom-up strategy can produce targeted nanotubes: we convert molecular precursors into ultrashort singly capped (6,6) 'armchair' nanotube seeds using surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation on a platinum (111) surface, and then elongate these during a subsequent growth phase to produce single-chirality and essentially defect-free SWCNTs with lengths up to a few hundred nanometres. We expect that our on-surface synthesis approach will provide a route to nanotube-based materials with highly optimized properties for applications such as light detectors, photovoltaics, field-effect transistors and sensors(2).","[Sanchez-Valencia, Juan Ramon; Dienel, Thomas; Groening, Oliver; Ruffieux, Pascal; Fasel, Roman] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Shorubalko, Ivan] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Lab Reliabil Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Mueller, Andreas; Jansen, Martin; Amsharov, Konstantin] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Fasel, Roman] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Fasel, R (reprint author), Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",konstantin.amsharov@fau.de; roman.fasel@empa.ch,"Shorubalko, Ivan/E-1089-2011; Sanchez-Valencia, Juan Ramon/K-3253-2014; Groning, Oliver/J-9727-2012; Dienel, Thomas/F-2356-2010; Fasel, Roman/B-5396-2011; Ruffieux, Pascal/E-8227-2010","Shorubalko, Ivan/0000-0001-9868-7303; Sanchez-Valencia, Juan Ramon/0000-0003-2493-4433; Dienel, Thomas/0000-0001-8146-8841; Fasel, Roman/0000-0002-1553-6487; Ruffieux, Pascal/0000-0001-5729-5354","Swiss National Science Foundation; State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation via the COST Action [MP0901]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","This research was supported in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation and by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation via the COST Action MP0901 'NanoTP'.

Several recent models have estimated that these emissions have increased the oceanic mercury inventory by 36-1,313 million moles since the 1500s(2-9). Such predictions have remained largely untested owing to a lack of appropriate historical data and natural archives. Here we report oceanographic measurements of total dissolved mercury and related parameters from several recent expeditions to the Atlantic, Pacific, Southern and Arctic oceans. We find that deep North Atlantic waters and most intermediate waters are anomalously enriched in mercury relative to the deep waters of the South Atlantic, Southern and Pacific oceans, probably as a result of the incorporation of anthropogenic mercury. We estimate the total amount of anthropogenic mercury present in the global ocean to be 290 +/- 680 million moles, with almost two-thirds residing in water shallower than a thousand metres. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic perturbations to the global mercury cycle have led to an approximately 150 per cent increase in the amount of mercury in thermocline waters and have tripled the mercury content of surface waters compared to pre-anthropogenic conditions. This information may aid our understanding of the processes and the depths at which inorganic mercury species are converted into toxic methyl mercury and subsequently bioaccumulated in marine food webs.","[Lamborg, Carl H.; Swarr, Gretchen J.; Munson, Kathleen M.; Ohnemus, Daniel C.; Lam, Phoebe J.; Saito, Mak A.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Hammerschmidt, Chad R.; Bowman, Katlin L.] Wright State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Heimbuerger, Lars-Eric] Univ Toulouse 3, IRD, CNRS, Observ Midi Pyrenees,Lab Geosci Environm, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Rijkenberg, Micha J.

Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of cartilage destruction in rheumatic diseases(1), but our understanding of the upstream mechanisms leading to production of interleukin-1 beta in rheumatoid arthritis is limited by the absence of suitable mouse models of the disease in which inflammasomes contribute to pathology. Myeloid-cell-specific deletion of the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility gene A20/Tnfaip3 in mice (A20(myel-KO) mice) triggers a spontaneous erosive polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in patients(2). Rheumatoid arthritis in A20(myel-KO) mice is not rescued by deletion of tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (ref. 2). Here we show, however, that it crucially relies on the Nlrp3 inflammasome and interleukin-1 receptor signalling. Macrophages lacking A 20 have increased basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression levels of the inflammasome adaptor Nlrp3 and proIL-beta b. As a result, A 20-deficiency in macrophages significantly enhances Nlrp3 inflammasome- mediated caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and interleukin-1 beta secretion by soluble and crystalline Nlrp3 stimuli. In contrast, activation of the Nlrc4 and AIM2 inflammasomes is not altered. Importantly, increased Nlrp3 inflammasome activation contributes to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo, because deletion of Nlrp3, caspase-1 and the interleukin-1 receptor markedly protects against rheumatoid-arthritis-associated inflammation and cartilage destruction in A20(myel-KO) mice. These results reveal A20 as a novel negative regulator of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, and describe A(20myel-KO) mice as the first experimental model to study the role of inflammasomes in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis.","[Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Fossoul, Amelie; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Fossoul, Amelie; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Jacques, Peggy; Verheugen, Eveline; Elewaut, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Rheumatol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vogel, Peter; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Beyaert, Rudi; van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent VIB, Inflammat Res Ctr, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Beyaert, Rudi; van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent, Dept Biomed Mol Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium","Lamkanfi, M (reprint author), Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",mohamed.lamkanfi@vib-ugent.be,"van Loo, Geert/C-1505-2009; Beyaert, Rudi/B-2589-2009; Elewaut, Dirk/K-6831-2014","Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi/0000-0002-6395-6443; Beyaert, Rudi/0000-0002-5704-582X","Ghent University [BOF14/GOA/013]; European Research Council [281600]; FWO [G030212N, 1.2.201.10.N.00, 1.5.122.11.N.00, Odysseus-G091908, G061910N, G016812N]; Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation; Ghent University Group-ID MRP; National Institutes of Health [AR056296, CA163507, AI101935]; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities","We thank R.

However, it remains unclear when and where the viral reservoir is seeded during acute infection and the extent to which it is susceptible to early anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Here we show that the viral reservoir is seeded rapidly after mucosal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus monkeys and before systemic viraemia. We initiated suppressive ART in groups of monkeys on days 3, 7, 10 and 14 after intrarectal SIVMAC251 infection. Treatment with ART on day 3 blocked the emergence of viral RNA and proviral DNA in peripheral blood and also substantially reduced levels of proviral DNA in lymph nodes and gastrointestinal mucosa as compared with treatment at later time points. In addition, treatment on day 3 abrogated the induction of SIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Nevertheless, after discontinuation of ART following 24 weeks of fully suppressive therapy, virus rebounded in all animals, although the monkeys that were treated on day 3 exhibited a delayed viral rebound as compared with those treated on days 7, 10 and 14. The time to viral rebound correlated with total viraemia during acute infection and with proviral DNA at the time of ART discontinuation. These data demonstrate that the viral reservoir is seeded rapidly after intrarectal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys, during the 'eclipse' phase, and before detectable viraemia. This strikingly early seeding of the refractory viral reservoir raises important new challenges for HIV-1 eradication strategies.","[Whitney, James B.; Sanisetty, Srisowmya; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo; Liu, Jinyan; Shetty, Mayuri; Parenteau, Lily; Cabral, Crystal; Shields, Jennifer; Blackmore, Stephen; Smith, Jeffrey Y.; Brinkman, Amanda L.; Peter, Lauren E.; Mathew, Sheeba I.; Smith, Kaitlin M.; Borducchi, Erica N.; Barouch, Dan H.] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Ctr Virol & Vaccine Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Whitney, James B.; Barouch, Dan H.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hill, Alison L.; Rosenbloom, Daniel I.

Most MPN patients have a common acquired mutation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in HSCs1-4 that renders this kinase constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell expansion. The bone marrow microenvironment might contribute to the clinical outcomes of this common event. We previously showed that bone marrow nestin(+) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres regulate normal HSCs5,6. Here we demonstrate that abrogation of this regulatory circuit is essential for MPN pathogenesis. Sympathetic nerve fibres, supporting Schwann cells and nestin(+) MSCs are consistently reduced in the bone marrow of MPN patients and mice expressing the human JAK2(V617F) mutation in HSCs. Unexpectedly, MSC reduction is not due to differentiation but is caused by bone marrow neural damage and Schwann cell death triggered by interleukin-1 beta produced by mutant HSCs. In turn, in vivo depletion of nestin(+) cells or their production of CXCL12 expanded mutant HSC number and accelerated MPN progression. In contrast, administration of neuroprotective or sympathomimetic drugs prevented mutant HSC expansion. Treatment with beta(3)-adrenergic agonists that restored the sympathetic regulation of nestin(+) MSCs5,6 prevented the loss of these cells and blocked MPN progression by indirectly reducing the number of leukaemic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that mutant-HSC-driven niche damage critically contributes to disease manifestation in MPN and identify niche-forming MSCs and their neural regulation as promising therapeutic targets.","[Arranz, Lorena; Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel; Martin-Perez, Daniel; Isern, Joan; Langa, Xavier; Mendez-Ferrer, Simon] CNIC, Stem Cell Niche Pathophysiol Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Tzankov, Alexandar; Lundberg, Pontus; Schwaller, Juerg; Skoda, Radek C.] Univ Basel Hosp, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Muntion, Sandra] IBSAL Hosp Univ Salamanca, Dept Haematol, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Tzeng, Yi-Shiuan; Lai, Dar-Ming] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10002, Taiwan","Mendez-Ferrer, S (reprint author), CNIC, Stem Cell Niche Pathophysiol Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain.",smendez@cnic.es,"schwaller, juerg/A-3044-2016; Isern, Joan/C-1250-2017; Mendez-Ferrer, Simon/L-8088-2014","Isern, Joan/0000-0002-1401-9779; Mendez-Ferrer, Simon/0000-0002-9805-9988; Tzankov, Alexandar/0000-0002-1100-3819; ARRANZ, LORENA/0000-0002-5896-4238","Fundacion CNIC; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (TerCel, Spanish Cell Therapy Network) [SAF-2011-30308]; ConSEPOC-Comunidad de Madrid [S2010/BMD-2542]; Ramon y Cajal Program [RYC-2009-04703/2011-09726]; Marie Curie grants [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-RG-294262/294096]; Swiss National Science Foundation [310000-120724/1, 32003BB_135712/1]; Swiss Cancer League [KLS-02398-02-2009]; European Hematology Association; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank S.

The well-characterized myelocytomatosis (MYC) oncogene resides in the 8q24.21 region and is consistently co-gained with an adjacent 'gene desert' of approximately 2 megabases that contains the long non-coding RNA gene PVT1, the CCDC26 gene candidate and the GSDMC gene. Whether low copy-number gain of one or more of these genes drives neoplasia is not known. Here we use chromosome engineering in mice to show that a single extra copy of either the Myc gene or the region encompassing Pvt1, Ccdc26 and Gsdmc fails to advance cancer measurably, whereas a single supernumerary segment encompassing all four genes successfully promotes cancer. Gain of PVT1 long non-coding RNA expression was required for high MYC protein levels in 8q24-amplified human cancer cells. PVT1 RNA and MYC protein expression correlated in primary human tumours, and copy number of PVT1 was co-increased in more than 98% of MYC-copy-increase cancers. Ablation of PVT1 from MYC-driven colon cancer line HCT116 diminished its tumorigenic potency. As MYC protein has been refractory to small-molecule inhibition, the dependence of high MYC protein levels on PVT1 long non-coding RNA provides a much needed therapeutic target.","[Tseng, Yuen-Yi; Gong, Wuming; Akiyama, Ryutaro; Kawakami, Hiroko; Ronning, Peter; Reuland, Brian; Guenther, Kacey; Essig, Jaclyn; Largaespada, David A.; Marahrens, York; Kawakami, Yasuhiko; Bagchi, Anindya] Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Moriarity, Branden S.; Gong, Wuming; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Otto, George M.; O'Sullivan, M.

To better characterize colorectal cancer (CRC) development we conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment of 103 matched tumour and normal colon mucosa samples from Danish CRC patients, 90 of which were germline-genotyped. By investigating allele-specific expression (ASE) we show that the germline genotypes remain important determinants of allelic gene expression in tumours. Using the changes in ASE in matched pairs of samples we discover 71 genes with excess of somaticc is-regulatory effects in CRC, suggesting a cancer driver role. We correlate genotypes and gene expression to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and find 1,693 and 948 eQTLs in normal samples and tumours, respectively. We estimate that 36% of the tumour eQTLs are exclusive to CRC and show that this specificity is partially driven by increased expression of specific transcription factors and changes in methylation patterns. We show that tumour-specific eQTLs are more enriched for low CRC genome-wide association study (GWAS) P values than shared eQTLs, which suggests that some of the GWAS variants are tumour specific regulatory variants. Importantly, tumour-specific eQTL genes also accumulate more somatic mutations when compared to the shared eQTL genes, raising the possibility that they constitute germline-derived cancer regulatory drivers. Collectively the integration of genome and the transcriptome reveals a substantial number of putative somatic and germline cis-regulatory cancer changes that may have a role in tumorigenesis.","[Ongen, Halit; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Planchon, Alexandra; Padioleau, Ismael; Bielser, Deborah; Romano, Luciana; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Ongen, Halit; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Planchon, Alexandra; Padioleau, Ismael; Bielser, Deborah; Romano, Luciana; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.] Univ Geneva, Inst Genet & Genom Geneva IGE3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Ongen, Halit; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Planchon, Alexandra; Padioleau, Ismael; Bielser, Deborah; Romano, Luciana; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Andersen, Claus L.; Bramsen, Jesper B.; Oster, Bodil; Rasmussen, Mads H.; Orntoft, Torben F.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Mol Med, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Sandoval, Juan; Vidal, Enrique] Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, Canc Epigenet & Biol Program PEBC, Barcelona 08908, Catalonia, Spain; [Whiffin, Nicola; Houlston, Richard S.] Inst Canc Res, Div Genet & Epidemiol, Sutton SM2 5NG, Surrey, England; [Tomlinson, Ian] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Tomlinson, Ian] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford NIHR Comprehens Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Esteller, Manel] Univ Barcelona, Sch Med, Dept Physiol Sci 2, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Esteller, Manel] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Ongen, H (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",halit.ongen@unige.ch; emmanouil.dermitzakis@unige.ch,"Andersen, Claus Lindbjerg/A-9217-2012; Vidal, Enrique/A-9455-2014; Esteller, Manel/L-5956-2014; Vidal, Enrique/J-7118-2015; Andersen, Claus/C-1477-2017; Ferreira, Pedro/J-6379-2013","Andersen, Claus Lindbjerg/0000-0002-7406-2103; Vidal, Enrique/0000-0002-4217-1807; Esteller, Manel/0000-0003-4490-6093; Vidal, Enrique/0000-0002-4217-1807; Andersen, Claus/0000-0002-7406-2103; Ferreira, Pedro/0000-0003-3838-8664; Whiffin, Nicola/0000-0003-1554-6594; Houlston, Richard/0000-0002-5268-0242; Ongen, Halit/0000-0002-4197-5790","European Commission SYSCOL FP7 [UE7-SYSCOL-258236]; European Research Council [ERC 260927]; Louis Jeantet Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation [130326, 130342]; NIH-NIMH [MH090941]; Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation; John and Birthe Meyer Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research (Medical Sciences); Danish Council for Strategic Research; Danish Cancer Society; Cellex Foundation; Botin Foundation; Fundacion Olga Torres; Health Department of the Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya); Science Department of the Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya); Cancer Research UK [C1298/A8362]; Oxford Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre;  [090532/Z/09/Z]; ICREA","This study was designed under the SYSCOL project and samples were collected with informed consent in accordance with local law.

Here we characterize the in vivo activity of 7,705 Drosophila melanogaster enhancer candidates covering 13.5% of the non-coding non-repetitive genome throughout embryogenesis. 3,557 (46%) candidates are active, suggesting a high density with 50,000 to 100,000 developmental enhancers genome-wide. The vast majority of enhancers display specific spatial patterns that are highly dynamic during development. Most appear to regulate their neighbouring genes, suggesting that the cis-regulatory genome is organized locally into domains, which are supported by chromosomal domains, insulator binding and genome evolution. However, 12 to 21 per cent of enhancers appear to skip non-expressed neighbours and regulate a more distal gene. Finally, we computationally identify cis-regulatory motifs that are predictive and required for enhancer activity, as we validate experimentally. This work provides global insights into the organization of an animal regulatory genome and the make-up of enhancer sequences and confirms and generalizes principles from previous studies(1,9). All enhancer patterns are annotated manually with a controlled vocabulary and all results are available through a web interface (http://enhancers.starklab.org), including the raw images of all microscopy slides for manual inspection at arbitrary zoom levels.","[Kvon, Evgeny Z.; Kazmar, Tomas; Stampfel, Gerald; Yanez-Cuna, J.

Despite their importance, the properties governing enhancer-promoter interactions and their dynamics during embryogenesis remain unclear. At the beta-globin locus, enhancer-promoter interactions appear dynamic and cell-type specific(1,2), whereas at the HoxD locus they are stable and ubiquitous, being present in tissues where the target genes are not expressed(3,4). The extent to which preformed enhancer-promoter conformations exist at other, more typical, loci and how transcription is eventually triggered is unclear. Here we generated a high-resolution map of enhancer three-dimensional contacts during Drosophila embryogenesis, covering two developmental stages and tissue contexts, at unprecedented resolution. Although local regulatory interactions are common, long-range interactions are highly prevalent within the compact Drosophila genome. Each enhancer contacts multiple enhancers, and promoters with similar expression, suggesting a role in their co-regulation. Notably, most interactions appear unchanged between tissue context and across development, arising before gene activation, and are frequently associated with paused RNA polymerase. Our results indicate that the general topology governing enhancer contacts is conserved from flies to humans and suggest that transcription initiates from preformed enhancer-promoter loops through release of paused polymerase.","[Ghavi-Helm, Yad; Klein, Felix A.; Pakozdi, Tibor; Ciglar, Lucia; Huber, Wolfgang; Furlong, Eileen E.

YiiP is a proton-coupled zinc transporter found in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli. Its transport site receives protons from water molecules that gain access to its hydrophobic environment and transduces the energy of an inward proton gradient to drive Zn(II) efflux(1,2). This membrane protein is a well characterized member3- 7 of the family of cation diffusion facilitators that occurs at all phylogenetic levels(8-10). Here we show, using X-ray-mediated hydroxyl radical labelling of YiiP and mass spectrometry, that Zn( II) binding triggers a highly localized, all-or-nothing change of water accessibility to the transport site and an adjacent hydrophobic gate. Milli-secondtime-resolved dynamics reveal a concerted and reciprocal pattern of accessibility changes along a trans membrane helix, suggesting a rigid-body helical re-orientation linked to Zn( II) binding that triggers the closing of the hydrophobic gate. The gated water access to the transport site enables a stationary proton gradient to facilitate the conversion of zinc-binding energy to the kinetic power stroke of a vectorial zinc transport. The kinetic details provide energetic insights intoaproton-coupled active-transport reaction.","[Gupta, Sayan; Cheng, Jie; D'Mello, Rhijuta] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Synchrotron Biosci, Cleveland, OH 44109 USA; [Gupta, Sayan; D'Mello, Rhijuta; Chance, Mark R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Prote & Bioinformat, Cleveland, OH 44109 USA; [Chai, Jin; Fu, Dax] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Cheng, Jie; Fu, Dax] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Fu, D (reprint author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",mrc16@case.edu; dfu3@jhmi.edu,,"chai, jin/0000-0002-4760-5811","National Institutes of Health [R01GM065137]; Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-98CH10886]; Physical Biosciences Program, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the DOE; National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [P30-EB-09998, R01-EB-09688]; DOE [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","We dedicate this work to the memory of Peter C.

Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen(mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis.","[Collisson, Eric A.; Taylor, Barry S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Brooks, Angela N.; Garraway, Levi; Beroukhim, Rameen; Meyerson, Matthew; Spellman, Paul T.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brooks, Angela N.; Lee, William; Ladanyi, Marc; Schultz, Nikolaus; Shen, Ronglai; Travis, William D.; Aksoy, B.

Here we identify a molecular pathway for interference by analysing crossover patterns in budding yeast. Topoisomerase II plays a central role, thus identifying a new function for this critical molecule. SUMOylation (of topoisomerase II and axis component Red1) and ubiquitin-mediated removal of SUMOylated proteins are also required. The findings support the hypothesis that crossover interference involves accumulation, relief and redistribution of mechanical stress along the protein/ DNA meshwork of meiotic chromosome axes, with topoisomerase II required to adjust spatial relationships among DNA segments.","[Zhang, Liangran; Wang, Shunxin; Yin, Shen; Kleckner, Nancy] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hong, Soogil; Kim, Keun P.] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 156756, South Korea","Kleckner, N (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kleckner@fas.harvard.edu,,"zhang, liangran/0000-0002-8550-6742","National Institutes of Health [RO1 GM044794]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2012-M3A9C6050367]","We thank M.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 is of considerable interest as a drug target in the treatment of fragile X syndrome, autism, depression, anxiety, addiction and movement disorders. Here we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane domain of the human receptor in complex with the negative allosteric modulator, mavoglurant. The structure provides detailed insight into the architecture of the transmembrane domain of class C receptors including the precise location of the allosteric binding site within the transmem-branedomain and key micro-switches which regulate receptor signalling.

It is interesting to evaluate the incidence of such planar structures in the larger galactic population, because the Local Group may not be a representative environment. Here we report measurements of the velocities of pairs of diametrically opposed satellite galaxies. In the local Universe (redshift z<0.05), we find that satellite pairs out to a distance of 150 kiloparsecs from the galactic centre are preferentially anti-correlated in their velocities (99.994 per cent confidence level), and that the distribution of galaxies in the larger-scale environment (out to distances of about 2 megaparsecs) is strongly clumped along the axis joining the inner satellite pair ( >7 sigma confidence). This may indicate that planes of co-rotating satellites, similar to those seen around the Andromeda galaxy, are ubiquitous, and their coherent motion suggests that they represent a substantial repository of angular momentum on scales of about 100 kiloparsecs.","[Ibata, Neil G.] Lycee Int Pontonniers, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Ibata, Rodrigo A.; Famaey, Benoit] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7550, Observ Astron Strasbourg, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Lewis, Geraint F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney Inst Astron, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Ibata, NG (reprint author), Lycee Int Pontonniers, 1 Rue Pontonniers, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",neil.ibata@gmail.com,"Lewis, Geraint/F-9069-2015","Lewis, Geraint/0000-0003-3081-9319; Famaey, Benoit/0000-0003-3180-9825",Alfred P.

There is at present no consensus on what produces such orbits. Theoretical explanations often invoke interactions with a binary companion star in an orbit that is inclined relative to the planet's orbital plane(4,5). Such mechanisms require significant mutual inclinations between the planetary and binary star orbital planes. The protoplanetary disks in a few young binaries are misaligned(6-12), but often the measurements of these mis-alignments are sensitive only to a small portion of the inner disk, and the three-dimensional misalignment of the bulk of the planet-forming disk mass has hitherto not been determined. Here we report that the protoplanetary disks in the young binary system HK Tauri are misaligned by 60 to 68 degrees, such that one or both of the disks are significantly inclined to the binary orbital plane. Our results demonstrate that the necessary conditions exist for misalignment-driven mechanisms to modify planetary orbits, and that these conditions are present at the time of planet formation, apparently because of the binary formation process.","[Jensen, Eric L.

Consequently, continuously monitoring a quantum system will randomly perturb its natural unitary evolution. The ability to control a quantum system in the presence of these fluctuations is of increasing importance in quantum information processing and finds application in fields ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance(1) to chemical synthesis(2). A detailed understanding of this stochastic evolution is essential for the development of optimized control methods. Here we reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories(3-5) of a superconducting circuit that evolves under the competing influences of continuous weak measurement and Rabi drive. By tracking individual trajectories that evolve between any chosen initial and final states, we can deduce the most probable path through quantum state space. These pre- and post-selected quantum trajectories also reveal the optimal detector signal in the form of a smooth, time-continuous function that connects the desired boundary conditions. Our investigation reveals the rich interplay between measurement dynamics, typically associated with wave function collapse, and unitary evolution of the quantum state as described by the Schrodinger equation. These results and the underlying theory(6), based on a principle of least action, reveal the optimal route from initial to final states, and may inform new quantum control methods for state steering and information processing.","[Weber, S.

Increases in ocean thermal stratification and circulation in proxies across the Eocene-Oligocene transition have been interpreted as a unique signature of gateway opening(2,4),but at present both mechanisms remain possible. Here, using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, we show that the rise of Antarctic glaciation, rather than altered palaeogeography, is best able to explain the observed oceanographic changes. We find that growth of the Antarctic ice sheet caused enhanced northward transport of Antarctic intermediate water and invigorated the formation of Antarctic bottom water, fundamentally reorganizing ocean circulation. Conversely, gateway openings had much less impact on ocean thermal stratification and circulation. Our results support available evidence that CO2 draw down not gateway opening-caused Antarctic ice sheet growth, and further show that these feedbacks in turn altered ocean circulation. The precise timing and rate of glaciation, and thus its impacts on ocean circulation, reflect the balance between potentially positive feedbacks (increases in sea ice extent and enhanced primary productivity) and negative feedbacks (stronger southward heat transport and localized high-latitude warming). The Antarctic ice sheet had a complex, dynamic role in ocean circulation and heat fluxes during its initiation, and these processes are likely to operate in the future.","[Goldner, A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Goldner, A.] Amer Geophys Union, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Herold, N.; Huber, M.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Huber, M.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Inst Earth Ocean & Space Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Goldner, A (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",aarongoldner@gmail.com; matthew.huber@unh.edu,"Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008","Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977","Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) fellowship through the Computational Sciences and Engineering Program at Purdue University; National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0902882, EAR 1049921]; National Center for Atmospheric Research; NSF","A.G. was funded by a Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) fellowship through the Computational Sciences and Engineering Program at Purdue University.

The main constraints from this era come from ancient submillimetre zircon grains(2,3). Some of these zircons date back to similar to 4.4 billion years ago when the Moon, and presumably the Earth, was being pummelled by an enormous flux of extraterrestrial bodies(4). The magnitude and exact timing of these early terrestrial impacts, and their effects on crustal growth and evolution, are unknown. Here we provide a new bombardment model of the Hadean Earth that has been calibrated using existing lunar(4) and terrestrial data(5). We find that the surface of the Hadean Earth was widely reprocessed by impacts through mixing and burial by impact-generated melt. This model may explain the age distribution of Hadean zircons and the absence of early terrestrial rocks. Existing oceans would have repeatedly boiled away into steam atmospheres as a result of large collisions as late as about 4 billion years ago.","[Marchi, S.; Bottke, W.

Ecosystem response to CO2 is complicated by biogeochemical feedbacks(2) but must be understood if carbon storage and associated dampening of climate warming are to be predicted(3). Feedbacks through the hydrological cycle are particularly important(4) and the physiology is well known; elevated CO2 reduces stomatal conductance and increases plant water use efficiency (the amount of water required to produce a unit of plant dry matter)(5). The CO2 response should consequently be strongest when water is limiting(6); although this has been shown in some experiments(7), it is absent frommany(8-11). Here we show that large annual variation in the stimulation of above-ground biomass by elevated CO2 in a mixed C-3/C-4 temperate grassland can be predicted accurately using seasonal rainfall totals; summer rainfall had a positive effect but autumn and spring rainfall had negative effects on the CO2 response. Thus, the elevated CO2 effect mainly depended upon the balance between summer and autumn/spring rainfall. This is partly because high rainfall during cool, moist seasons leads to nitrogen limitation, reducing or even preventing biomass stimulation by elevated CO2. Importantly, the prediction held whether plots were warmed by 2 degrees C or left unwarmed, and was similar for C-3 plants and total biomass, allowing us to make a powerful generalization about ecosystem responses to elevated CO2. This new insight is particularly valuable because climate projections predict large changes in the timing of rainfall, even where annual totals remain static(12). Our findings will help resolve apparent differences in the outcomes of CO2 experiments and improve the formulation and interpretation of models that are insensitive to differences in the seasonal effects of rainfall on the CO2 response(7,13,14).","[Hovenden, Mark J.; Wills, Karen E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Newton, Paul C.

These proteins have a variety of roles that are essential to virulence or parasite growth(7). There is keen interest in understanding how proteins are exported and whether common machineries are involved in trafficking the different classes of exported proteins(8,9). One potential trafficking machine is a protein complex known as the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX)(10). Although PTEX has been linked to the export of one class of exported proteins(10,11), there has been no direct evidence for its role and scope in protein translocation. Here we show, through the generation of two parasite lines defective for essential PTEX components (HSP101 or PTEX150), and analysis of a line lacking the non-essential component TRX2 (ref. 12), greatly reduced trafficking of all classes of exported proteins beyond the double membrane barrier enveloping the parasite. This includes proteins containing the PEXEL motif (RxLxE/Q/D)(1,2) and PEXEL-negative exported proteins (PNEPs)(6). Moreover, the export of proteins destined for expression on the infected erythrocyte surface, including the major virulence factor PfEMP1 in Plasmodium falciparum, was significantly reduced in PTEX knockdown parasites. PTEX function was also essential for blood-stage growth, because even a modest knockdown of PTEX components had a strong effect on the parasite's capacity to complete the erythrocytic cycle both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, as the only known nexus for protein export in Plasmodium parasites, and an essential enzymic machine, PTEX is a prime drug target.","[Elsworth, Brendan; Nie, Catherine Q.; Charnaud, Sarah C.; Sanders, Paul R.; Chan, Jo-Anne; Azevedo, Mauro F.; Beeson, James G.; Crabb, Brendan S.; Gilson, Paul R.] Macfarlane Burnet Inst Med Res & Publ Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Elsworth, Brendan; Charnaud, Sarah C.; Beeson, James G.; Crabb, Brendan S.; Gilson, Paul R.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Matthews, Kathryn; Kalanon, Ming; Chisholm, Scott A.; Counihan, Natalie A.; de Koning-Ward, Tania F.] Deakin Univ, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia; [Shaw, Philip J.] Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol BIOTEC, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Pino, Paco] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Rogerson, Stephen J.; Beeson, James G.; Crabb, Brendan S.] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","de Koning-Ward, TF (reprint author), Deakin Univ, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia.",crabb@burnet.edu.au; gilson@burnet.edu.au; taniad@deakin.edu.au,"de Koning-Ward, Tania/N-3572-2017; Azevedo, Mauro/H-6180-2012","de Koning-Ward, Tania/0000-0001-5810-8063; Rogerson, Stephen/0000-0003-4287-1982; Azevedo, Mauro/0000-0002-5233-2037","National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [1021560, 1025665, 637406]; Victorian State Government; Australian Postgraduate Awards","We thank T.

To enter the host cell, exported proteins must cross the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) within which the parasite resides, but the mechanism remains unclear. A putative Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) has been suggested to be involved for at least one class of exported proteins; however, direct functional evidence for this has been elusive(2-4). Here we show that export across the PVM requires heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), a ClpB-likeAAA+ ATPase component of PTEX. Using a chaperone auto-inhibition strategy, we achieved rapid, reversible ablation of HSP101 function, resulting in a nearly complete block in export with substrates accumulating in the vacuole in both asexual and sexual parasites. Surprisingly, this block extended to all classes of exported proteins, revealing HSP101-dependent translocation across the PVM as a convergent step in the multi-pathway export process. Under export-blocked conditions, association between HSP101 and other components of the PTEX complex was lost, indicating that the integrity of the complex is required for efficient protein export. Our results demonstrate an essential and universal role for HSP101 in protein export and provide strong evidence for PTEX function in protein translocation into the host cell.","[Beck, Josh R.; Oksman, Anna; Goldberg, Daniel E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Muralidharan, Vasant; Oksman, Anna; Goldberg, Daniel E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Muralidharan, Vasant; Oksman, Anna; Goldberg, Daniel E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Goldberg, DE (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",dgoldberg@wustl.edu,,"Muralidharan, Vasant/0000-0001-6367-6284","National Institutes of Health [AI047798, T32-AI007172, AI099156]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants AI047798 to D.E.G., T32-AI007172 to J.R.B. and AI099156 to V.M.

Individual pyramidal cells show stable E/I ratios in time despite fluctuating cortical activity levels. This is because when excitation increases, inhibition increases proportionally through the increased recruitment of inhibitory neurons, a phenomenon referred to as excitation-inhibition balance(3-9). However, little is known about the distribution of E/I ratios across pyramidal cells. Through their highly divergent axons, inhibitory neurons indiscriminately contact most neighbouring pyramidal cells(10,11). Is inhibition homogeneously distributed(12) or is it individually matched to the different amounts of excitation received by distinct pyramidal cells? Here we discover that pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex each receive inhibition in a similar proportion to their excitation. As a consequence, E/I ratios are equalized across pyramidal cells. This matched inhibition is mediated by parvalbumin-expressing but not somatostatin-expressing inhibitory cells and results from the independent adjustment of synapses originating from individual parvalbumin-expressing cells targeting different pyramidal cells. Furthermore, this match is activity-dependent as it is disrupted by perturbing pyramidal cell activity. Thus, the equalization of E/I ratios across pyramidal cells reveals an unexpected degree of order in the spatial distribution of synaptic strengths and indicates that the relationship between the cortex's two opposing forces is stabilized not only in time but also in space.","[Xue, Mingshan; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Neurobiol Sect, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Xue, Mingshan; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Atallah, Bassam V.] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, P-1400038 Lisbon, Portugal; [Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Xue, MS (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mingshanxue@gmail.com; massimo@ucsd.edu,,"Xue, Mingshan/0000-0003-1463-8884",Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"We thank M.

However, inflammation may simultaneously confer both detrimental and beneficial effects. This dichotomy is particularly applicable to type I interferons (IFN-I) which, while contributing to innate control of infection(4-10), also provide target cells for the virus during acute infection, impair CD4 T-cell recovery, and are associated with disease progression(6,11-19). Here we manipulated IFN-I signalling in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) during simian immunodeficiency virus (Sly) transmission and acute infection with two complementary in vivo interventions. We show that blockade of the IFN-I receptor caused reduced antiviral gene expression, increased SIV reservoir size and accelerated CD4 T-cell depletion with progression to AIDS despite decreased T-cell activation. In contrast, IFN-a2a administration initially upreg-ulated expression of antiviral genes and prevented systemic infection. However, continued IFN-a2a treatment induced IFN-I desensitization and decreased antiviral gene expression, enabling infection with increased SIV reservoir size and accelerated CD4 T-cell loss. Thus, the timing of IFN-induced innate responses in acute SIV infection profoundly affects overall disease course and outweighs the detrimental consequences of increased immune activation. Yet, the clinical consequences of manipulation of IFN signalling are difficult to predict in vivo and therapeutic interventions in human studies should be approached with caution.","[Sandler, Netanya G.; Zhu, Richard T.

However, its dynamic patterns have not been analysed at the genome scale in human preimplantation embryos due to technical difficulties and the scarcity of required materials. Here we systematically profile the methylome of human early embryos from the zygotic stage through to post-implantation by reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing. We show that the major wave of genome-wide demethylation is complete at the 2-cell stage, contrary to previous observations in mice. Moreover, the demethylation of the paternal genome is much faster than that of the maternal genome, and by the end of the zygotic stage the genome-wide methylation level in male pronudei is already lower than that in female pronudei. The inverse correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression gradually strengthens during early embryonic development, reaching its peak at the post-implantation stage. Furthermore, we show that active genes, with the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) mark at the promoter regions in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells, are essentially devoid of DNA methylation in both mature gametes and throughout pre-implantation development. Finally, we also show that long interspersed nuclear elements or short interspersed nuclear elements that are evolutionarily young are demethylated to a milder extent compared to older elements in the same family and have higher abundance of transcripts, indicating that early embryos tend to retain higher residual methylation at the evolutionarily younger and more active transposable elements. Our work provides insights into the critical features of the methylome of human early embryos, as well as its functional relation to the regulation of gene expression and the repression of transposable elements.","[Guo, Hongshan; Zhu, Ping; Yan, Liying; Li, Rong; Hu, Boqiang; Lian, Ying; Yan, Jie; Ren, Xiulian; Lin, Shengli; Li, Junsheng; Jin, Xiaohu; Shi, Xiaodan; Liu, Ping; Li, Xianlong; Guo, Fan; Wu, Xinglong; Fan, Xiaoying; Yong, Jun; Wen, Lu; Xie, Sunney X.; Tang, Fuchou; Qiao, Jie] Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Coll Life Sci, Biodynam Opt Imaging Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Guo, Hongshan; Zhu, Ping; Yan, Liying; Li, Rong; Hu, Boqiang; Lian, Ying; Yan, Jie; Ren, Xiulian; Lin, Shengli; Li, Junsheng; Jin, Xiaohu; Shi, Xiaodan; Liu, Ping; Li, Xianlong; Guo, Fan; Wu, Xinglong; Fan, Xiaoying; Yong, Jun; Wen, Lu; Xie, Sunney X.; Tang, Fuchou; Qiao, Jie] Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Coll Life Sci, Ctr Reprod Med, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Ping] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yan, Liying; Li, Rong; Lian, Ying; Yan, Jie; Ren, Xiulian; Lin, Shengli; Li, Junsheng; Jin, Xiaohu; Shi, Xiaodan; Liu, Ping; Qiao, Jie] Minist Educ, Key Lab Assisted Reprod, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoye; Wang, Wei; Wei, Yuan] Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Yong, Jun; Xie, Sunney X.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tang, Fuchou] Minist Educ, Key Lab Cell Proliferat & Differentia, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Tang, FC (reprint author), Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Coll Life Sci, Biodynam Opt Imaging Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",tangfuchou@pku.edu.cn; jie.qiao@263.net,,"Zhu, Ping/0000-0002-4521-7524; Guo, Fan/0000-0002-0165-073X","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB966704, 2011CB944504, 2011CB966303, 2011CB944503]; National Natural Science of China [31322037, 31230047, 31271543, 81170538]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission [Z131100005213006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81000275]; National Key Technologies Research and Development Program [2012BAI32B01]","F.T. and J.Q. were supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB966704, 2011CB944504 and 2011CB966303) and from the National Natural Science of China (31322037, 31230047, 31271543 and 81170538).

This comparatively static landscape is in marked contrast with the events of fertilization, during which the paternal genome is globally reprogrammed. Paternal genome demethylation includes the majority of CpGs, although methylation remains detectable at several notable features(4-7). These dynamics have been extensively characterized in the mouse, with only limited observations available in other mammals, and direct measurements are required to understand the extent to which early embryonic landscapes are conserved(8-10). We present genome-scale DNA methylation maps of human preimplantation development and embryonic stem cell derivation, confirming a transient state of global hypomethylation that includes most CpGs, while sites of residual maintenance are primarily restricted to gene bodies. Although most features share similar dynamics to those in mouse, maternally contributed methylation is divergently targeted to species-specific sets of CpG island promoters that extend beyond known imprint control regions. Retrotransposon regulation is also highly diverse, and transitions from maternally to embryonically expressed elements. Together, our data confirm that paternal genome demethylation is a general attribute of early mammalian development that is characterized by distinct modes of epigenetic regulation.","[Smith, Zachary D.; Chan, Michelle M.; Karnik, Rahul; Regev, Aviv; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Karnik, Rahul; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Humm, Kathryn C.; Karnik, Rahul; Mekhoubad, Shila; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Mekhoubad, Shila; Eggan, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chan, Michelle M.] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Div Reprod Endocrinol & Infertil, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.] Boston IVF, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.; Regev, Aviv] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Eggan, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Meissner, A (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",keggan@scrb.harvard.edu; alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,,"Karnik, Rahul/0000-0002-0400-635X",Harvard Stem Cell Institute; NIH Pioneer Award [5DP10D003958]; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface; HHMI; Center for Excellence in Genome Science from the NHGRI [1P50HG006193-01]; New York Stem Cell Foundation;  [P01GM099117],"We would like to thank all members of the Meissner, Regev and Eggan laboratories, in particular M.

However, the transcriptional machinery contains various enzymatic cofactors that can be targeted for the development of new therapeutic candidates', including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)(4). Here we present the discovery and characterization of a covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, which has the unprecedented ability to target a remote cysteine residue located outside of the canonical kinase domain, providing an unanticipated means of achieving selectivity for CDK7. Cancer cell-line profiling indicates that a subset of cancer cell lines, including human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have exceptional sensitivity to THZ1. Genome-wide analysis in Jurkat T-ALL cells shows that THZ1 disproportionally affects transcription of RUNXI and suggests that sensitivity to THZ I may be due to vulnerability conferred by the RUNX1 super-enhancer and the key role of RUNXI in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of these tumour cells. Pharmacological modulation of CDK7 Ifinase activity may thus provide an approach to identify and treat tumour types that are dependent on transcription for maintenance of the oncogenic state.","[Kwiatkowski, Nicholas; Zhang, Tinghu; Ficarro, Scott B.; Marto, Jarrod A.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kwiatkowski, Nicholas; Zhang, Tinghu; Ficarro, Scott B.; Marto, Jarrod A.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kwiatkowski, Nicholas; Rahl, Peter B.; Abraham, Brian J.; Reddy, Jessica; Hannett, Nancy M.; Young, Richard A.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Reddy, Jessica; Young, Richard A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ficarro, Scott B.; Marto, Jarrod A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Blais Prote Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dastur, Anahita; Amzallag, Arnaud; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Benes, Cyril H.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Dept Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Dastur, Anahita; Amzallag, Arnaud; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Benes, Cyril H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Amzallag, Arnaud; Ramaswamy, Sridhar] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Tesar, Bethany; McMillin, Douglas; Mitsiades, Constantine S.; Brown, Jennifer R.] Harvard Univ, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tesar, Bethany; McMillin, Douglas; Mitsiades, Constantine S.; Brown, Jennifer R.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jenkins, Catherine E.; Weng, Andrew P.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Terry Fox Lab, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Sanda, Takaomi; Look, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Sanda, Takaomi] Natl Univ Singapore, Canc Sci Inst Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore; [Sim, Taebo] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Chem Kinom Res Ctr, Seoul 136791, South Korea; [Sim, Taebo] KU KIST Grad Sch Converging Sci & Technol, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Kim, Nam Doo] Daegu Gyeongbuk Med Innovat Fdn, Taegu 706010, South Korea; [Look, Thomas] Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Gray, NS (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",young@wi.mit.edu; nathanael_gray@dfci.harvard.edu,"Young, Richard/F-6495-2012","Young, Richard/0000-0001-8855-8647; Abraham, Brian/0000-0001-8085-3027","National Institutes of Health [R01 CA130876-04, U54 HG006097-02, CA178860-01, P01 N5047572-10, HG002668, CA109901]; American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship [120272-PF-11-042-01-DMC]; Translational Research Program of the Leukemia Lymphoma Society; American Cancer Society","We thank members of the Gray and Young laboratories for helpful discussions; D.

Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.","[Ripke, Stephan; Neale, Benjamin M.; Farh, Kai-How; Lee, Phil; Bulik-Sullivan, Brendan; Huang, Hailiang; Fromer, Menachem; Goldstein, Jacqueline I.; Daly, Mark J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Analyt & Translat Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ripke, Stephan; Neale, Benjamin M.; Lee, Phil; Bulik-Sullivan, Brendan; Belliveau, Richard A., Jr.; Bergen, Sarah E.; Bevilacqua, Elizabeth; Chambert, Kimberly D.; Fromer, Menachem; Genovese, Giulio; O'Dushlaine, Colm; Scolnick, Edward M.; Smoller, Jordan W.; McCarroll, Steven A.; Moran, Jennifer L.; Palotie, Aarno; Petryshen, Tracey L.; Daly, Mark J.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Stanley Ctr Psychiat Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Neale, Benjamin M.; Huang, Hailiang; Pers, Tune H.; Goldstein, Jacqueline I.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.; Price, Alkes; Stahl, Eli A.; Esko, Tonu; Daly, Mark J.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Med & Populat Genet Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Neale, Benjamin M.; Lee, Phil; Fromer, Menachem; Smoller, Jordan W.; Palotie, Aarno] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Psychiat & Neurodev Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Corvin, Aiden; Cormican, Paul; Donohoe, Gary; Morris, Derek W.; Gill, Michael] Univ Ireland Trinity Coll, Dept Psychiat, Neuropsychiat Genet Res Grp, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Walters, James T.

Genomics has illuminated the extensive intertumoral heterogeneity of medulloblastoma, identifying four distinct molecular subgroups. Group 3 and group 4 subgroup medulloblastomas account for most paediatric cases; yet, oncogenic drivers for these subtypes remain largely unidentified. Here we describe a series of prevalent, highly disparate genomic structural variants, restricted to groups 3 and 4, resulting in specific and mutually exclusive activation of the growth factor independent 1 family proto-oncogenes, GFI1 and GFI1B. Somatic structural variants juxtapose GFI1 or GFI1B coding sequences proximal to active enhancer elements, including super-enhancers, instigating oncogenic activity. Our results, supported by evidence from mouse models, identify GFI1 and GFI1B as prominent medulloblastoma oncogenes and implicate 'enhancer hijacking' as an efficient mechanism driving oncogene activation in a childhood cancer.","[Northcott, Paul A.; Erkek, Serap; Kawauchi, Daisuke; Sturm, Dominik; Jones, David T.

The non-catalytic nine-subunit exosome core (Exo9) features a prominent central channel. Although RNA can pass through the channel to engage Rrp44, it is not clear how RNA is directed to Rrp6 or whether Rrp6 uses the central channel. Here we report a 3.3 angstrom crystal structure of a ten-subunit RNA exosome complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae composed of the Exo9 core and Rrp6 bound to single-stranded poly(A) RNA. The Rrp6 catalytic domain rests on top of the Exo9 S1/KH ring above the central channel, the RNA 3' end is anchored in the Rrp6 active site, and the remaining RNA traverses the S1/KH ring in an opposite orientation to that observed in a structure of a Rrp44-containing exosome complex. Solution studies with human and yeast RNA exosome complexes suggest that the RNA path to Rrp6 is conserved and dependent on the integrity of the S1/KH ring. Although path selection to Rrp6 or Rrp44 is stochastic in vitro, the fate of a particular RNA may be determined in vivo by the manner in which cofactors present RNA to the RNA exosome.","[Wasmuth, Elizabeth V.; Januszyk, Kurt; Lima, Christopher D.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wasmuth, Elizabeth V.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Louis Gerstner Jr Grad Sch Biomed Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lima, Christopher D.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Lima, CD (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Struct Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",limac@mskcc.org,,"Lima, Christopher/0000-0002-9163-6092","US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [F31GM097910, R01GM079196]","We thank NE-CAT beamlines (Advanced Photon Source) supported by P41GM103403 (NIH NIGMS).

It has been proposed that the powerful jets of relativistic particles (such as electrons) launched by some active nuclei can both accelerate(5-7) and heat(8) the molecular gas, which often dominates the mass budgets of the outflows(5,9). Clear evidence for this mechanism, in the form of detailed associations between the molecular gas kinematics and features in the radio-emitting jets, has however been lacking. Here we report that the warm molecular hydrogen gas in the western radio lobe of the Seyfert galaxy IC 5063 is moving at high velocities-up to about 600 kilometres per second-relative to the galaxy disk. This suggests that the molecules have been accelerated by fast shocks driven into the interstellar medium by the expanding radio jets. These results demonstrate the general feasibility of accelerating molecular outflows in fast shocks driven by active nuclei.","[Tadhunter, C.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England; [Morganti, R.; Oonk, J.

In quantum error correction, information is redundantly stored in a large quantum state space and one or more observables must be monitored to reveal the occurrence of an error, without disturbing the information encoded in an unknown quantum state. Such observables, typically multi-quantum-bit parities, must correspond to a special symmetry property inherent in the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or error syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition way (projecting without further perturbing the state) and more quickly than errors occur. Previously, quantum non-demolition measurements of quantum jumps between states of well-defined energy have been performed in systems such as trapped ions(1-3), electrons(4), cavity quantum electrodynamics(5,6), nitrogen-vacancy centres(7-9) and superconducting quantum bits(10,11). So far, however, no fast and repeated monitoring of an error syndrome has been achieved. Here we track the quantum jumps of a possible error syndrome, namely the photon number parity of a microwave cavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla quantum bit, whose only role is to facilitate quantum state manipulation and measurement. This quantity is just the error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a hardware efficient protected quantum memory using Schrodinger cat states (quantum superpositions of different coherent states of light) in a harmonic oscillator(12). We demonstrate the projective nature of this measurement onto a region of state space with well-defined parity by observing the collapse of a coherent state onto even or odd cat states. The measurement is fast compared with the cavity lifetime, has a high single-shot fidelity and has a 99.8 per cent probability per single measurement of leaving the parity unchanged. In combination with the deterministic encoding of quantum information in cat states realized earlier(13,14), the quantum non-demolition parity tracking that we demonstrate represents an important step towards implementing an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit.","[Sun, L.; Petrenko, A.; Leghtas, Z.; Vlastakis, B.; Kirchmair, G.; Sliwa, K.

However, widespread application of magnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient mechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current and power(1). There has been considerable recent progress in this effort; in particular, it has been discovered that spin-orbit interactions in heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers can produce strong current-driven torques on the magnetic layer(2-11), via the spin Hall effect(12,13) in the heavy metal or the Rashba-Edelstein effect(14,15) in the ferromagnet. In the search for materials to provide even more efficient spin-orbit-induced torques, some proposals(16-19) have suggested topological insulators(20,21), which possess a surface state in which the effects of spin-orbit coupling are maximal in the sense that an electron's spin orientation is fixed relative to its propagation direction. Here we report experiments showing that charge current flowing in-plane in a thin film of the topological insulator bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) at room temperature can indeed exert a strong spin-transfer torque on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni81Fe19) thin film, with a direction consistent with that expected from the topological surface state. We find that the strength of the torque per unit charge current density in Bi2Se3 is greater than for any source of spin-transfer torque measured so far, even for non-ideal topological insulator films in which the surface states coexist with bulk conduction. Our data suggest that topological insulators could enable very efficient electrical manipulation of magnetic materials at room temperature, for memory and logic applications.","[Mellnik, A.

However, the same thermokarst lakes can also sequester carbon(5), and it remains uncertain whether carbon uptake by thermokarst lakes can offset their greenhouse gas emissions. Here we use field observations of Siberian permafrost exposures, radiocarbon dating and spatial analyses to quantify Holocene carbon stocks and fluxes in lake sediments overlying thawed Pleistocene-aged permafrost. We find that carbon accumulation in deep thermokarst-lake sediments since the last deglaciation is about 1.6 times larger than the mass of Pleistocene-aged permafrost carbon released as greenhouse gases when the lakes first formed. Although methane and carbon dioxide emissions following thaw lead to immediate radiative warming, carbon uptake in peat-rich sediments occurs over millennial timescales. We assess thermokarst-lake carbon feedbacks to climate with an atmospheric perturbation model and find that thermokarst basins switched from a net radiative warming to a net cooling climate effect about 5,000 years ago. High rates of Holocene carbon accumulation in 20 lake sediments (47 +/- 10 grams of carbon per square metre per year; mean +/- standard error) were driven by thermokarst erosion and deposition of terrestrial organic matter, by nutrient release from thawing permafrost that stimulated lake productivity and by slow decomposition in cold, anoxic lake bottoms. When lakes eventually drained, permafrost formation rapidly sequestered sediment carbon. Our estimate of about 160 petagrams of Holocene organic carbon in deep lake basins of Siberia and Alaska increases the circumpolar peat carbon pool estimate for permafrost regions by over 50 per cent (ref. 6). The carbon in perennially frozen drained lake sediments may become vulnerable to mineralization as permafrost disappears(7-9), potentially negating the climate stabilization provided by thermokarst lakes during the late Holocene.","[Anthony, K.

However, because a large fraction of the magma produced on the Earth does not erupt at the surface(2,5), determinations of magma fluxes are rare and this compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Here we show that age distributions of zircons, a mineral often present in crustal magmatic rocks(6), in combination with thermal modelling, provide an accurate means of retrieving magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as a function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated in the Earth's crust. Our approach produces results that are consistent with independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. Analysis of existing age population data sets using our method suggests that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at different characteristic average fluxes. We anticipate that more extensive and complete magma flux data sets will serve to clarify the control that the global heat flux exerts on the frequency of geological events such as volcanic eruptions, and to determine the main factors controlling the distribution of resources on our planet.","[Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs] Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland","Caricchi, L (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, Rue Maraichers 13, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",luca.caricchi@unige.ch,,"Schaltegger, Urs/0000-0003-4404-8607",University of Geneva; Swiss National Science Foundation,"We thank C.

An unusual opportunity is afforded by three decades of individual-based data collected from a declining population of Antarctic fur seals in the South Atlantic. Here, climate change has reduced prey availability and caused a significant decline in seal birth weight. However, the mean age and size of females recruiting into the breeding population are increasing. We show that such females have significantly higher heterozygosity (a measure of within-individual genetic variation) than their non-recruiting siblings and their own mothers. Thus, breeding female heterozygosity has increased by 8.5% per generation over the last two decades. Nonetheless, as heterozygosity is not inherited from mothers to daughters, substantial heterozygote advantage is not transmitted from one generation to the next and the decreasing viability of homozygous individuals causes the population to decline. Our results provide compelling evidence that selection due to climate change is intensifying, with far-reaching consequences for demography as well as phenotypic and genetic variation.","[Forcada, Jaume] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Hoffman, Joseph Ivan] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany","Forcada, J (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",jfor@bas.ac.uk,"hoffman, joseph/K-7725-2012","hoffman, joseph/0000-0001-5895-8949",Marie Curie FP7-Reintegration-Grant within the 7th European Community Framework Programme [PCIG-GA-2011-303618]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft standard grant [HO 5122/3-1],"The authors thank the many fieldworkers who have contributed to data collection over the years.

In many cases the coordinated differentiation of presynaptic and postsynaptic domains implicates trans-synaptic interactions between membrane-associated proteins such as neurexins and neuroligins(1-3). The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction (NMJ) provides a genetically tractable system in which to analyse the segregation of neurotransmitter receptors, because muscle cells receive excitatory innervation from cholinergic neurons and inhibitory innervation from GABAergic neurons(4). Here we show that Ce-Punctin/madd-4 (ref.5), the C. elegans orthologue of mammalian punctin-1 and punctin-2, encodes neurally secreted isoforms that specify the excitatory or inhibitory identity of postsynaptic NMJ domains. These proteins belong to the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin repeats)like family, a class of extracellular matrix proteins related to the ADAM proteases but devoid of proteolytic activity(6). Ce-Punctin deletion causes the redistribution of synaptic acetylcholine and GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors into extrasynaptic clusters, whereas neuronal presynaptic boutons remain unaltered. Alternative promoters generate different Ce-Punctin isoforms with distinct functions. A short isoform is expressed by cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons and localizes to excitatory and inhibitory NMJs, whereas long isoforms are expressed exclusively by cholinergic motoneurons and are confined to cholinergic NMJs. The differential expression of these isoforms controls the congruence between presynaptic and postsynaptic domains: specific disruption of the short isoform relocalizes GABAA receptors from GABAergic to cholinergic synapses, whereas expression of a long isoform in GABAergic neurons recruits acetylcholine receptors to GABAergic NMJs. These results identify Ce-Punctin as a previously unknown synaptic organizer and show that presynaptic and postsynaptic domain identities can be genetically uncoupled in vivo. Because human punctin-2 was identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia(7), ADAMTS-like proteins may also control synapse organization in the mammalian central nervous system.","[Pinan-Lucarre, Berangere; Tu, Haijun; Pierron, Marie; Cruceyra, Pablo Ibanez; Zhan, Hong; Stigloher, Christian; Bessereau, Jean-Louis] Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pinan-Lucarre, Berangere; Tu, Haijun; Pierron, Marie; Zhan, Hong; Bessereau, Jean-Louis] Univ Lyon 1, CGphiMC UMR CNRS 5534, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Richmond, Janet E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Bessereau, JL (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France.",jean-louis.bessereau@univ-lyon1.fr,"Stigloher, Christian/E-4762-2015; Bessereau, Jean-Louis/M-2988-2017","Stigloher, Christian/0000-0001-6941-2669; Bessereau, Jean-Louis/0000-0002-3088-7621; Pinan-Lucarre, Berangere/0000-0002-6866-4714","National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Neuropole de Recherche Francilien; Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes; Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-BLAN-1618-01, ANR-11-BSV4-019]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale ('Equipe FRM' grant)","We thank C.

In the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex, layer 4 (L4) neurons receive mutually exclusive input originating from two thalamic nuclei(7,8): the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys tactile input(9,10), and the posterior nucleus (Po), which conveys modulatory and nociceptive input(11-14). Recently, we have shown that L4 neuron identity is not fully committed postnatally(15), implying a capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during cortical circuit assembly. Here we investigate whether the cell-type-specific molecular and functional identity of L4 neurons is instructed by the origin of their TC input. Genetic ablation of the VB at birth resulted in an anatomical and functional rewiring of Po projections onto L4 neurons in S1. This induced acquisition of Po input led to a respecification of postsynaptic L4 neurons, which developed functional molecular features of Po-target neurons while repressing VB-target traits. Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to noxious stimuli, in sharp contrast to the normal segregation of these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These findings reveal a behaviourally relevant TC-input-type-specific control over the molecular and functional differentiation of postsynaptic L4 neurons and cognate intracortical circuits, which instructs the development of modality-specific neuronal and circuit properties during corticogenesis.","[Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Hosp Geneva, Clin Neurol, Dept Clin Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Inst Genet & Genom Geneva IGE3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Jabaudon, D (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",denis.jabaudon@unige.ch,"Luscher, Christian/A-2496-2011","Luscher, Christian/0000-0001-7917-4596; Vitali, Ilaria/0000-0001-9536-0292; Jabaudon, Denis/0000-0003-2438-4769; Telley, Ludovic/0000-0002-5041-1997",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PP00P3_123447]; Leenaards Foundation; Synapsis Foundation; NARSAD Foundation; Ambizione grant from the SNF; Gertrude von Meissner Foundation; SNF; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI); SNF [31003A-135631]; EMBO; International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation,"We thank S.

Since December 2013, three human cases of H10N8 infection have been reported, two of whom are known to have died. To gather evidence relating to the epidemic potential of H10 we have determined the structure of the haemagglutinin of a previously isolated avian H10 virus and we present here results relating especially to its receptor-binding properties, as these are likely to be major determinants of virus transmissibility. Our results show, first, that the H10 virus possesses high avidity for human receptors and second, from the crystal structure of the complex formed by avian H10 haemagglutinin with human receptor, it is clear that the conformation of the bound receptor has characteristics of both the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus(2) and the human H7 viruses isolated from patients in 2013 (ref. 3). We conclude that avian H10N8 virus has sufficient avidity for human receptors to account for its infection of humans but that its preference for avian receptors should make avian receptor-rich human airway mucins(4) an effective block to widespread infection. In terms of surveillance, particular attention will be paid to the detection of mutations in the receptor-binding site of the H10 haemagglutinin that decrease its avidity for avian receptor, and could enable it to be more readily transmitted between humans.","[Vachieri, Sebastien G.; Xiong, Xiaoli; Collins, Patrick J.; Walker, Philip A.; Martin, Stephen R.; Haire, Lesley F.; Zhang, Ying; McCauley, John W.; Gamblin, Steven J.; Skehel, John J.] MRC Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England","Gamblin, SJ (reprint author), MRC Natl Inst Med Res, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk; skeheljj@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","Medical Research Council [U117584222, U117570592, U117585868]","We thank N.

The most common somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event(3). To investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used a BRAF(V600E) mouse model. In mice expressing BRAF(V600E) in their melanocytes, a single dose of UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. Here we show that sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB sun protection factor (SPF) 50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection. The UVR-exposed tumours showed increased numbers of single nucleotide variants and we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor in approximately 40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in human non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not thought to have a major role in melanoma(4). However, we show that, in mice, mutant Trp53 accelerated BRAF(V600E)-driven melanomagenesis, and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence of UVR-induced DNA damage inhuman melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans(5). Furthermore, we identify TP53/Trp53 as a UVR-target gene that cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to induce melanoma, providing molecular insight into how UVR accelerates melanomagenesis. Our study validates public health campaigns that promote sunscreen protection for individuals at risk of melanoma.","[Viros, Amaya; Sanchez-Laorden, Berta; Furney, Simon J.; Hogan, Kate; Ejiama, Sarah; Girotti, Maria Romina; Cook, Martin; Marais, Richard] Univ Manchester, Canc Res UK Manchester Inst, Mol Oncol Grp, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Pedersen, Malin; Rae, Joel; Dhomen, Nathalie; Marais, Richard] Inst Canc Res, Signal Transduct Team, London SW3 6JB, England; [Cook, Martin] Royal Surrey Cty Hosp, Guildford GU2 7XX, Surrey, England","Marais, R (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Canc Res UK Manchester Inst, Mol Oncol Grp, Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England.",richard.marais@cruk.manchester.ac.uk,"Sanchez-Laorden, Berta/T-2177-2017","Sanchez-Laorden, Berta/0000-0002-6499-6332; Marais, Richard/0000-0001-7484-4183; Furney, Simon/0000-0002-8920-6800","Cancer Research UK [C107/A10433, C5759/A12328, A13540, A17240]; Wenner-Gren Foundations; Stockholm; Teggerstiftelsen; FEBS Long-Term Fellowship","This work was supported by Cancer Research UK (C107/A10433; C5759/A12328; A13540; A17240), the Wenner-Gren Foundations, Stockholm, Teggerstiftelsen (M.P.) and a FEBS Long-Term Fellowship (B.S.-L.).

During mitogenic stimulation of primary lymphocytes, MYC promotes an increase in the expression of virtually all genes(1). In contrast, MYC-driven tumour cells differ from normal cells in the expression of specific sets of up-and downregulated genes that have considerable prognostic value(5-7). To understand this discrepancy, we studied the consequences of inducible expression and depletion of MYC in human cells and murine tumour models. Changes in MYC levels activate and repress specific sets of direct target genes that are characteristic of MYC-transformed tumour cells. Three factors account for this specificity. First, the magnitude of response parallels the change in occupancy by MYC at each promoter. Functionally distinct classes of target genes differ in the E-box sequence bound by MYC, suggesting that different cellular responses to physiological and oncogenic MYC levels are controlled by promoter affinity. Second, MYC both positively and negatively affects transcription initiation independent of its effect on transcriptional elongation(8). Third, complex formation with MIZ1 (also known as ZBTB17)(9) mediates repression of multiple target genes by MYC and the ratio of MYC and MIZ1 bound to each promoter correlates with the direction of response.","[Walz, Susanne; Lorenzin, Francesca; Wiese, Katrin E.; von Eyss, Bjoern; Herold, Steffi; Wolf, Elmar; Eilers, Martin] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Theodor Boveri Inst, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Morton, Jennifer; Karim, Saadia; Sansom, Owen] CRUK Beatson Inst, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Rycak, Lukas] Inst Mol Biol & Tumor Res IMT, D-35033 Marburg, Germany; [Dumay-Odelot, Helene; Teichmann, Martin] Univ Bordeaux, IECB, ARNA Lab, Equipe Labellisee Canc, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Bartkuhn, Marek] Univ Giessen, Inst Genet, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Roels, Frederik; Fischer, Matthias] Univ Cologne, Univ Childrens Hosp Cologne, D-50924 Cologne, Germany; [Roels, Frederik; Fischer, Matthias] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Mol Med CMMC, D-50924 Cologne, Germany; [Wuestefeld, Torsten; Zender, Lars] Univ Tubingen Hosp, Div Translat Gastrointestinal Oncol, Dept Internal Med 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Zender, Lars] German Canc Res Ctr, German Ctr Translat Canc Res DKTK, Translat Gastrointestinal Oncol Grp, D-69121 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wei, Chia-Lin] DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Wolf, Elmar] Univ Wurzburg, Rudolf Virchow Ctr, DFG Res Ctr Expt Biomed, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Eilers, Martin] Univ Wurzburg, Comprehens Canc Ctr Mainfranken, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany","Eilers, M (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Theodor Boveri Inst, Hubland, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",elmar.wolf@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de; martin.eilers@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Teichmann, Martin/M-7407-2014; DUMAY-ODELOT, Helene/M-7751-2014","Teichmann, Martin/0000-0002-5257-0510; Eilers, Martin/0000-0002-0376-6533; Wolf, Elmar/0000-0002-5299-6335; Bartkuhn, Marek/0000-0001-6872-9082; Sansom, Owen J./0000-0001-9540-3010; Morton, Jennifer/0000-0001-5766-9141","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [222/5-3, 222/12-1]; graduate college 1048 (""Molecular basis of organ development in vertebrates''); DFG Research Center for Experimental Biomedicine; Institut National Du Cancer (INCa); Ligue National Contre le Cancer (Equipe Labellisee); Cancer Research UK core grant; European Research Council investigator grant, ""Coloncan''","This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grants 222/5-3 and 222/12-1 (to M.E.), by a stipend of the graduate college 1048 (""Molecular basis of organ development in vertebrates'' to S.W.) and through the DFG Research Center for Experimental Biomedicine (to E.W.).

Recent work suggested that rather than up-and downregulating selected groups of genes(1-3), Myc targets all active promoters and enhancers in the genome (a phenomenon termed 'invasion') and acts as a general amplifier of transcription(4,5). However, the available data did not readily discriminate between direct and indirect effects of Myc on RNA biogenesis. We addressed this issue with genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA expression profiles during B-cell lymphomagenesis in mice, in cultured B cells and fibroblasts. Consistent with long-standing observations(6), we detected general increases in total RNA or messenger RNA copies per cell (hereby termed 'amplification')(4,5) when comparing actively proliferating cells with control quiescent cells: this was true whether cells were stimulated by mitogens (requiring endogenous Myc for a proliferative response)(7,8) or by deregulated, oncogenic Myc activity. RNA amplification and promoter/enhancer invasion by Myc were separable phenomena that could occur without one another. Moreover, whether or not associated with RNA amplification, Myc drove the differential expression of distinct subsets of target genes. Hence, although having the potential to interact with all active or poised regulatory elements in the genome(4,5,9-11), Myc does not directly act as a global transcriptional amplifier(4,5). Instead, our results indicate that Myc activates and represses transcription of discrete gene sets, leading to changes in cellular state that can in turn feed back on global RNA production and turnover.","[Sabo, Arianna; Kress, Theresia R.; Pelizzola, Mattia; de Pretis, Stefano; Tesi, Alessandra; Morelli, Marco J.; Bora, Pranami; Bianchi, Valerio; Ronchi, Alberto; Mueller, Heiko; Campaner, Stefano; Amati, Bruno] Fdn Ist Italiano Tecnol IIT, Ctr Genom Sci IIT SEMM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Sabo, Arianna; Kress, Theresia R.; Gorski, Marcin M.; Doni, Mirko; Verrecchia, Alessandro; Tonelli, Claudia; Faga, Giovanni; Amati, Bruno] European Inst Oncol IEO, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Low, Diana; Guccione, Ernesto] Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore","Amati, B (reprint author), Fdn Ist Italiano Tecnol IIT, Ctr Genom Sci IIT SEMM, Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",bruno.amati@iit.it,"ASTAR, IMCB/E-2320-2012","Tonelli, Claudia/0000-0002-5626-3403; Sabo, Arianna/0000-0002-9542-0045; Muller, Heiko/0000-0001-9873-3146; Pelizzola, Mattia/0000-0001-6672-9636","European School of Molecular Medicine; European Community [305626, 200720, 259743]; European Research Council; Association for International Cancer Research (AICR); Italian Health Ministry; Fondazione Cariplo; Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC)","We thank A.

Although this process is a major generator of biodiversity, its genetic basis is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the genetic architecture of niche differentiation in a sympatric species pair of threespine stickleback fish by mapping the environment-dependent effects of phenotypic traits on hybrid feeding and performance under semi-natural conditions. We show that multiple, unlinked loci act largely additively to determine position along the major niche axis separating these recently diverged species. We also find that functional mismatch between phenotypic traits reduces the growth of some stickleback hybrids beyond that expected from an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a role for epistasis between the underlying genes. This functional mismatch might lead to hybrid incompatibilities that are analogous to those underlying intrinsic reproductive isolation but depend on the ecological context.","[Arnegard, Matthew E.; Peichel, Catherine L.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Human Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Arnegard, Matthew E.; Peichel, Catherine L.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Arnegard, Matthew E.; Marchinko, Kerry B.; Conte, Gina L.; Kabir, Sahriar; Bedford, Nicole; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Arnegard, Matthew E.; Marchinko, Kerry B.; Conte, Gina L.; Kabir, Sahriar; Bedford, Nicole; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [McGee, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Matthews, Blake] EAWAG, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Bergek, Sara] Uppsala Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Chan, Yingguang Frank; Jones, Felicity C.; Kingsley, David M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chan, Yingguang Frank; Jones, Felicity C.; Kingsley, David M.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Arnegard, ME (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Human Biol Div, 1100 Fairview Ave North, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",marnegar@fhcrc.org,"; Matthews, Blake/B-5608-2009","Jones, Felicity/0000-0002-5027-1031; Matthews, Blake/0000-0001-9089-704X","US National Institutes of Health [F32GM086125, R01 GM089733, P50 HG002568]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation","We thank J.

However, directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells yields haematopoietic cells that engraft poorly. Here, we have devised a method to phenocopy the vascular-niche microenvironment of haemogenic cells, thereby enabling reprogramming of human endothelial cells into engraftable haematopoietic cells without transition through a pluripotent intermediate. Highly purifiednon-haemogenic human umbilical vein endothelial cells or adult dermalmicrovascular endothelial cells were transduced with the transcription factors FOSB, GFI1, RUNX1 and SPI1 (hereafter referred to as FGRS), and then propagated on serum-free instructive vascular niche monolayers to induce outgrowth of haematopoietic colonies containing cells with functional and immunophenotypic features of multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs). These endothelial cells that have been reprogrammed into human MPPs (rEC-hMPPs) acquire colony-forming-cell potential and durably engraft into immune-deficient mice after primary and secondary transplantation, producing long-term rEC-hMPP-derived myeloid (granulocytic/monocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic) and lymphoid (natural killer and B cell) progenies. Conditional expression of FGRS transgenes, combined with vascular induction, activates endogenous FGRS genes, endowing rEC-hMPPs with a transcriptional and functional profile similar to that of self-renewing MPPs. Our approach underscores the role of inductive cues from the vascular niche in coordinating and sustaining haematopoietic specification and may prove useful for engineering autologous haematopoietic grafts to treat inherited and acquired blood disorders.","[Sandler, Vladislav M.; Lis, Raphael; Liu, Ying; Kedem, Alon; James, Daylon; Butler, Jason M.; Rafii, Shahin] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ansary Stem Cell Inst, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Sandler, Vladislav M.; Lis, Raphael; Liu, Ying; Kedem, Alon; James, Daylon; Butler, Jason M.; Rafii, Shahin] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lis, Raphael; Kedem, Alon; James, Daylon] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ronald O Perelman & Claudia Cohen Ctr Reprod Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Elemento, Olivier] Weill Cornell Med Coll, HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsau, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Scandura, Joseph M.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Scandura, Joseph M.] New York Presbyterian Hosp, New York, NY 10065 USA","Rafii, S (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Ansary Stem Cell Inst, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA.",srafii@med.cornell.edu,,"Rafii, Shahin/0000-0001-5605-1067; Scandura, Joseph/0000-0002-9525-143X","Empire State Stem Cell Board (ESSCB); New York State Department of Health [NYSDH C026878]; Ansary Stem Cell Institute (ASCI); HHMI; ESSCB/NYSDH [C024180, C026438, C026878, C028117]; NHLBI [R01HL097797, R01HL119872, U01 HL099997, HL119872, HL055748, U01-HL099997]; NIDDK [R01DK095039]; NCI [U54CA163167, CA159175, CA163167]; Qatar National Priorities Research Foundation [NPRP08-663-3-140]; Qatar Foundation BioMedical Research Program; Starr Foundation and a Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Scholar award; American Society of Hematology Scholar Award; Angiocrine Bioscience; ASCI","V.M.S. is supported by Empire State Stem Cell Board (ESSCB) and New York State Department of Health (NYSDH C026878).

We constructed a glycoprotein expression signature, which revealed that metastatic tumours upregulate expression of bulky glycoproteins. A computational model predicted that these glycoproteins would influence transmembrane receptor spatial organization and function. We tested this prediction by investigating whether bulky glycoproteins in the glycocalyx promote a tumour phenotype in human cells by increasing integrin adhesion and signalling. Our data revealed that a bulky glycocalyx facilitates integrin clustering by funnelling active integrins into adhesions and altering integrin state by applying tension to matrix-bound integrins, independent of actomyosin contractility. Expression of large tumour-associated glycoproteins in non-transformed mammary cells promoted focal adhesion assembly and facilitated integrin dependent growth factor signalling to support cell growth and survival. Clinical studies revealed that large glycoproteins are abundantly expressed on circulating tumour cells from patients with advanced disease. Thus, a bulky glycocalyx is a feature of tumour cells that could foster metastasis by mechanically enhancing cell-surface receptor function.","[Paszek, Matthew J.; DuFort, Christopher C.; Bainer, Russell; Mouw, Janna K.; Lakins, Jonathon N.; Wijekoon, Amanda C.; Cassereau, Luke; Rubashkin, Matthew G.; Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.; DuFort, Christopher C.; Bainer, Russell; Mouw, Janna K.; Lakins, Jonathon N.; Wijekoon, Amanda C.; Cassereau, Luke; Rubashkin, Matthew G.; Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Bioengn & Tissue Regenerat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.; DuFort, Christopher C.; Bainer, Russell; Wijekoon, Amanda C.; Cassereau, Luke; Rubashkin, Matthew G.; Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Bay Area Phys Sci Oncol Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.] Cornell Univ, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Kavli Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Rossier, Olivier; Giannone, Gregory] Univ Bordeaux, UMR 5297, Interdisciplinary Inst Neurosci, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Rossier, Olivier; Giannone, Gregory] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Interdisciplinary Inst Neurosci, UMR 5297, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Godula, Kamil; Hudak, Jason E.; Bertozzi, Carolyn R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Godula, Kamil] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Magbanua, Mark J.; Rugo, Hope S.; Park, John W.; Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Magbanua, Mark J.; Rugo, Hope S.; Park, John W.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Thorn, Kurt S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Davidson, Michael W.] Florida State Univ, Natl High Magnet Field Lab, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Davidson, Michael W.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Hammer, Daniel A.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hammer, Daniel A.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bertozzi, Carolyn R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bertozzi, Carolyn R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Weaver, Valerie M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Weaver, VM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Valerie.Weaver@ucsfmedctr.org,"Foundry, Molecular/G-9968-2014; Rossier, Olivier/I-6569-2013","Rossier, Olivier/0000-0002-6932-931X; Thorn, Kurt/0000-0001-9310-288X","Kavli Institute; UCSF Program for Biomedical Breakthrough postdoctoral fellowships; DoD NDSEG Fellowship; NIH Pathway to Independence Award [K99 EB013446-02]; French Ministry of Research; CNRS; ANR grant Nanomotility; INSERM; Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer; Conseil Regional Aquitaine; NIH [AI082292-03A1, 2R01GM059907-13, GM59907]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; BCRP DOD Era of Hope Scholar Expansion grant [BC122990]; NIH NCI [U54CA163155-01, U54CA143836-01, 1U01 E5019458-01, CA138818-01A1]; France BioImaging [ANR-10-INBS-04-01]","We thank S.

The majority of the refractory elements are produced in supernova explosions, but it is unclear how and where dust grains condense and grow, and how they avoid destruction in the harsh environments of star-forming galaxies. The recent detection of 0.1 to 0.5 solar masses of dust in nearby supernova remnants(5-7) suggests in situ dust formation, while other observations reveal very little dust in supernovae in the first few years after explosion(1,8,10). Observations of the spectral evolution of the bright SN 2010j1 have been interpreted as pre-existing dust(11), dust formationlz(12,13) or no dust at all(14). Here we report the rapid (40 to 240 days) formation of dust in its dense circumstellar medium. The wavelength-dependent extinction of this dust reveals the presence of very large (exceeding one micrometre) grains, which resist destruction(15). At later times (500 to 900 days), the near-infrared thermal emission shows an accelerated growth in dust mass, marking the transition of the dust source from the circumstellar medium to the ejecta. This provides the link between the early and late dust mass evolution in supernovae with dense circumstellar media.","[Gall, Christa] Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Gall, Christa; Hjorth, Jens; Watson, Darach; Maund, Justyn R.; Leloudas, Giorgos; Malesani, Daniele] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Gall, Christa; Dwek, Eli] NASA, Observat Cosmol Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Maund, Justyn R.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Math & Phys, Astrophys Res Ctr, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Fox, Ori] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Leloudas, Giorgos] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys, Oskar Klein Ctr, Albanova Univ Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Day-Jones, Avril C.] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile","Gall, C (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ny Munkegade 120, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",cgall@phys.au.dk,"Hjorth, Jens/M-5787-2014; Watson, Darach/E-4521-2015; Gall, Christa/P-7630-2016","Hjorth, Jens/0000-0002-4571-2306; Watson, Darach/0000-0002-4465-8264; Gall, Christa/0000-0002-8526-3963; Maund, Justyn/0000-0003-0733-7215; Leloudas, Giorgos/0000-0002-8597-0756","ESO Telescopes at the La Silla paranal Observatory [084.C-0315(D), 087.C-0456(A)]; NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP); Danish Agency for Science and Technology and Innovation; Swedish Research Council [623-2011-7117]; Proyecto Basal [PB06]; Joint Committee ESO-Government Chile; Danish National Research Foundation","We thank L.

The theoretical description of such electron-degenerate matter has matured since the early quantum statistical model of Thomas and Fermi(4-10), and now suggests that new complexities can emerge at pressures where core electrons (not only valence electrons) influence the structure and bonding of matter(11). Recent developments in shock-free dynamic (ramp) compression now allow laboratory access to this dense matter regime. Here we describe ramp-compression measurements for diamond, achieving 3.7-fold compression at a peak pressure of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres). These equation-of-state data can now be compared to first-principles density functional calculations(12) and theories long used to describe matter present in the interiors of giant planets, in stars, and in inertial-confinement fusion experiments. Our data also provide new constraints on mass-radius relationships for carbon-rich planets.","[Smith, R. F.; Eggert, J. H.; Braun, D. G.; Patterson, J. R.; Rudd, R. E.; Biener, J.; Lazicki, A.

With laboratory efficiencies approaching 20 per cent(1), the research and development targets for CdTe are to reduce the cost of power generation further to less than half a US dollar per watt (ref. 2) and to minimize the environmental impact. A central part of the manufacturing process involves doping the polycrystalline thin-film CdTe with CdCl2. This acts to form the photovoltaic junction at the CdTe/CdS interface(3,4) and to passivate the grain boundaries(5), making it essential in achieving high device efficiencies. However, although such doping has been almost ubiquitous since the development of this processing route over 25 years ago(6), CdCl2 has two severe disadvantages; it is both expensive (about 30 cents per gram) and a water-soluble source of toxic cadmium ions, presenting a risk to both operators and the environment during manufacture. Here we demonstrate that solar cells prepared using MgCl2, which is non-toxic and costs less than a cent per gram, have efficiencies (around 13%) identical to those of a CdCl2-processed control group. They have similar hole densities in the active layer (9x10(14)cm(-3)) and comparable impurity profiles for Cl and O, these elements being important p-type dopants for CdTe thin films. Contrary to expectation, CdCl2-processed and MgCl2-processed solar cells contain similar concentrations of Mg; this is because ofMgout-diffusion from the soda-lime glass substrates and is not disadvantageous to device performance. However, treatment with other low-cost chlorides such as NaCl, KCl and MnCl2 leads to the introduction of electrically active impurities that do compromise device performance. Our results demonstrate that CdCl2 may simply be replaced directly with MgCl2 in the existing fabrication process, thus both minimizing the environmental risk and reducing the cost of CdTe solar-cell production.","[Major, J.

Melting of this material can occur in one of two ways. The flow induced in the mantle by the slab can result in upwelling and melting through adiabatic decompression(1,3). Alternatively, fluids released from the descending slab through dehydration reactions can migrate into the hot mantle wedge, inducing melting by lowering the solidus temperature(2,4). The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive(1). In either case, the buoyant melts make their way towards the surface to reside in the crust or to be extruded as lava. Here we use magnetotelluric data collected across the central state of Washington, USA, to image the complete pathway for the fluid-melt phase. By incorporating constraints from a collocated seismic study(5) into the magnetotelluric inversion process, we obtain superior constraints on the fluids and melt in a subduction setting. Specifically, we are able to identify and connect fluid release at or near the top of the slab, migration of fluids into the overlying mantle wedge, melting in the wedge, and transport of the melt/fluid phase to a reservoir in the crust beneath Mt Rainier.","[McGary, R.

Invertebrates constitute a substantial part of the diet of many bird species during the breeding season and are indispensable for raising offspring(7). We investigated the hypothesis that the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has a negative impact on insectivorous bird populations. Here we show that, in the Netherlands, local population trends were significantly more negative in areas with higher surface-water concentrations of imidacloprid. At imidacloprid concentrations of more than 20 nanograms per litre, bird populations tended to decline by 3.5 per cent on average annually. Additional analyses revealed that this spatial pattern of decline appeared only after the introduction of imidacloprid to the Netherlands, in the mid-1990s. We further show that the recent negative relationship remains after correcting for spatial differences in land-use changes that are known to affect bird populations in farmland. Our results suggest that the impact of neonicotinoids on the natural environment is even more substantial than has recently been reported and is reminiscent of the effects of persistent insecticides in the past. Future legislation should take into account the potential cascading effects of neonicotinoidson ecosystems.","[Hallmann, Caspar A.; de Kroon, Hans; Jongejans, Eelke] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Expt Plant Ecol, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hallmann, Caspar A.; de Kroon, Hans; Jongejans, Eelke] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hallmann, Caspar A.; Foppen, Ruud P.

The extensive genetic heterogeneity of this disorder requires a genome-wide detection of all types of genetic variation. Microarray studies and, more recently, exome sequencing have demonstrated the importance of de novo copy number variations (CNVs) and single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in ID, but the majority of cases remain undiagnosed(3-6). Here we applied whole-genome sequencing to 50 patients with severe ID and their unaffected parents. All patients included had not received a molecular diagnosis after extensive genetic prescreening, including microarray-based CNV studies and exome sequencing. Notwithstanding this prescreening, 84 de novo SNVs affecting the coding region were identified, which showed a statistically significant enrichment of loss-of-function mutations as well as an enrichment for genes previously implicated in ID-related disorders. In addition, we identified eight de novo CNVs, including single-exon and intra-exonic deletions, as well as interchromosomal duplications. These CNVs affected known ID genes more frequently than expected. On the basis of diagnostic interpretation of all de novo variants, a conclusive genetic diagnosis was reached in 20 patients. Together with one compound heterozygous CNV causing disease in a recessive mode, this results in a diagnostic yield of 42% in this extensively studied cohort, and 62% as a cumulative estimate in an unselected cohort. These results suggest that de novo SNVs and CNVs affecting the coding region are a major cause of severe ID. Genome sequencing can be applied as a single genetic test to reliably identify and characterize the comprehensive spectrum of genetic variation, providing a genetic diagnosis in the majority of patients with severe ID.","[Gilissen, Christian; Hehir-Kwa, Jayne Y.; Thung, Djie Tjwan; van de Vorst, Maartje; van Bon, Bregje W.

We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning(3-8). Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock.

Transplantation is often the only therapeutic option available to patients with LSC deficiency. However, while transplant success depends foremost on LSC frequency within grafts(5), a gene allowing for prospective LSC enrichment has not been identified so far(5). Here we show that ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member(5) (ABCB5)(6,7) marks LSCs and is required for LSC maintenance, corneal development and repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prospectively isolated humanor murine ABCB5-positive LSCs possess the exclusive capacity to fully restore the cornea upon grafting to LSC-deficient mice in xenogeneic or syngeneic transplantation models. ABCB5 is preferentially expressed on label-retaining LSCs2 in mice and p63 alpha-positive LSCs8 in humans. Consistent with these findings, ABCB5-positive LSC frequency is reduced in LSC-deficient patients. Abcb5 loss of function in Abcb5 knockout mice causes depletion of quiescent LSCs due to enhanced proliferation and apoptosis, and results in defective corneal differentiation and wound healing. Our results from gene knockout studies, LSC tracing and transplantation models, as well as phenotypic and functional analyses of human biopsy specimens, provide converging lines of evidence that ABCB5 identifies mammalian LSCs.

Cornea epithelial cells (CECs) undergo continuous renewal from limbal stem or progenitor cells (LSCs)(1,2), and deficiency in LSCs or corneal epithelium-which turns cornea into a non-transparent, keratinized skin-like epithelium-causes corneal surface disease that leads to blindness in millions of people worldwide(3). How LSCs are maintained and differentiated into corneal epithelium in healthy individuals and which key molecular events are defective in patients have been largely unknown. Here we report establishment of an in vitro feeder-cell-free LSC expansion and three-dimensional corneal differentiation protocol in which we found that the transcription factors p63 (tumour protein 63) and PAX6 (paired box protein PAX6) act together to specify LSCs, and WNT7A controls corneal epithelium differentiation through PAX6. Loss of WNT7A or PAX6 induces LSCs into skin-like epithelium, a critical defect tightly linked to common human corneal diseases. Notably, transduction of PAX6 in skin epithelial stem cells is sufficient to convert them to LSC-like cells, and upon transplantation onto eyes in a rabbit corneal injury model, these reprogrammed cells are able to replenish CECs and repair damaged corneal surface. These findings suggest a central role of the WNT7A-PAX6 axis in corneal epithelial cell fate determination, and point to a new strategy for treating corneal surface diseases.","[Ouyang, Hong; Lin, Ying; Xi, Lei; Liu, Yizhi; Zhang, Kang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Ophthalm Ctr, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Guangzhou 510060, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Hong; Lin, Ying; Zhang, Xiaohui; Xi, Lei; Patel, Sherrina; Luo, Jing; Yang, Yang; Yeh, Emily; Lin, Jonathan; Pei, Michelle; Zhu, Jin; Zhang, Liangfang; Chen, Shaochen; Fu, Xiang-Dong; Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Ophthalmol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ouyang, Hong; Lin, Ying; Zhang, Xiaohui; Xi, Lei; Patel, Sherrina; Luo, Jing; Yang, Yang; Yeh, Emily; Lin, Jonathan; Pei, Michelle; Zhu, Jin; Zhang, Liangfang; Chen, Shaochen; Fu, Xiang-Dong; Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Biomat & Tissue Engn Ctr, Inst Engn Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Xue, Yuanchao; Li, Hairi; Fu, Xiang-Dong] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cai, Huimin; Zhang, Meixia; Zhang, Ming; Li, Gen; Jiang, Wei; Cao, Guiqun; Zhang, Kang] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, State Key Lab Biotherapy, Mol Med Res Ctr, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Cai, Huimin] Guangzhou KangRui Biol Pharmaceut Technol Co Ltd, Guangzhou 510005, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liangfang; Chen, Shaochen] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Nanoengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yu, Benjamin] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yu, Benjamin; Fu, Xiang-Dong; Zhang, Kang] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhang, Kang] Vet Adm Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA 92093 USA","Zhang, K (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Ophthalm Ctr, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Guangzhou 510060, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xdfu@ucsd.edu; yzliu62@yahoo.com; kangzhang@ucsd.edu,,"Yu, Benjamin/0000-0001-6663-6616","973 program [2013CB967504, 2014CB964900]; Project of Fundamental Research Funds [2012KF03]; State Key laboratory of Ophthalmology; NIH [GM049369]; KACST-UCSD Center of Excellence in Nanomedicine; NIH Director's Transformative R01 Program [R01 EY021374]; CIRM","This study is supported in part by the 973 program (2013CB967504 and 2014CB964900), Project of Fundamental Research Funds (no.2012KF03), State Key laboratory of Ophthalmology, NIH (GM049369), KACST-UCSD Center of Excellence in Nanomedicine, NIH Director's Transformative R01 Program (R01 EY021374) and CIRM.",,22,49,52,4,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jul,2014,511,7509,,,,,358,+,,10.1038/nature13465,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AL2YR,WOS:000338992200038,25030175,No,,,11/20/17

It is not only proteins involved in DNA replication or the DNA damage response (DDR) that are important for maintaining genome integrity: from yeast to higher eukaryotes, mutations in genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonudeoprotein (mRNP) also induce DNA damage and genome instability. This instability is frequently mediated by R-loops formed by DNA-RNA hybrids and a displaced single-stranded DNA(1). Here we show that the human TREX-2 complex, which is involved in mRNP biogenesis and export, prevents genome instability as determined by the accumulation of gamma-H2AX (Ser-139 phosphorylated histone H2AX) and 53BP1 foci and single-cell electrophoresis in cells depleted of the TREX-2 subunits PCID2, GANP and DSSI. We show that the BRCA2 repair factor, which binds to DSS1, also associates with PCID2 in the cell. The use of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hybrid-binding domain of RNase HI and the S9.6 antibody did not detect R-loops in TREX-2-depleted cells, but did detect the accumulation of R-loops in BRCA2-depleted cells. The results indicate that R-loops are frequently formed in cells and that BRCA2 is required for their processing. This link between BRCA2 and RNA-mediated genome instability indicates that R-loops may be a chief source of replication stress and cancer-associated instability.","[Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain","Aguilera, A (reprint author), Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Ave Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",aguilo@us.es,"Barroso, Sonia/F-2288-2016; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia/F-3314-2016; Garcia-Rubio, Maria/C-2061-2017; Tumini, Emanuela/C-2163-2017","Barroso, Sonia/0000-0002-0062-2016; Garcia-Rubio, Maria/0000-0003-0981-0555; Tumini, Emanuela/0000-0001-9412-9355; Herrera Moyano, Emilia/0000-0003-3948-3874; bhatia, vaibhav/0000-0003-4553-7824; Aguilera, Andres/0000-0003-4782-1714","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [C5D2007-00015, BFU2010-16372]; Junta de Andalucia [CVI4567]; European Union (FEDER)","We thank J.C.

In some cases a single discrete RNA sequence performs multiple roles, and this can be conferred by a complex three-dimensional structure. Such multifunctionality can also be driven or enhanced by the ability of a given RNA to assume different conformational (and therefore functional) states'. Despite its biological importance, a detailed structural understanding of the paradigm of RNA structure-driven multifunctionality is lacking. To address this gap it is useful to study examples from single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, a prototype being the tRNA-like structure (TLS) found at the 3' end of the turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). This TLS not only acts like a tRNA to drive aminoacylation of the viral genomic (g)RNA(2-4), but also interacts with other structures in the 3' untranslated region of the gRNA(5), contains the promoter for negative-strand synthesis, and influences several infection-critical processes'. TLS RNA can provide a glimpse into the structural basis of RNA multifunctionality and plasticity, but for decades its high-resolution structure has remained elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of the complete TYMV TLS to 2.0 angstrom resolution. Globally, the RNA adopts a shape that mimics tRNA, but it uses a very different set of intramolecular interactions to achieve this shape. These interactions also allow the TLS to readily switch conformations. In addition, the TLS structure is 'two faced': one face closely mimics tRNA and drives aminoacylation, the other face diverges from tRNA and enables additional functionality. The TLS is thus structured to perform several functions and interact with diverse binding partners, and we demonstrate its ability to specifically bind to ribosomes.","[Colussi, Timothy M.; Costantino, David A.; Hammond, John A.; Ruehle, Grant M.; Kieft, Jeffrey S.] Univ Colorado, Denver Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Colussi, Timothy M.; Costantino, David A.; Kieft, Jeffrey S.] Univ Colorado, Denver Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Nix, Jay C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Biol Consortium, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Kieft, JS (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Denver Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",jeffrey.kieft@ucdenver.edu,,,"UC Cancer Center [P30CA046934]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-ACO2-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health [GM081346, GM097333]","We thank H.

Although embryonic stemcells (ES cells) from in vitro fertilized embryos (IVFES cells) represent the 'gold standard', they are allogeneic to patients. Autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are prone to epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations. To determine whether such abnormalities are intrinsic to somatic cell reprogramming or secondary to the reprogramming method, genetically matched sets of human IVF ES cells, iPS cells and nuclear transfer ES cells (NT ES cells) derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) were subjected to genome-wide analyses. Both NT ES cells and iPS cells derived from the same somatic cells contained comparable numbers of de novo copy number variations. In contrast, DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of NT ES cells corresponded closely to those of IVF ES cells, whereas iPS cells differed and retained residual DNA methylation patterns typical of parental somatic cells. Thus, human somatic cells can be faithfully reprogrammed to pluripotency by SCNT and are therefore ideal for cell replacement therapies.","[Ma, Hong; Daughtry, Brittany; Kang, Eunju; Tippner-Hedges, Rebecca; Ahmed, Riffat; Gutierrez, Nuria Marti; Van Dyken, Crystal; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Ctr Embryon Cell & Gene Therapy, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Ma, Hong; Daughtry, Brittany; Tachibana, Masahito; Kang, Eunju; Tippner-Hedges, Rebecca; Ahmed, Riffat; Gutierrez, Nuria Marti; Van Dyken, Crystal; Polat, Alim; Sugawara, Atsushi; Sparman, Michelle; Wolf, Don P.; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Reprod & Dev Sci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Morey, Robert; Sabatini, Karen; Thiagarajan, Rathi D.; Laurent, Louise C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Reprod Med, Sanford Consortium Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [O'Neil, Ryan C.; He, Yupeng; Schultz, Matthew D.; Hariharan, Manoj; Nery, Joseph R.; Castanon, Rosa; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [O'Neil, Ryan C.; He, Yupeng] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gokhale, Sumita] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Roger Williams Med Ctr, Univ Pathologists LLC, Providence, RI 02918 USA; [Amato, Paula; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Div Reprod Endocrinol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Mitalipov, S (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Ctr Embryon Cell & Gene Therapy, 3303 Southwest Bond Ave, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",ecker@salk.edu; llaurent@ucsd.edu; mitalipo@ohsu.edu,"Ecker, Joseph/B-9144-2008; Hariharan, Manoj/N-2855-2015","Ecker, Joseph/0000-0001-5799-5895; Hariharan, Manoj/0000-0002-1006-5372",Leducq Foundation; OHSU; UCSD Department of Reproductive Medicine; Salk International Council Chair fund endowment; Mary K.

Analysis of disease tolerance pathways could provide new approaches for treating infections and other inflammatory diseases. Typically, an initial exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a state of refractoriness to further LPS challenge (endotoxin tolerance). We found that a first exposure of mice to LPS activated the ligand-operated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which provided an activating ligand to the former, to down-regulate early inflammatory gene expression.

Despite the importance of the NMDA receptor in the development and function of the brain, a molecular structure of an intact receptor has remained elusive. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of the Xenopus laevis GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor with the allosteric inhibitor, Ro25-6981, partial agonists and the ion channel blocker, MK-801. Receptor subunits are arranged in a 1-2-1-2 fashion, demonstrating extensive interactions between the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. The transmembrane domains harbour a closed-blocked ion channel, a pyramidal central vestibule lined by residues implicated in binding ion channel blockers and magnesium, and a twofold symmetric arrangement of ion channel pore loops.

Quantum dynamics can be described by particle-like carriers of information that emerge in the collective behaviour of the underlying system, the so-called quasiparticles(1). These elementary excitations are predicted to distribute quantum information in a fashion determined by the system's interactions(2). Here we report quasiparticle dynamics observed in a quantum many-body system of trapped atomic ions(3,4). First, we observe the entanglement distributed by quasiparticles as they trace out light-cone-like wavefronts(5-11). Second, using the ability to tune the interaction range in our system, we observe information propagation in an experimental regime where the effective-light-cone picture does not apply(7,12). Our results will enable experimental studies of a range of quantum phenomena, including transport(13,14), thermalization(15), localization(16) and entanglement growth(17), and represent a first step towards a newquantum-optic regime of engineered quasiparticles with tunable nonlinear interactions.","[Jurcevic, P.; Lanyon, B.

Phase-change materials switch between two solid states-amorphous and crystalline-in response to a stimulus, such as heat, with an associated change in the physical properties of the material, including optical absorption, electrical conductance and Young's modulus(1-5). The initial applications of these materials(particularly the germanium antimony tellurium alloy Ge2Sb2Te5) exploited the reversible change in their optical properties in rewritable optical data storage technologies(6,7). More recently, the change in their electrical conductivity has also been extensively studied in the development of non-volatile phase-changememories(4,5). Here we show that by combining the optical and electronic property modulation of such materials, display and data visualization applications that go beyond data storage can be created. Using extremely thin phase-change materials and transparent conductors, we demonstrate electrically induced stable colour changes in both reflective and semi-transparent modes. Further, we show how a pixelated approach can be used in displays on both rigid and flexible films. This optoelectronic framework using low-dimensional phase-change materials has many likely applications, such as ultrafast, entirely solid-state displays with nanometre-scale pixels, semi-transparent 'smart' glasses, 'smart' contact lenses and artificial retina devices.","[Hosseini, Peiman; Bhaskaran, Harish] Univ Oxford, Dept Mat, Oxford OX1 3PH, England; [Wright, C.

The relative importance of different sources of iron to the oceans is not well known, however, and flux estimates from atmospheric dust, hydrothermal vents and oceanic sediments vary by orders of magnitude. Here we present a high-resolution transect of dissolved stable iron isotope ratios (delta Fe-56) and iron concentrations ([Fe]) along a section of the North Atlantic Ocean. The different iron sources can be identified by their unique delta Fe-56 signatures, which persist throughout the water column. This allows us to calculate the relative contribution from dust, hydrothermal venting and reductive and non-reductive sedimentary release to the dissolved phase. We find that Saharan dust aerosol is the dominant source of dissolved iron along the section, contributing 71-87 per cent of dissolved iron. Additional sources of iron are non-reductive release from oxygenated sediments on the North American margin (10-19 per cent), reductive sedimentary dissolution on the African margin (1-4 per cent) and hydrothermal venting at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (2-6 per cent). Our data also indicate that hydrothermal vents in the North Atlantic are a source of isotopically light iron, which travels thousands of kilometres from vent sites, potentially influencing surface productivity. Changes in the relative importance of the different iron sources through time may affect interactions between the carbon cycle and climate.","[Conway, Tim M.; John, Seth G.] Univ S Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Conway, TM (reprint author), ETH, Inst Geochem & Petrol, NWD81-4,Clausiusstr 25, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",conway.tm@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [OCE-1131387],"We thank the Captain, crew and GEOTRACES sampling team on RV Knorr on both USGT10 and USGT11; A.

Even though they are localized hotspots in the landscape, UHIs have a profound impact on the lives of urban residents, who comprise more than half of the world's population(3). A barrier to UHI mitigation is the lack of quantitative attribution of the various contributions to UHI intensity(4) (expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas, Delta T). A common perception is that reduction in evaporative cooling in urban land is the dominant driver of DT (ref. 5). Here we use a climate model to show that, for cities across North America, geographic variations in daytime Delta T are largely explained by variations in the efficiency with which urban and rural areas convect heat to the lower atmosphere. If urban areas are aerodynamically smoother than surrounding rural areas, urban heat dissipation is relatively less efficient and urban warming occurs (and vice versa). This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing daytime Delta T by 3.06 +/- 0.3 kelvin (mean and standard error) in humid climates but decreasing Delta T by 1.5 +/- 0.2 kelvin in dry climates. In the humid eastern United States, there is evidence of higher Delta T in drier years. These relationship simply that UHIs will exacerbate heat wave stress on human health in wet climates where high temperature effects are already compounded by high air humidity(6,7) and in drier years when positive temperature anomalies may be reinforced by a precipitation temperature feedback(8). Our results support albedo management as a viable means of reducing Delta T on large scales(9,10).","[Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Smith, Ronald B.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Oleson, Keith] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Lee, X (reprint author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xuhui.lee@yale.edu,"Oleson, Keith/A-9328-2008",,Ministry of Education of China (grant PCSIRT); Yale Climate and Energy Institute; Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies; Yale University Graduate Fellowship; NASA [NNX10AK79G]; NCARWCIASP; US National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by the Ministry of Education of China (grant PCSIRT), the Yale Climate and Energy Institute, the Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies, and a Yale University Graduate Fellowship.

Unlike in other public goods games(6-9), however, future generations cannot reciprocate actions made today. What mechanisms can maintain cooperation with the future? To answer this question, we devise a new experimental paradigm, the 'Intergenerational Goods Game'. A line-up of successive groups (generations) can each either extract a resource to exhaustion or leave something for the next group. Exhausting the resource maximizes the payoff for the present generation, but leaves all future generations empty-handed. Here we show that the resource is almost always destroyed if extraction decisions are made individually. This failure to cooperate with the future is driven primarily by a minority of individuals who extract far more than what is sustainable. In contrast, when extractions are democratically decided by vote, the resource is consistently sustained. Voting(10-15) is effective for two reasons. First, it allows a majority of cooperators to restrain defectors. Second, it reassures conditional cooperators(16) that their efforts are not futile. Voting, however, only promotes sustainability if it is binding for all involved.

Currently, there is little evidence that wild animals can acquire resistance to these pathogens(5). Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a pathogenic fungus implicated in the recent global decline of amphibians(6). Here we demonstrate that three species of amphibians can acquire behavioural or immunological resistance to B. dendrobatidis. Frogs learned to avoid the fungus after just one B. dendrobatidis exposure and temperature-induced clearance. In subsequent experiments in which B. dendrobatidis avoidance was prevented, the number of previous exposures was a negative predictor of B. dendrobatidis burden on frogs and B. dendrobatidis-induced mortality, and was a positive predictor of lymphocyte abundance and proliferation. These results suggest that amphibians can acquire immunity to B. dendrobatidis that overcomes pathogen-induced immunosuppression(7-9) and increases their survival. Importantly, exposure to dead fungus induced a similar magnitude of acquired resistance as exposure to live fungus. Exposure of frogs to B. dendrobatidis antigens might offer a practical way to protect pathogen-naive amphibians and facilitate the reintroduction of amphibians to locations in the wild where B. dendrobatidis persists. Moreover, given the conserved nature of vertebrate immune responses to fungi(5) and the fact that many animals are capable of learning to avoid natural enemies(10), these results offer hope that other wild animal taxa threatened by invasive fungi might be rescued by management approaches based on herd immunity.","[McMahon, Taegan A.; Sears, Brittany F.; Bessler, Scott M.; Brown, Jenise M.; Deutsch, Kaitlin; Halstead, Neal T.; Lentz, Garrett; Tenouri, Nadia; Young, Suzanne; Civitello, David J.; Ortega, Nicole; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [McMahon, Taegan A.] Univ Tampa, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33606 USA; [Venesky, Matthew D.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Fites, J.

The low sensitivity of the standard diagnostic test leads to considerable ambiguity in determining the main transmission routes of infection, which exacerbates the continuing scientific debate(2-6). In turn this uncertainty fuels the fierce public and political disputes on the necessity of controlling badgers to limit the spread of infection. Here we present a dynamic stochastic spatial model for bovine TB in Great Britain that combines within-farm and between-farm transmission. At the farmscale the model incorporates stochastic transmission of infection, maintenance of infection in the environment and a testing protocol that mimics historical government policy. Between-farm transmission has a short-range environmental component and is explicitly driven by movements of individual cattle between farms, as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System(2). The resultant model replicates the observed annual increase of infection over time as well as the spread of infection into new areas. Given that our model is mechanistic, it can ascribe transmission pathways to each new case; the majority of newly detected cases involve several transmission routes with moving infected cattle, reinfection from an environmental reservoir and poor sensitivity of the diagnostic test all having substantive roles. This underpins our findings on the implications of control measures. Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective.","[Brooks-Pollock, Ellen] Univ Cambridge, Dept Vet Med, Dis Dynam Unit, Cambridge CB3 0ES, England; [Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Keeling, Matt J.] Univ Warwick, Math Inst, WIDER Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Keeling, Matt J.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Roberts, Gareth O.] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Keeling, MJ (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Math Inst, WIDER Ctr, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",M.J.Keeling@warwick.ac.uk,"Keeling, Matt/J-9280-2012","Keeling, Matt/0000-0003-4639-4765",BBSRC; Wellcome Trust; EPSRC,"This work was funded by BBSRC, the Wellcome Trust and EPSRC.

Inplants, it has also contributed greatly to crop domestication, as the superior properties of many modern crop plants were conferred by ancient allopolyploidization events(5,6). It is generally thought that allopolyploidization occurred through hybridization events between species, accompanied or followed by genome duplication(6,7). Although many allopolyploids arose from closely related species (congeners), there are also allopolyploid species that were formed from more distantly related progenitor species belonging to different genera or even different tribes(8). Here we have examined the possibility that allopolyploidization can also occur by asexual mechanisms. We show that upon grafting-a mechanism of plant-plant interaction that is widespread in nature-entire nuclear genomes can be transferred between plant cells. We provide direct evidence for this process resulting in speciation by creating a new allopolyploid plant species from a herbaceous species and a woody species in the nightshade family. The new species is fertile and produces fertile progeny. Our data highlight natural grafting as a potential asexual mechanism of speciation and also provide a method for the generation of novel allopolyploid crop species.","[Fuentes, Ignacia; Stegemann, Sandra; Karcher, Daniel; Bock, Ralph] Max Planck Inst Mol Pflanzenphysiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Golczyk, Hieronim] John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Inst Biotechnol, Dept Mol Biol, PL-20708 Lublin, Poland","Bock, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Pflanzenphysiol, Muhlenberg 1, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",rbock@mpimp-golm.mpg.de,"Fuentes, Ignacia/G-4785-2016",,Max Planck Society,"We thank the MPI-MP Green Team for help with plant transformation, K.

For instance, Neurexin 1a and 2 (NRXN1 and NRXN2) and CNTNAP2 (also known as CASPR2), all members of the neurexin superfamily of transmembrane molecules, have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, their loss leads to deficits that have been best characterized with regard to their effect on excitatory cells(1,2). Notably, other disease-associated genes such as BDNF and ERBB4 implicate specific interneuron synapses in psychiatric disorders(3,4). Consistent with this, cortical interneuron dysfunction has been linked to epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism(5,6). Using a microarray screen that focused upon synapse-associated molecules, we identified Cntnap4 (contactin associated protein-like 4, also known as Caspr4) as highly enriched in developing murine interneurons. In this study we show that Cntnap4 is localized presynaptically and its loss leads to a reduction in the output of cortical parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid producing) basket cells. Paradoxically, the loss of Cntnap4 augments midbrain dopaminergic release in the nucleus accumbens. In Cntnap4 mutant mice, synaptic defects in these disease-relevant neuronal populations are mirrored by sensory-motor gating and grooming endophenotypes; these symptoms could be pharmacologically reversed, providing promise for therapeutic intervention in psychiatric disorders.","[Karayannis, T.; Au, E.; Kruglikov, I.; Restituito, S.; Roy, N.

IGCTs show great variation in their geographical and gender distribution, histological composition and treatment outcomes. The incidence of IGCTs is historically five- to eightfold greater in Japan and other East Asian countries than in Western countries(1), with peak incidence near the time of puberty(2). About half of the tumours are located in the pineal region. The male to-female incidence ratio is approximately 3-4:1 overall, but is even higher for tumours located in the pineal region(3). Owing to the scarcity of tumour specimens available for research, little is currently known about this rare disease. Here we report the analysis of 62 cases by next-generation sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array and expression array. We find the KIT/RAS signalling pathway frequently mutated in more than 50% of IGCTs, including novel recurrent somatic mutations in KIT, its downstream mediators KRAS and NRAS, and its negative regulator CBL. Novel somatic alterations in the AKT/mTOR pathway included copy number gains of the AKT1 locus at 14q32.33 in 19% of patients, with corresponding upregulation of AKT1 expression. We identified loss-of-function mutations in BCORL1, a transcriptional co-repressor and tumour suppressor. We report significant enrichment of novel and rare germline variants in JMJD1C, which codes for a histone demethylase and is a coactivator of the androgen receptor, among Japanese IGCT patients. This study establishes a molecular foundation for understanding the biology of IGCTs and suggests potentially promising therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway.","[Wang, Linghua; Chang, Kyle; Doddapaneni, Harshavardhan; Lewis, Lora; Wang, Mark; Muzny, Donna M.; Gibbs, Richard A.; Wheeler, David A.] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shigeru; Terashima, Keita; Lau, Ching C.] Baylor Coll Med, Texas Childrens Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shigeru; Terashima, Keita; Lau, Ching C.] Baylor Coll Med, Texas Childrens Hematol Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Burstein, Matthew D.] Baylor Coll Med, Struct & Computat Biol & Mol Biophys Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Burstein, Matthew D.; Sun, Jiayi; Lau, Ching C.] Baylor Coll Med, Med Scientist Training Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Terashima, Keita] Natl Ctr Child Hlth & Dev, Tokyo 1578535, Japan; [Ng, Ho-Keung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Prince Wales Hosp, Dept Anat & Cellular Pathol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nakamura, Hideo] Kumamoto Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Kumamoto 8600862, Japan; [He, Zongxiao; Leal, Suzanne M.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Ctr Stat Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Suzuki, Tomonari; Nishikawa, Ryo] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Saitama 3500495, Japan; [Natsume, Atsushi] Nagoya Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Nagoya, Aichi 4668550, Japan; [Terasaka, Shunsuke] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600808, Japan; [Dauser, Robert; Whitehead, William] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosurg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Adekunle, Adesina] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Qiao, Yi; Marth, Gabor] Boston Coll, Dept Biol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Lau, Ching C.] Baylor Coll Med, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Wheeler, DA (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",wheeler@bcm.edu; cclau@txch.org,"Yamaguchi, Shigeru/G-5419-2012; Ng, Ho Keung/I-3952-2015; Natsume, Atsushi/I-7364-2014","Yamaguchi, Shigeru/0000-0003-3710-5888; Natsume, Atsushi/0000-0002-9113-0470","National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [5U54HG003273]; Children Brain Tumor Foundation; Gillson Longenbaugh Foundation; Anderson Charitable Foundation; CCBTP Fellowship from the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) [RP101489]; St Baldrick's Foundation; NLM predoctoral fellowships [5T15 LM07093-18, 5T15 LM07093-19]","This work was supported by research funding from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI, grant number 5U54HG003273) to D.

Here we find that Sox2, a transcription factor expressed in various types of embryonic and adult stem cells(5,6), was the most upregulated transcription factor in the CSCs of squamous skin tumours in mice. SOX2 is absent in normal epidermis but begins to be expressed in the vast majority of mouse and human pre-neoplastic skin tumours, and continues to be expressed in a heterogeneous manner in invasive mouse and human SCCs. In contrast to other SCCs, in which SOX2 is frequently genetically amplified(7), the expression of SOX2 in mouse and human skin SCCs is transcriptionally regulated. Conditional deletion of Sox2 in the mouse epidermis markedly decreases skin tumour formation after chemical-induced carcinogenesis. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter of Sox2 transcriptional expression (SOX2-GFP knock-in mice), we showed that SOX2-expressing cells in invasive SCC are greatly enriched in tumour-propagating cells, which further increase upon serial transplantations. Lineage ablation of SOX2-expressing cells within primary benign and malignant SCCs leads to tumour regression, consistent with the critical role of SOX2-expressing cells in tumour maintenance. Conditional Sox2 deletion in pre-existing skin papilloma and SCC leads to tumour regression and decreases the ability of cancer cells to be propagated upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, supporting the essential role of SOX2 in regulating CSC functions. Transcriptional profiling of SOX2-GFP expressing CSCs and of tumour epithelial cells upon Sox2 deletion uncovered a gene network regulated by SOX2 in primary tumour cells in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified several direct SOX2 target genes controlling tumour stemness, survival, proliferation, adhesion, invasion and paraneoplastic syndrome. We demonstrate that SOX2, by marking and regulating the functions of skin tumour-initiating cells and CSCs, establishes a continuum between tumour initiation and progression in primary skin tumours.","[Boumahdi, Soufiane; Driessens, Gregory; Lapouge, Gaelle; Nassar, Dany; Caauwe, Amelie; Lenglez, Sandrine; Nkusi, Erwin; Dubois, Christine; Beck, Benjamin; Blanpain, Cedric] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Rorive, Sandrine; Le Mercier, Marie; Salmon, Isabelle] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Erasme Hosp, Dept Pathol, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Rorive, Sandrine; Salmon, Isabelle] CMMI, DIAPATH, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Delatte, Benjamin; Fuks, Francois] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Canc Epigenet, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Brohee, Sylvain] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Machine Learning Grp, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [del Marmol, Veronique] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Erasme Hosp, Dept Dermatol, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Blanpain, Cedric] Univ Libre Bruxelles, WELBIO, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Blanpain, C (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",Cedric.Blanpain@ulb.ac.be,,"Delatte, Benjamin/0000-0002-6798-0600",FNRS/FRIA; FNRS; TELEVIE; Brussels Region through the BB2B program; BB2B; IUAP; Fondation Contre le Cancer; ULB foundation; Fonds Yvonne Boel; Fonds Gaston Ithier; foundation Bettencourt Schueller; European Research Council,"We thank our colleagues who provided us with reagents.

Here we document a new, unexpected genome maintenance role of Srs2 in the suppression of mutations arising from mis-insertion of ribonucleoside monophosphates during DNA replication. In cells lacking RNase H2, Srs2 unwinds DNA from the 5' side of a nick generated by DNA topoisomerase I-8 at a ribonucleoside monophosphate residue. In addition, Srs2 interacts with and enhances the activity of the nuclease Exo1, to generate a DNA gap in preparation for repair. Srs2-Exo1 thus functions in a new pathway of nick processing-gap filling that mediates tolerance of ribonucleoside monophosphates in the genome.

In even-toed ungulates (artiodactyls, including cattle), limbs are adapted for running as a consequence of progressive reduction of their distal skeleton to symmetrical and elongated middle digits with hoofed phalanges. Here we analyse bovine embryos to establish that polarized gene expression is progressively lost during limb development in comparison to the mouse. Notably, the transcriptional upregulation of the Ptch1 gene, which encodes a Sonic hedgehog (SHH) receptor, is disrupted specifically in the bovine limb bud mesenchyme. This is due to evolutionary alteration of a Ptch1 cis-regulatory module, which no longer responds to graded SHH signalling during bovine handplate development. Our study provides a molecular explanation for the loss of digit asymmetry in bovine limb buds and suggests that modifications affecting the Ptch1 cis-regulatory landscape have contributed to evolutionary diversification of artiodactyl limbs.","[Lopez-Rios, Javier; Duchesne, Amandine; Speziale, Dario; Uenal, Erkan; Ivanek, Robert; Zeller, Rolf] Univ Basel, Dept Biomed, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Duchesne, Amandine; Floriot, Sandrine; Rodriguez, Sabrina] INRA, Genet Anim & Biol Integrat, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Andrey, Guillaume; Duboule, Denis] Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Peterson, Kevin A.; Liu, Jing; McMahon, Andrew P.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Dept Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Germann, Philipp; Uenal, Erkan; Beisel, Christian; Iber, Dagmar] Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Germann, Philipp; Uenal, Erkan; Ivanek, Robert; Beisel, Christian; Iber, Dagmar] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Barbey, Sarah; Gallard, Yves] INRA, Domaine Expt Pin Haras, F-61310 Exmes, France; [Mueller-Gerbl, Magdalena] Univ Basel, Dept Biomed, Inst Anat, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Courtney, Andrew D.; Wicking, Carol] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Klopp, Christophe] INRA, Biometrie & Intelligence Artificielle, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Robert, Benoit] Inst Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France; [Robert, Benoit] CNRS, URA 2578, F-75015 Paris, France; [Duboule, Denis] Univ Geneva, Dept Genet & Evolut, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Zeller, R (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Biomed, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",amandine.duchesne@jouy.inra.fr; rolf.zeller@unibas.ch,"Lopez-Rios, Javier/D-8094-2014; Zeller, Rolf /C-2610-2013; Germann, Philipp/M-6769-2015","Lopez-Rios, Javier/0000-0001-6731-3798; Germann, Philipp/0000-0002-2057-4883; Zeller, Rolf/0000-0002-3186-7403; Wicking, Carol/0000-0002-7225-3803; Christophe, KLOPP/0000-0001-7126-5477; Andrey, Guillaume/0000-0002-0911-4907",SNF [31003A_130803/146248]; University of Basel; EU [PERG-GA-2009-246576]; SystemsX.ch iPhD Grant [20101078]; INRA; ANR grant [06-MRAR-027-01]; EPFL; ERC grant SystemsHox.ch; NIH grant [NS 033642]; Australian National Health; Medical Research Council [569713],"We thank K.

Seven LPS transport proteins (that is, LptA-LptG) form a trans-envelope protein complex responsible for the transport of LPS from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, the mechanism for which is poorly understood. Here we report the first crystal structure of the unique integral membrane LPS translocon LptD-LptE complex. LptD forms a novel 26-stranded beta-barrel, which is to our knowledge the largest beta-barrel reported so far. LptE adopts a roll-like structure located inside the barrel of LptD to form an unprecedented two-protein 'barrel and plug' architecture. The structure, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays suggest that the hydrophilic O-antigen and the core oligosaccharide of the LPS may pass through the barrel and the lipid A of the LPS may be inserted into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane through a lateral opening between strands beta 1 and beta 26 of LptD. These findings not only help us to understand important aspects of bacterial outer membrane biogenesis, but also have significant potential for the development of novel drugs against multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria.","[Dong, Haohao; Gu, Yinghong; Wang, Zhongshan; Dong, Changjiang] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Biomed Res Ctr, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Dong, Haohao; Xiang, Quanju; Wang, Zhongshan; He, Chuan] Univ St Andrews, Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland; [Xiang, Quanju] Sichuan Agr Univ, Dept Microbiol, Coll Resource & Environm Sci, Yaan 625000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhongshan; Zhang, Yizheng] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Paterson, Neil G.] Diamond Light Source, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Stansfeld, Phillip J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [He, Chuan] Wuhan Tech Coll Commun, Sch Elect & Informat, Wuhan 430065, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenjian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Lab Dept Surg, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Dong, CJ (reprint author), Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Biomed Res Ctr, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",wenjian166@googlemail.com; c.dong@uea.ac.uk,,"Gu, Yinghong/0000-0002-9364-1389; Wang, Zhongshan/0000-0002-1321-3916; Stansfeld, Phill/0000-0001-8800-7669; Paterson, Neil/0000-0003-4292-6971",China Scholarship Council,"We thank T.

Previous searches for compact black hole systems concluded that they were rare(9), with the tightest binary system having a separation of 7 parsecs (ref. 10). Here we report observations of a triple black hole system at redshift z = 0.39, with the closest pair separated by about 140 parsecs and significantly more distant from Earth than any other known binary of comparable orbital separation. The effect of the tight pair is to introduce a rotationally symmetric helical modulation on the structure of the large-scale radio jets, which provides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremely high resolution observations. As we found this tight pair after searching only six galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hitherto believed, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequency gravitational wave experiments(11,12).","[Deane, R.

Recently, a charge superlattice model that positions a small electron-like Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the nodes (where the superconducting gap is minimum)(8,9,16,17) has been proposed as a replacement for the prevalent superlatticemodels(10-14) that position the Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the pseudogap at the antinodes (where the superconducting gap is maximum)(18). Although some ingredients of symmetry breaking have been recently revealed by crystallographic studies, their relevance to the electronic structure remains unresolved(19-21). Here we report angle-resolved quantum oscillation measurements in the underdoped copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6+x. These measurements reveal a normal ground state comprising electron-like Fermi surface pockets located in the vicinity of the nodes, and also point to an underlying superlattice structure of low frequency and long wavelength with features in common with the charge order identified recently by complementary spectroscopic techniques(14,19-22).","[Sebastian, Suchitra E.; Lonzarich, G.

In a different context, plasmonic metasurfaces (thin conductor-dielectric composite materials) have been proposed as a way of strongly enhancing light-matter interaction and realizing ultrathin planarized devices with exotic wave properties(8-11). Here we propose and experimentally realize metasurfaces with a record-high nonlinear response based on the coupling of electromagnetic modes in plasmonic metasurfaces with quantum-engineered electronic intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. We show that it is possible to engineer almost any element of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of these structures, and we experimentally verify this concept by realizing a 400-nm-thick metasurface with nonlinear susceptibility of greater than 5 x 10(4) picometres per volt for second harmonic generation at a wavelength of about 8 micrometres under normal incidence. This susceptibility is many orders of magnitude larger than any second-order nonlinear response in optical metasurfaces measured so far(12-15). The proposed structures can act as ultrathin highly nonlinear optical elements that enable efficient frequency mixing with relaxed phase-matching conditions, ideal for realizing broadband frequency up-and down-conversions, phase conjugation and all-optical control and tunability over a surface.","[Lee, Jongwon; Tymchenko, Mykhailo; Argyropoulos, Christos; Chen, Pai-Yen; Lu, Feng; Alu, Andrea; Belkin, Mikhail A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Demmerle, Frederic; Boehm, Gerhard; Amann, Markus-Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Walter Schottky Inst, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Belkin, MA (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",mbelkin@ece.utexas.edu,"Argyropoulos, Christos/B-4846-2010; Alu, Andrea/A-1328-2007","Argyropoulos, Christos/0000-0002-8481-8648; Alu, Andrea/0000-0002-4297-5274; Tymchenko, Mykhailo/0000-0003-4156-3531",NSF EAGER grant [1348049]; AFOSR YIP award [FA9550-10-1-0076]; AFOSR YIP [FA9550-11-1-0009]; ONR MURI grant [N00014-10-1-0942]; Excellence Cluster 'Nano Initiative Munich (NIM)',"This work was supported by NSF EAGER grant no. 1348049 (to M.A.B. and A.A.), AFOSR YIP award no.

Although quantum dot spin qubits have demonstrated long coherence times, their manipulation is often slower than desired for important future applications, such as factoring(19). Furthermore, scalability and manufacturability are enhanced when qubits are as simple as possible. Previous work has increased the speed of spin qubit rotations by making use of integrated micromagnets(11), dynamic pumping of nuclear spins(12) or the addition of a third quantum dot(17). Here we demonstrate a qubit that is a hybrid of spin and charge. It is simple, requiring neither nuclear-state preparation nor micromagnets. Unlike previous double-dot qubits, the hybrid qubit enables fast rotations about two axes of the Bloch sphere. We demonstrate full control on the Bloch sphere with pi-rotation times of less than 100 picoseconds in two orthogonal directions, which is more than an order of magnitude faster than any other double-dot qubit. The speed arises from the qubit's charge-like characteristics, and its spin-like features result in resistance to decoherence over a wide range of gate voltages. We achieve full process tomography in our electrically controlled semiconductor quantum dot qubit, extracting high fidelities of 85 per cent for X rotations (transitions between qubit states) and 94 per cent for Z rotations (phase accumulation between qubit states).","[Kim, Dohun; Shi, Zhan; Simmons, C.

The abrupt temperature rise in the Northern Hemisphere and the restart of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at the start of the Bolling-Allerod interstadial, 14,700 years ago, are among the most dramatic deglacial events(3), but their underlying physical causes are not known. Here we show that the release of heat from warm waters in the deep North Atlantic Ocean probably triggered the Bolling-Allerod warming and reinvigoration of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our results are based on coupled radiocarbon and uranium-series dates, along with clumped isotope temperature estimates, from water column profiles of fossil deep-sea corals in a limited area of the western North Atlantic. We find that during Heinrich stadial 1 (the cool period immediately before the Bolling-Allerod interstadial), the deep ocean was about three degrees Celsius warmer than shallower waters above. This reversal of the ocean's usual thermal stratification pre-dates the Bolling-Allerod warming and must have been associated with increased salinity at depth to preserve the static stability of the water column. The depleted radiocarbon content of the warm and salty water mass implies a long-term disconnect from rapid surface exchanges, and, although uncertainties remain, is most consistent with a Southern Ocean source. The Heinrich stadial 1 ocean profile is distinct from the modern water column, that for the Last Glacial Maximum and that for the Younger Dryas, suggesting that the patterns we observe are a unique feature of the deglacial climate system. Our observations indicate that the deep ocean influenced dramatic Northern Hemisphere warming by storing heat at depth that preconditioned the system for a subsequent abrupt overturning event during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial.","[Thiagarajan, Nivedita; Subhas, Adam V.; Eiler, John M.; Adkins, Jess F.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Southon, John R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Earth Syst Sci Dept, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Thiagarajan, N (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",nivedita@gps.caltech.edu,,,,,,72,27,27,6,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jul,2014,511,7507,,,,,75,U409,,10.1038/nature13472,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AK1TN,WOS:000338199400038,24990748,No,,,11/20/17

However, the biological context under which pennaceous feathers evolved is still debated. Here we describe a new specimen of Archaeopteryx with extensive feather preservation, not only on the wings and tail, but also on the body and legs. The new specimen shows that the entire body was covered in pennaceous feathers, and that the hindlimbs had long, symmetrical feathers along the tibiotarsus but short feathers on the tarsometatarsus. Furthermore, the wing plumage demonstrates that several recent interpretations(8,9) are problematic. An analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of pennaceous feathers on the tail, hindlimb and arms of advanced maniraptorans and basal avialans strongly indicates that these structures evolved in a functional context other than flight, most probably in relation to display, as suggested by some previous studies(10-12). Pennaceous feathers thus represented an exaptation and were later, in several lineages and following different patterns, recruited for aerodynamic functions. This indicates that the origin of flight in avialans was more complex than previously thought and might have involved several convergent achievements of aerial abilities.","[Foth, Christian; Rauhut, Oliver W.

In the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) species complex, a ring of populations wraps around Tibet. Two reproductively isolated forms co-exist in central Siberia, with a gradient of genetic and phenotypic characteristics through the southern chain of populations connecting them(4-6). Previous genetic evidence has proven inconclusive, however, regarding whether species divergence took place in the face of continuous gene flow and whether hybridization between the terminal forms of the ring ever occurred(7-9). Here we use genome-wide analyses to show that, although spatial patterns of genetic variation are currently mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene flow have existed at more than one location around the ring, and the two Siberian forms have occasionally interbred. Substantial periods of geographical isolation occurred not only in the north but also in the western Himalayas, where there is now an extensive hybrid zone between genetically divergent forms. Limited asymmetric introgression has occurred directly between the Siberian forms, although it has not caused a blending of those forms, suggesting selection against introgressed genes in the novel genetic background. Levels of reproductive isolation and genetic introgression are consistent with levels of phenotypic divergence around the ring, with phenotypic similarity and extensive interbreeding across the southwestern contact zone and strong phenotypic divergence and nearly complete reproductive isolation across the northern contact zone. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the greenish warbler should be viewed as a rare example of speciation by distance(6), but demonstrate that the greenish warbler displays a continuum from slightly divergent neighbouring populations to almost fully reproductively isolated species.","[Alcaide, Miguel; Irwin, Darren E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Alcaide, Miguel; Irwin, Darren E.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Alcaide, Miguel] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Scordato, Elizabeth S.

Beginning at the four-cell stage, imprinted XCI (iXCI) exclusively silences the paternal X chromosome. Later, around implantation, epiblast cells of the inner cell mass that give rise to the embryo reactivate the paternal X chromosome and undergo a random form of XCI (rXCI)(1,2). Xist, a long non-coding RNA crucial for both forms of XCI, is activated by the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (also known as Rnf12)(3-5). Although RLIM is required for triggering iXCI in mice, its importance for rXCI has been controversial. Here we show that RLIM levels are downregulated in embryonic cells undergoing rXCI. Using mouse genetics we demonstrate that female cells lacking RLIM from pre-implantation stages onwards show hallmarks of XCI, including Xist clouds and H3K27me3 foci, and have full embryogenic potential. These results provide evidence that RLIM is dispensable for rXCI, indicating that in mice an RLIM-independent mechanism activates Xist in the embryo proper.","[Shin, JongDae; Jiao, Baowei; Bach, Ingolf] UMMS, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Wallingford, Mary C.; Marcho, Chelsea; Mager, Jesse] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Gallant, Judith; Byron, Meg; Lawrence, Jeanne B.; Jones, Stephen N.] UMMS, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Bossenz, Michael] Ortenau Klinikum Lahr Ettenheim, Inst Pathol, D-77933 Lahr, Germany; [Bach, Ingolf] UMMS, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Bach, I (reprint author), UMMS, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",Ingolf.bach@umassmed.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health grants [CA131158, CA077735, GM053234]","We are grateful to H.

Responses of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients to cytarabine (Ara-C)-based therapies are often short lived with a median overall survival of months(1-4). Therapies are under development to improve outcomes and include targeting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) with its inhibitor ribavirin(5-7). In a Phase II clinical trial in poor prognosis AML(5), ribavirin monotherapy yielded promising responses including remissions; however, all patients relapsed. Here we identify a novel form of drug resistance to ribavirin and Ara-C. We observe that the sonic hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated protein 1 (GLI1) and the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A) family of enzymes are elevated in resistant cells. UGT1As add glucuronic acid to many drugs, modifying their activity in diverse tissues(8).

Although Ide(-/-) mice have elevated insulin levels, they exhibit impaired, rather than improved, glucose tolerance that may arise from compensatory insulin signalling dysfunction(5,6). IDE inhibitors that are active in vivo are therefore needed to elucidate IDE's physiological roles and to determine its potential to serve as a target for the treatment of diabetes. Here we report the discovery of a physiologically active IDE inhibitor identified from a DNA-templated macrocycle library. An X-ray structure of the macrocycle bound to IDE reveals that it engages a binding pocket away from the catalytic site, which explains its remarkable selectivity. Treatment of lean and obese mice with this inhibitor shows that IDE regulates the abundance and signalling of glucagon and amylin, in addition to that of insulin. Under physiological conditions that augment insulin and amylin levels, such as oral glucose administration, acute IDE inhibition leads to substantially improved glucose tolerance and slower gastric emptying. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of modulating IDE activity as a new therapeutic strategy to treat type-2 diabetes and expand our understanding of the roles of IDE in glucose and hormone regulation.","[Maianti, Juan Pablo; McFedries, Amanda; Kleiner, Ralph E.; Saghatelian, Alan; Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Foda, Zachariah H.; Seeliger, Markus A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Pharmacol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Du, Xiu Quan; Charron, Maureen J.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Leissring, Malcolm A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Inst Memory Impairments & Neurol Disorders, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Tang, Wei-Jen] Univ Chicago, Ben May Dept Canc Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Liu, DR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",saghatelian@chemistry.harvard.edu; drliu@fas.harvard.edu,,"Tang, Wei-Jen/0000-0002-8267-8995","NIH/NIGMS [R01 GM065865, R00 GM080097, R01 GM81539, T32 GM008444, F30 CA174152, DP2 OD002374]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Diabetes and Cancer Centers of Albert Einstein College of Medicine; American Diabetes Association [7-11-CD-06]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund CABS; Searle Scholars Program; Fonds de Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ); Alfred Bader Fund","This research was supported by NIH/NIGMS (R01 GM065865 (D.R.L.), R00 GM080097 (M.A.S.), R01 GM81539 (W.-J.T.), T32 GM008444 (Z.H.F.), F30 CA174152 (Z.H.F.), DP2 OD002374 (A.S.)), Howard Hughes Medical Institute (D.R.L.), Diabetes and Cancer Centers of Albert Einstein College of Medicine (M.J.C.), American Diabetes Association no. 7-11-CD-06 (M.A.L.), Burroughs Wellcome Fund CABS (A.S.), and the Searle Scholars Program (A.S.).

Despite chemotherapy, the global tuberculosis epidemic has intensified because of HIV co-infection, the lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria(2-5). Alternative host-directed strategies could be exploited to improve treatment efficacy and outcome, contain drug-resistant strains and reduce disease severity and mortality(6). The innate inflammatory response elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents a logical host target(7). Here we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1) confers host resistance through the induction of eicosanoids that limit excessive type I interferon (IFN) production and foster bacterial containment. We further show that, in infected mice and patients, reduced IL-1 responses and/or excessive type I IFN induction are linked to an eicosanoid imbalance associated with disease exacerbation. Host-directed immunotherapy with clinically approved drugs that augment prostaglandin E2 levels in these settings prevented acute mortality of Mtb-infected mice. Thus, IL-1 and type I IFNs represent two major counter-regulatory classes of inflammatory cytokines that control the outcome of Mtb infection and are functionally linked via eicosanoids. Our findings establish proof of concept for host-directed treatment strategies that manipulate the host eicosanoid network and represent feasible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy.","[Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Sher, Alan] NIAID, Immunobiol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Amaral, Eduardo P.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Immunol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barber, Daniel L.] NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Unit T, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gonzales, Jacqueline; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III] NIAID, TB Res Sect, Lab Clin Infect Dis, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Derrick, Steven C.] US FDA, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shi, Ruiru; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing] Henan Chest Hosp, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Babu, Subash] Int Ctr Excellence Res, NIH, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan] NIRT, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Zhang, Guolong] SinoUS Int Res Ctr TB, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guolong] Henan Publ Hlth Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Babu, Subash] NIAID, Helminth Immunol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Catalfamo, Marta] NIAID, Clin & Mol Retrovirol Sect, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Salazar, Andres M.] Oncovir Inc, Washington, DC 20008 USA","Mayer-Barber, KD (reprint author), NIAID, Immunobiol Sect, LPD, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mayerk@niaid.nih.gov,"Amaral, Eduardo/M-2456-2014; Andrade, Bruno/J-9111-2012; Barry, III, Clifton/H-3839-2012","Amaral, Eduardo/0000-0001-5465-8113; Andrade, Bruno/0000-0001-6833-3811; Via, Laura/0000-0001-6074-9521","NIAID Intramural Research program; Concept Acceleration Program-Award from DMID, NIAID","This work was supported by the NIAID Intramural Research program and a Concept Acceleration Program-Award (K.D.M.-B., B.B.A. and A.S.) from DMID, NIAID.

In archaea and eukaryotes, RNA ligases also have a role in transfer RNA splicing to generate functional tRNAs required for protein synthesis(4-7). We recently identified the human tRNA splicing ligase, a multimeric protein complex with RTCB (also known as HSPC117, C22orf28, FAAP and D10Wsu52e) as the essential subunit(8). The functions of the additional complex components ASW (also known as C2orf49), CGI-99 (also known as C14orf166), FAM98B and the DEAD-box helicase DDX1 in the context of RNA ligation have remained unclear. Taking advantage of clusters of eukaryotic orthologous groups, here we find that archease (ARCH; also known as ZBTB8OS), a protein of unknown function, is required for full activity of the human tRNA ligase complex and, in cooperation with DDX1, facilitates the formation of an RTCB-guanylate intermediate central to mammalian RNA ligation. Our findings define a role for DDX1 in the context of the human tRNA ligase complex and suggest that the widespread co-occurrence of archease and RtcB proteins implies evolutionary conservation of their functional interplay.","[Popow, Johannes; Jurkin, Jennifer; Martinez, Javier] Austrian Acad Sci IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Popow, Johannes] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schleiffer, Alexander] Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, IMP IMBA Bioinformat Core Facil, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Martinez, J (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",javier.martinez@imba.oeaw.ac.at,,"Popow, Johannes/0000-0002-1093-0936; Schleiffer, Alexander/0000-0001-6251-2747",Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung [P24687]; GEN-AU 3 research programme [820982]; Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences,"We would like to thank S.

In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer leaflet of the outer membrane is composed predominantly of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)(1). The export of LPS requires seven essential lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins to move LPS from the inner membrane, through the periplasm to the surfac(2)e. Of the seven Lpt proteins, the LptD-LptE complex is responsible for inserting LPS into the external leaflet of the outer membrane(3,4). Here we report the crystal structure of the similar to 110-kilodalton membrane protein complex LptD-LptE from Shigella flexneri at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals an unprecedented two-protein plug-and-barrel architecture with LptE embedded into a 26-stranded beta-barrel formed by LptD. Importantly, the secondary structures of the first two beta-strands are distorted by two proline residues, weakening their interactions with neighbouring beta-strands and creating a potential portal on the barrel wall that could allow lateral diffusion of LPS into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the LptD-LptE complex opens the door to new antibiotic strategies targeting the bacterial outer membrane.","[Qiao, Shuai; Luo, Qingshan; Zhao, Yan; Zhang, Xuejun Cai; Huang, Yihua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Ctr Prot Sci Beijing, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shuai; Luo, Qingshan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yan] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China","Huang, YH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Ctr Prot Sci Beijing, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yihuahuang@sun5.ibp.ac.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB917302, 2013CB910603]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB080203]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31170698]","The authors thank Y.

Here we show the viability of a fundamentally new approach to nuclear warhead verification that incorporates a zero-knowledge protocol, which is designed in such a way that sensitive information is never measured and so does not need to be hidden. We interrogate submitted items with energetic neutrons, making, in effect, differential measurements of both neutron transmission and emission. Calculations for scenarios in which material is diverted from a test object show that a high degree of discrimination can be achieved while revealing zero information. Our ideas for a physical zero-knowledge system could have applications beyond the context of nuclear disarmament.

AlaRS interacts with both the minor-and the major-groove sides of G3 center dot U70, widening the major groove. The geometry difference between G3 center dot U70 and A3 center dot U70 is transmitted along the acceptor stemto the 3'-CCA region. Thus, the 3'-CCA region of tRNA(Ala) with G3 center dot U70 is oriented to the reactive route that reaches the active site, whereas that of the A3 center dot U70 variant is folded back into the non-reactive route. This novel mechanism enables the single wobble pair to dominantly determine the specificity of tRNA selection, by an approximate 100-fold difference in k(cat) .","[Naganuma, Masahiro; Sekine, Shun-ichi; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Naganuma, Masahiro; Sekine, Shun-ichi; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem & Lab Struct Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Naganuma, Masahiro; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN Struct Biol Lab, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Sekine, Shun-ichi] RIKEN Ctr Life Sci Technol, Div Struct & Synthet Biol, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Chong, Yeeting Esther; Guo, Min; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chong, Yeeting Esther; Guo, Min; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gamper, Howard; Hou, Ya-Ming] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Florida Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Yokoyama, S (reprint author), RIKEN Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",yokoyama@riken.jp,"Sekine, Shun-ichi/N-5450-2015; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/N-6911-2015","Sekine, Shun-ichi/0000-0001-8174-8704; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-3133-7338; Hou, Ya-Ming/0000-0001-6546-2597","Targeted Proteins Research Program; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20247008]; MEXT; Global COE Program (Integrative Life Science Based on the Study of Biosignaling Mechanisms) from MEXT; National Institutes of Health [GM015539, GM023562, NS085092]","We are grateful to the staff of the beam line AR-NW12A at the Photon Factory and the beam lines BL32XU and BL41XU at SPring-8 for their assistance during data collection.

Their biosynthetic machinery, represented by type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), has an architecture in which successive modules catalyse two-carbon linear extensions and keto-group processing reactions on intermediates covalently tethered to carrier domains. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy to determine sub-nanometre-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of a full-length PKS module from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture compared to the homologous dimeric mammalian fatty acid synthase. A single reaction chamber provides access to all catalytic sites for the intramodule carrier domain. In contrast, the carrier from the preceding module uses a separate entrance outside the reaction chamber to deliver the upstream polyketide intermediate for subsequent extension and modification. This study reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, the structural basis for both intramodule and intermodule substrate transfer in polyketide synthases, and establishes a new model for molecular dissection of these multifunctional enzyme systems.","[Dutta, Somnath; Whicher, Jonathan R.; Hansen, Douglas A.; Chemler, Joseph A.; Congdon, Grady R.; Narayan, Alison R.

The weakness of the gravitational interaction and the impossibility of shielding the effects of gravity make it very difficult to measure G while keeping systematic effects under control. Most previous experiments performed were based on the torsion pendulum or torsion balance scheme as in the experiment by Cavendish(2) in 1798, and in all cases macroscopic masses were used. Here we report the precise determination of G using laser-cooled atoms and quantum interferometry. We obtain the value G = 6.67191(99) X 10(-11) m(3) kg(-1) s(-2) with a relative uncertainty of 150 parts per million (the combined standard uncertainty is given in parentheses). Our value differs by 1.5 combined standard deviations from the current recommended value of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology(3). A conceptually different experiment such as ours helps to identify the systematic errors that have proved elusive in previous experiments, thus improving the confidence in the value of G. There is no definitive relationship between G and the other fundamental constants, and there is no theoretical prediction for its value, against which to test experimental results. Improving the precision with which we know G has not only a pure metrological interest, but is also important because of the key role that G has in theories of gravitation, cosmology, particle physics and astrophysics and in geophysical models.","[Rosi, G.; Sorrentino, F.; Tino, G.

In the context of nanoelectronics(3), interest has focused on single-walled carbon nanotubes(4) (SWNTs) because slight changes in tube diameter and wrapping angle, defined by the chirality indices (n,m), will shift their electrical conductivity from one characteristic of a metallic state to one characteristic of a semiconducting state, and will also change the bandgap. However, this structure-function relationship can be fully exploited only with structurally pure SWNTs. Solution-based separation methods(5) yield tubes within a narrow structure range, but the ultimate goal of producing just one type of SWNT by controlling its structure during growth has proved to be a considerable challenge over the last two decades(6-9). Such efforts aim to optimize the composition(6,10-17) or shape(18-21) of the catalyst particles that are used in the chemical vapour deposition synthesis process to decompose the carbon feedstock and influence SWNT nucleation and growth(22-25). This approach resulted in the highest reported proportion, 55 per cent, of single-chirality SWNTs in an as-grown sample(11). Here we show that SWNTs of a single chirality, (12, 6), can be produced directly with an abundance higher than 92 per cent when using tungsten-based bimetallic alloy nanocrystals as catalysts. These, unlike other catalysts used so far, have such high melting points that they maintain their crystalline structure during the chemical vapour deposition process. This feature seems crucial because experiment and simulation both suggest that the highly selective growth of (12, 6) SWNTs is the result of a good structural match between the carbon atom arrangement around the nanotube circumference and the arrangement of the catalytically active atoms in one of the planes of the nanocrystal catalyst. We anticipate that using high-melting-point alloy nanocrystals with optimized structures as catalysts paves the way for total chirality control in SWNT growth and will thus promote the development of SWNT applications.","[Yang, Feng; Wang, Xiao; Zhang, Daqi; Yang, Juan; Luo, Da; Peng, Fei; Li, Ruoming; Li, Yilun; Li, Meihui; Li, Yan] Peking Univ, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Key Lab Phys & Chem Nanodevices, State Key Lab Rare Earth Mat Chem & Applicat,Coll, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ziwei; Ding, Feng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wei, Jiake; Xu, Zhi; Bai, Xuedong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian-Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Li, Xuemei] Peking Univ, Electron Microscopy Lab, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Li, Y (reprint author), Peking Univ, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Key Lab Phys & Chem Nanodevices, State Key Lab Rare Earth Mat Chem & Applicat,Coll, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yanli@pku.edu.cn,"Xu, Zhi/B-8078-2014; Yang, Feng/K-4358-2014; Wang, Jian-Qiang/P-5345-2014; Ding, Feng/D-5938-2011; Li, Yan/D-5497-2009; Yang, Juan/F-5220-2010","Xu, Zhi/0000-0002-0761-4764; Ding, Feng/0000-0001-9153-9279; Li, Yan/0000-0002-3828-8340; Yang, Juan/0000-0001-5502-9351; Li, Yilun/0000-0002-0750-2228","MoST [2011CB933003]; NSFC of China [21125103, 91333105, 21321001, 11179011, 21273189]; Hong Kong GRF research grant [G-YX4Q]","We thank S.

In particular, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 was an exceptionally long interglaciation and potentially had a global mean sea level 6 to 13 metres above the present level around 410,000 to 400,000 years ago(1,2), implying substantial mass loss fromtheGreenland ice sheet (GIS). There are, however, nomodel simulations and only limitedproxy data(3,4) to constrain themagnitude of the GIS response to climate change during this 'super interglacial'(5), thus confounding efforts to assess climate/ice-sheet threshold behaviour(6,7) and associated sea-level rise(1,2). Here we show that the south GIS was drastically smaller during MIS 11 than it is now, with only a small residual ice dome over southernmost Greenland. We use the strontium-neodymium-lead isotopic composition of proglacial sediment discharged from south Greenland to constrain the provenance of terrigenous silt deposited on the Eirik Drift, a sedimentary deposit off the south Greenland margin. We identify a major reduction in sediment input derived from south Greenland's Pre-cambrian bedrock terranes, probably reflecting the cessation of sub-glacial erosion and sediment transport(8) as a result of near-complete deglaciation of south Greenland. Comparison with ice-sheet configurations from numerical models(7,9-12) suggests that the GIS lost about 4.5 to 6 metres of sea-level-equivalent volume during MIS 11. This is evidence for late-Quaternary GIS collapse after it crossed a climate/ice-sheet stability threshold that may have been no more than several degrees above pre-industrial temperatures(6,7).","[Reyes, Alberto V.; Carlson, Anders E.; Beard, Brian L.; Winsor, Kelsey; Welke, Bethany; Ullman, David J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Reyes, Alberto V.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Geog Archaeol & Palaeoecol, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Carlson, Anders E.; Hatfield, Robert G.; Stoner, Joseph S.; Ullman, David J.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Reyes, AV (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",areyes@ualberta.ca; acarlson@coas.oregonstate.edu,,"Reyes, Alberto/0000-0002-7838-4214","US NSF [ANS-0902571, ANS-0902751]; Canadian NSERC fellowship","We thank A. de Vernal for access to pollen records and archived sediment; C.

The theory of cerebellar motor learning(1-3) relies on movement errors signalled by climbing-fibre inputs to cause long-term depression of synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells(4,5). However, a recent review(6) has called into question the widely held view that the climbing-fibre input is an 'all-or-none' event. In anaesthetized animals, there is wide variation in the duration of the complex spike (CS) caused in Purkinje cells by a climbing-fibre input(7). Furthermore, the amount of plasticity in Purkinje cells is graded according to the duration of electrically controlled bursts in climbing fibres(8,9). The duration of bursts depends on the 'state' of the inferior olive and therefore may be correlated across climbing fibres(8,10). Here we provide a potential functional context for these mechanisms during motor learning in behaving monkeys. The magnitudes of both plasticity and motor learning depend on the duration of the CS responses. Furthermore, the duration of CS responses seems to be a meaningful signal that is correlated across the Purkinje-cell population during motor learning. We suggest that during learning, longer bursts in climbing fibres lead to longer-duration CS responses in Purkinje cells, more calcium entry into Purkinje cells, larger synaptic depression, and stronger learning. The same graded impact of instructive signals for plasticity and learning might occur throughout the nervous system.","[Yang, Yan; Lisberger, Stephen G.] Duke Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Lisberger, Stephen G.] Duke Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Lisberger, SG (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",yanyang@neuro.duke.edu; lisberger@neuro.duke.edu,"Yang, Yan/A-8505-2016","Yang, Yan/0000-0002-9139-5532",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health [R01-EY003878],"We thank C.

Although methods to induce pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells by transcription factors(6) are widely used in basic research, numerous differences between induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have been reported(7-11), potentially affecting their clinical use. Because of the therapeutic potential of diploid embryonic stem-cell lines derived from adult cells of diseased human subjects, we have systematically investigated the parameters affecting efficiency of blastocyst development and stem-cell derivation. Here we show that improvements to the oocyte activation protocol, including the use of both kinase and translation inhibitors, and cell culture in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitors, promote development to the blastocyst stage. Developmental efficiency varied between oocyte donors, and was inversely related to the number of days of hormonal stimulation required for oocyte maturation, whereas the daily dose of gonadotropin or the total number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved did not affect developmental outcome. Because the use of concentrated Sendai virus for cell fusion induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, causing premature oocyte activation, we used diluted Sendai virus in calcium-free medium. Using this modified nuclear transfer protocol, we derived diploid pluripotent stem-cell lines from somatic cells of a newborn and, for the first time, an adult, a female with type 1 diabetes.","[Yamada, Mitsutoshi; Johannesson, Bjarki; Paull, Daniel; Nestor, Michael W.; Solomon, Susan L.; Egli, Dieter] New York Stem Cell Fdn Res Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Sagi, Ido; Benvenisty, Nissim] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Silberman Inst Life Sci, Dept Genet, Stem Cell Unit, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Burnett, Lisa Cole; Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin S.; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pediat, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Womens Reprod Care, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, New York, NY 10019 USA","Egli, D (reprint author), New York Stem Cell Fdn Res Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA.",d.egli@nyscf.org,,,New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF); New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) IIRP [C026184]; Russell Berrie Foundation Program in Cellular Therapies of Diabetes,"This research was supported the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) and a New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) IIRP Award no.

Medulloblastoma, a clinically challenging, malignant childhood brain tumour, is no exception. Despite much progress from recent genomics studies, with recurrent changes identified in each of the four distinct tumour subgroups(WNT-pathway-activated, SHH-pathway-activated, and the less-well-characterized Group 3 and Group 4)(2-4), many cases still lack an obvious genetic driver. Here we present whole-genome bisulphite-sequencing data from thirty-four human and five murine tumours plus eight human and three murine normal controls, augmented with matched whole-genome, RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data. This comprehensive data set allowed us to decipher several features underlying the interplay between the genome, epigenome and transcriptome, and its effects on medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Most notable were highly prevalent regions of hypomethylation correlating with increased gene expression, extending tens of kilobases downstream of transcription start sites. Focal regions of low methylation linked to transcription-factor-binding sites shed light on differential transcriptional networks between subgroups, whereas increased methylation due to re-normalization of repressed chromatin in DNA methylation valleys was positively correlated with gene expression. Large, partially methylated domains affecting up to one-third of the genome showed increased mutation rates and gene silencing in a subgroup-specific fashion. Epigenetic alterations also affected novel medulloblastoma candidate genes (for example, LIN28B), resulting in alternative promoter usage and/or differential messenger RNA/microRNA expression. Analysis of mouse medulloblastoma and precursor-cell methylation demonstrated a somatic origin for many alterations. Our data provide insights into the epigenetic regulation of transcription and genome organization in medulloblastoma pathogenesis, which are probably also of importance in a wider developmental and disease context.","[Hovestadt, Volker; Picelli, Simone; Wang, Wei; Kleinheinz, Kortine; Weber, Ursula D.; Zapatka, Marc; Radlwimmer, Bernhard; Lichter, Peter] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Mol Genet, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Jones, David T.

For over half a century, this agent has been prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes world wide, yet the underlying mechanism by which metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that metformin non-competitively inhibits the redox shuttle enzyme mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, resulting in an altered hepatocellular redox state, reduced conversion of lactate and glycerol to glucose, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Acute and chronic low-dose metformin treatment effectively reduced endogenous glucose production, while increasing cytosolic redox and decreasing mitochondrial redox states. Antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of hepatic mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in rats resulted in a phenotype akin to chronic metformin treatment, and abrogated metformin-mediated increases in cytosolic redox state, decreases in plasma glucose concentrations, and inhibition of endogenous glucose production. These findings were replicated in whole-body mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase knockout mice. These results have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of metformin's blood glucose lowering effects and provide a new therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.","[Madiraju, Anila K.; Erion, Derek M.; Rahimi, Yasmeen; Zhang, Xian-Man; Jurczak, Michael J.; Camporez, Joao-Paulo; Lee, Hui-Young; Cline, Gary W.; Samuel, Varman T.; Kibbey, Richard G.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Madiraju, Anila K.; Erion, Derek M.; Kibbey, Richard G.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Madiraju, Anila K.; Erion, Derek M.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Braddock, Demetrios T.; Albright, Ronald A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Prigaro, Brett J.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Wood, John L.] Baylor Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Canc Prevent Res Inst Texas Scholar, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Bhanot, Sanjay] ISIS Pharmaceut, Carlsbad, CA 92010 USA; [MacDonald, Michael J.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Shulman, Gerald I.] Univ Copenhagen, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Shulman, GI (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",gerald.shulman@yale.edu,"Camporez, Joao Paulo/B-9122-2015","Jurczak, Michael/0000-0002-6335-6915","National Institutes of Health [R24 DK-085638, R01 DK-40936, P30 DK-45735, P30 DK-034989, U24 DK-059635, R01 DK-28348, K01 DK-099402, R01 DK-092606]; American Diabetes Association [7-12-BS-092, 1-14-Merck-10]; VA Merit Award [I01-BX000901]; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research","We thank J.

PGC-1 alpha(peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha) links insulin signalling to the expression of glucose and lipid metabolic genes(5-7). The histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (general control non-repressed protein 5) acetylates PGC-1 alpha and suppresses its transcriptional activity, whereas sirtuin 1 deacetylates and activates PGC-1 alpha(8,9). Although insulin is a mitogenic signal in proliferative cells(10,11), whether components of the cell cycle machinery contribute to its metabolic action is poorly understood. Here we report that in mice insulin activates cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), which, in turn, increases GCN5 acetyltransferase activity and suppresses hepatic glucose production independently of cell cycle progression. Through a cell-based high-throughput chemical screen, we identify a Cdk4 inhibitor that potently decreases PGC-1 alpha acetylation. Insulin/GSK-3 beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta) signalling induces cyclin D1 protein stability by sequestering cyclin D1 in the nucleus. In parallel, dietary amino acids increase hepatic cyclin D1 messenger RNA transcripts. Activated cyclin D1-Cdk4 kinase phosphorylates and activates GCN5, which then acetylates and inhibits PGC-1 alpha activity on gluconeogenic genes. Loss of hepatic cyclin D1 results in increased gluconeogenesis and hyperglycaemia. In diabetic models, cyclin D1-Cdk4 is chronically elevated and refractory to fasting/feeding transitions; nevertheless further activation of this kinase normalizes glycaemia. Our findings show that insulin uses components of the cell cycle machinery in post-mitotic cells to control glucose homeostasis independently of cell division.","[Lee, Yoonjin; Dominy, John E.; Choi, Yoon Jong; Chim, Helen; Lim, Ji-Hong; Vazquez, Francisca; Sicinski, Piotr; Puigserver, Pere] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lee, Yoonjin; Dominy, John E.; Chim, Helen; Lim, Ji-Hong; Vazquez, Francisca; Puigserver, Pere] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lee, Yoonjin] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Choi, Yoon Jong; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jurczak, Michael; Camporez, Joao Paulo; Ruan, Hai-Bin; Yang, Xiaoyong; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yales Mouse Metab Phenotyping Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Jurczak, Michael; Camporez, Joao Paulo; Ruan, Hai-Bin; Yang, Xiaoyong; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Jurczak, Michael; Camporez, Joao Paulo; Ruan, Hai-Bin; Yang, Xiaoyong; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Tolliday, Nicola] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Chem Biol Platform, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA","Puigserver, P (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",pere_puigserver@dfci.harvard.edu,"Ruan, Hai-Bin/G-9907-2012; Camporez, Joao Paulo/B-9122-2015","Ruan, Hai-Bin/0000-0002-3858-1272; Jurczak, Michael/0000-0002-6335-6915","Ewha Womans University; National Research Service Award Kirschstein Fellowship from the National Institutes of Health (NIH); Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; American Diabetes Association; Department of Defense; NIH/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R01069966, R24DK080261-06]; NIH [R03 MH092174, R01 CA108420, DK059635]","We thank all the members of the Puigserver laboratory for discussions and suggestions about this project.

The mechanisms of such exchange, which allows lipid transfer independently of vesicular transport, remain poorly understood. The presence of a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain, a proposed lipid-binding module, in several proteins localized at membrane contact sites has raised the possibility that such domains may be implicated in lipid transport(1,2). SMP-containing proteins include components of the ERMES complex, an ER-mitochondrial tether(3), and the extended synaptotagmins (known as tricalbins in yeast), which are ER-PM tethers(4-6). Here we present at 2.44 angstrom resolution the crystal structure of a fragment of human extended synaptotagmin 2 (E-SYT2), including an SMP domain and two adjacent C2 domains. The SMP domain has a beta-barrel structure like protein modules in the tubular-lipid-binding (TULIP) superfamily. It dimerizes to form an approximately 90-angstrom-long cylinder traversed by a channel lined entirely with hydrophobic residues, with the two C2A-C2B fragments forming arched structures flexibly linked to the SMP domain. Importantly, structural analysis complemented by mass spectrometry revealed the presence of glycerophospholipids in the E-SYT2 SMP channel, indicating a direct role for E-SYTs in lipid transport. These findings provide strong evidence for a role of SMP-domain-containing proteins in the control of lipid transfer at membrane contact sites and have broad implications beyond the field of ER-to-PM appositions.","[Schauder, Curtis M.; Wu, Xudong; Saheki, Yasunori; De Camilli, Pietro; Reinisch, Karin M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Saheki, Yasunori; De Camilli, Pietro] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Program Cellular Neurosci Neurodegenerat & Repair, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Saheki, Yasunori; De Camilli, Pietro] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Narayanaswamy, Pradeep] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Torta, Federico; Wenk, Markus R.] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Singapore 117599, Singapore","Reinisch, KM (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",pietro.decamilli@yale.edu; karin.reinisch@yale.edu,"Wenk, Markus/D-1441-2014; Saheki, Yasunori/D-5430-2016","Saheki, Yasunori/0000-0002-1229-6668; Torta, Federico/0000-0001-7545-7484","National Institutes of Health [GM080616, R37NS36251, DK082700]; National University of Singapore via the Life Sciences Institute (LSI); Biochemical Research Council [BMRC-SERC Diag-034]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1122492]; Uehara Memorial Foundation; Japanese Society for Promotion of Science","We are grateful to the staff at NE-CAT beamline 24ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source for assistance with data collection.

Stalled replication forks may be processed by sister chromatid recombination (SCR), generating error-free or error-prone homologous recombination (HR) outcomes(4-8). In mammalian cells, a long-standing hypothesis proposes that the major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer predisposition gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2, control HR/SCR at stalled replication forks(9). Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 affect replication fork processing(10-12), direct evidence that BRCA gene products regulate homologous recombination at stalled chromosomal replication forks is lacking, due to a dearth of tools for studying this process. Here we report that the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter complex(13-16) can be engineered to induce site-specific replication fork stalling and chromosomal HR/SCR in mouse cells. Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination entails processing of bidirectionally arrested forks. We find that the Brca1 carboxy (C)-terminal tandem BRCT repeat and regions of Brca1 encoded by exon 11-two Brca1 elements implicated in tumour suppression-control Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination. Inactivation of either Brca1 or Brca2 increases the absolute frequency of 'long-tract' gene conversions at Tus/Ter-stalled forks, an outcome not observed in response to a site-specific endonuclease-mediated chromosomal double-strand break. Therefore, homologous recombination at stalled forks is regulated differently from homologous recombination at double-strand breaks arising independently of a replication fork. We propose that aberrant long-tract homologous recombination at stalled replication forks contributes to genomic instability and breast/ovarian cancer predisposition in BRCA mutant cells.","[Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Scully, Ralph] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Scully, Ralph] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Follonier, Cindy] Princeton Univ, Lewis Thomas Lab 101, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Deng, Chuxia] NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA","Scully, R (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, 330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",rscully@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Scully, Ralph/F-5008-2013; deng, chuxia/N-6713-2016",,"NIH [R01CA095175, R01GM073894, R21CA144017, R37GM26938]; NIH/NCI [5T32CA081156]; ACS [PF-12-248-01-DMC]","We thank B.

The architecture of a full-length PKS module from the pikromycin pathway of Streptomyces venezuelae creates a reaction chamber for the intra-module acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that carries building blocks and intermediates between acyltransferase, ketosynthase and ketoreductase active sites (see accompanying paper(2)). Here we determine electron cryo-microscopy structures of a full-length pikromycin PKS module in three key biochemical states of its catalytic cycle. Each biochemical state was confirmed by bottom-up liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The ACP domain is differentially and precisely positioned after polyketide chain substrate loading on the active site of the ketosynthase, after extension to the beta-keto intermediate, and after beta-hydroxy product generation. The structures reveal the ACP dynamics for sequential interactions with catalytic domains within the reaction chamber, and for transferring the elongated and processed polyketide substrate to the next module in the PKS pathway. During the enzymatic cycle the ketoreductase domain undergoes dramatic conformational rearrangements that enable optimal positioning for reductive processing of the ACP-bound polyketide chain elongation intermediate. These findings have crucial implications for the design of functional PKS modules, and for the engineering of pathways to generate pharmacologically relevant molecules.","[Whicher, Jonathan R.; Dutta, Somnath; Hansen, Douglas A.; Chemler, Joseph A.; Dosey, Annie M.; Narayan, Alison R.

Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via 'magic state' distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple 'hidden variable' model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.","[Howard, Mark] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Math Phys, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Veitch, Victor] Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada","Emerson, J (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",jemerson@math.uwaterloo.ca,,"Wallman, Joel/0000-0001-6943-5334; Howard, Mark/0000-0002-6910-185X",Irish Research Council (IRC) as part of the Empower Fellowship programme; CIFAR; Government of Canada through NSERC,"M.H. was supported by the Irish Research Council (IRC) as part of the Empower Fellowship programme, and all authors acknowledge support from CIFAR and the Government of Canada through NSERC.",,48,88,89,4,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2014,510,7505,,,,,351,355,,10.1038/nature13460,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AJ0NG,WOS:000337350200026,24919152,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Eucalyptus also shows the highest diversity of genes for specialized metabolites such as terpenes that act as chemical defence and provide unique pharmaceutical oils. Genome sequencing of the E. grandis sister species E. globulus and a set of inbred E. grandis tree genomes reveals dynamic genome evolution and hotspots of inbreeding depression. The E. grandis genome is the first reference for the eudicot order Myrtales and is placed here sister to the eurosids.

Here we sequence single-cell RNA-seq libraries prepared from over 1,700 primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial variation between identically stimulated dendritic cells, in both the fraction of cells detectably expressing a given messenger RNA and the transcript's level within expressing cells. Distinct gene modules are characterized by different temporal heterogeneity profiles. In particular, a 'core' module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few 'precocious' cells in response to uniform stimulation with a pathogenic component, but is later activated in all cells. By stimulating cells individually in sealed microfluidic chambers, analysing dendritic cells from knockout mice, and modulating secretion and extracellular signalling, we show that this response is coordinated by interferon-mediated paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably, preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially reduces variability between cells in the expression of an early-induced 'peaked' inflammatory module, suggesting that paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that multicellular populations can use to establish complex dynamic responses.","[Shalek, Alex K.; Gertner, Rona S.; Gaublomme, Jellert T.; Ding, Ruihua; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shalek, Alex K.; Gertner, Rona S.; Gaublomme, Jellert T.; Ding, Ruihua; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shalek, Alex K.; Satija, Rahul; Trombetta, John J.; Gennert, Dave; Lu, Diana; Yosef, Nir; Schwartz, Schraga; Raychowdhury, Raktima; Hacohen, Nir; Park, Hongkun; Regev, Aviv] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Shuga, Joe; Chen, Peilin; Fowler, Brian; Weaver, Suzanne; Wang, Jing; Wang, Xiaohui; May, Andrew P.] Fluidigm Corp, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Friedman, Nir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Hacohen, Nir] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Hacohen, Nir] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA","Satija, R (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",rahuls@broadinstitute.org; Hongkun_Park@harvard.edu; apmay1@gmail.com,"Friedman, Nir/H-9692-2012","Friedman, Nir/0000-0002-9678-3550; Schwartz, Schraga/0000-0002-3671-9709; Shalek, Alex K./0000-0001-5670-8778","NIH [1F32HD075541-01, U54 AI057159, DP2 OD002230, 5DP1OD003893-03, DP1OD003958-01]; NIH CEGS [1P50HG006193-01]; Broad Institute; Klarman Cell Observatory at the Broad Institute; ISF-Broad Grant; ERC","We thank B.

Here we report that USP30, a deubiquitinase localized to mitochondria, antagonizes mitophagy driven by the ubiquitin ligase parkin (also known as PARK2) and protein kinase PINK1, which are encoded by two genes associated with Parkinson's disease. Parkin ubiquitinates and tags damaged mitochondria for clearance. Overexpression of USP 30 removes ubiquitin attached by parkin onto damaged mitochondria and blocks parkin's ability to drive mitophagy, whereas reducing USP30 activity enhances mitochondrial degradation in neurons. Global ubiquitination site profiling identified multiple mitochondrial substrates oppositely regulated by parkin and USP30. Knockdown of USP30 rescues the defective mitophagy caused by pathogenic mutations in parkin and improves mitochondrial integrity in parkin-or PINK1-deficient flies. Knockdown of USP30 in dopaminergic neurons protects flies against paraquat toxicity in vivo, ameliorating defects in dopamine levels, motor function and organismal survival. Thus USP30 inhibition is potentially beneficial for Parkinson's disease by promoting mitochondrial clearance and quality control.","[Bingol, Baris; Tea, Joy S.; Sheng, Morgan] Genentech Inc, Dept Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Phu, Lilian; Kirkpatrick, Donald S.] Genentech Inc, Dept Prot Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Reichelt, Mike; Foreman, Oded] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Bakalarski, Corey E.] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Song, Qinghua] Genentech Inc, Dept Nonclin Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Bingol, B (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",bingol.baris@gene.com,,"Bakalarski, Corey/0000-0003-1085-7828; Kirkpatrick, Donald/0000-0003-3091-2804",,,,41,169,177,4,73,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jun,2014,510,7505,,,,,370,+,,10.1038/nature13418,,27,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AJ0NG,WOS:000337350200029,24896179,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The magnetic interaction between two electronic spins can therefore impose a change in their orientation. Similar dipolar magnetic interactions exist between other spin systems and have been studied experimentally. Examples include the interaction between an electron and its nucleus and the interaction between several multi-electron spin complexes(1-5). The challenge in observing such interactions for two electrons is twofold. First, at the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, it is often dominated by the much larger Coulomb exchange counterpart(1). Second, on scales that are substantially larger than the atomic, the magnetic coupling is very weak and can be well below the ambient magnetic noise. Here we report the measurement of the magnetic interaction between the two ground-state spin-1/2 valence electrons of two Sr-88(+) ions, cotrapped in an electric Paul trap. We varied the ion separation, d, between 2.18 and 2.76 micrometres and measured the electrons' weak, millihertz-scale, magnetic interaction as a function of distance, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six orders of magnitude larger than the magnetic fields the electrons apply on each other. The cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 seconds, during which spin entanglement was generated, as verified by a negative measured value of -0.16 for the swap entanglement witness. The sensitivity necessary for this measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a decoherence-free subspace that is immune to collective magnetic field noise. Our measurements show a d(-3.0(4)) distance dependence for the coupling, consistent with the inverse-cube law.","[Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Navon, Nir; Glickman, Yinnon; Ozeri, Roee] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Kotler, S (reprint author), NIST, Phys Measurement Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",shlomi.kotler@weizmann.ac.il,"Kotler, Shlomi/I-4393-2014","Kotler, Shlomi/0000-0002-0191-5777",Israeli Science Foundation; Crown Photonics Center; German-Israeli Science Foundation,"We thank J.

Particular interest has focused on thermodynamic response functions that can be described using a normal component and an anomalous component that seems to diverge at about 228 kelvin (refs 1-3). This has prompted debate about conflicting theories(4-12) that aim to explain many of the anomalous thermodynamic properties of water. One popular theory attributes the divergence to a phase transition between two forms of liquid water occurring in the 'no man's land' that lies below the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature (T-H) at approximately 232 kelvin(13) and above about 160 kelvin(14), and where rapid ice crystallization has prevented any measurements of the bulk liquid phase. In fact, the reliable determination of the structure of liquid water typically requires temperatures above about 250 kelvin(2,15). Water crystallization has been inhibited by using nanoconfinement(16), nanodroplets(17) and association with biomolecules(16) to give liquid samples at temperatures below T-H, but such measurements rely on nanoscopic volumes of water where the interaction with the confining surfaces makes the relevance to bulk water unclear(18). Here we demonstrate that femtosecond X-ray laser pulses can be used to probe the structure of liquid water in micrometre-sized droplets that have been evaporatively cooled(19-21) below TH. We find experimental evidence for the existence of metastable bulk liquid water down to temperatures of 227(-1)(+2) kelvin in the previously largely unexplored no man's land. We observe a continuous and accelerating increase in structural ordering on supercooling to approximately 229 kelvin, where the number of droplets containing ice crystals increases rapidly. But a few droplets remain liquid for about a millisecond even at this temperature. The hope now is that these observations and our detailed structural data will help identify those theories that best describe and explain the behaviour of water.","[Sellberg, J. A.; McQueen, T.

Many experimental(4-8), theoretical(9-11) and computational(12,13) studies have sought to understand the molecular origin and implications of this anomalous behaviour. Of the different theoretical scenarios(9,14,15) put forward, one posits the existence of a first-order phase transition that involves two forms of liquid water and terminates at a critical point located at deeply supercooled conditions(9,12). Some experimental evidence is consistent with this hypothesis(4,16), but no definitive proof of a liquid-liquid transition in water has been obtained to date: rapid ice crystallization has so far prevented decisive measurements on deeply supercooled water, although this challenge has been overcome recently(16). Computer simulations are therefore crucial for exploring water's structure and behaviour in this regime, and have shown(13,17-21) that some water models exhibit liquid-liquid transitions and others do not. However, recent work(22,23) has argued that the liquid-liquid transition has been mistakenly interpreted, and is in fact a liquid-crystal transition in all atomistic models of water. Here we show, by studying the liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water(24) with the use of six advanced sampling methods to compute the free-energy surface, that two metastable liquid phases and a stable crystal phase exist at the same deeply supercooled thermodynamic condition, and that the transition between the two liquids satisfies the thermodynamic criteria of a first-order transition(25). We follow the rearrangement of water's coordination shell and topological ring structure along a thermodynamically reversible path from the low-density liquid to cubic ice(26). We also show that the system fluctuates freely between the two liquid phases rather than crystallizing. These findings provide unambiguous evidence for a liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water, and point to the separation of time scales between crystallization and relaxation as being crucial for enabling it.","[Palmer, Jeremy C.; Liu, Yang; Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.; Debenedetti, Pablo G.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Martelli, Fausto; Car, Roberto] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Debenedetti, PG (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",pdebene@princeton.edu,"Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios/K-2955-2014","Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios/0000-0002-8152-6615; Martelli, Fausto/0000-0002-5350-8225","National Science Foundation [CHE 1213343]; US Department of Energy [DE-SC0002128, DE-SC0008626]","Computations were performed at the Terascale Infrastructure for Groundbreaking Research in Engineering and Science (TIGRESS) facility at Princeton University.

In Cascadia, slow slip is segmented along strike(3) and tremor data show a gradation from large, infrequent slip episodes to small, frequent slip events with increasing depth of the plate interface(4). Observations(5-7) and models(8,9) of slow slip and tremor require the presence of near-lithostatic pore-fluid pressures in slow-earthquake source regions; however, direct evidence of factors controlling the variability in recurrence times is elusive. Here we compile seismic data from subduction zone forearcs exhibiting recurring slow earthquakes and show that the average ratio of compressional (P)-wave velocity to shear (S)-wave velocity (v(P)/v(S)) of the overlying forearc crust ranges between 1.6 and 2.0 and is linearly related to the average recurrence time of slow earthquakes. In northern Cascadia, forearc v(P)/v(S) values decrease with increasing depth of the plate interface and with decreasing tremor-episode recurrence intervals. Low v(P)/v(S) values require a large addition of quartz in a mostly mafic forearc environment(10,11). We propose that silica enrichment varying from 5 per cent to 15 per cent by volume from slab-derived fluids and upward mineralization in quartz veins(12) can explain the range of observed v(P)/v(S) values as well as the downdip decrease in v(P)/v(S). The solubility of silica depends on temperature(13), and deposition prevails near the base of the forearc crust(11). We further propose that the strong temperature dependence of healing and permeability reduction in silica-rich fault gouge via dissolution-precipitation creep(14) can explain the reduction in tremor recurrence time with progressive silica enrichment. Lower gouge permeability at higher temperatures leads to faster fluid overpressure development and low effective fault-normal stress, and therefore shorter recurrence times. Our results also agree with numerical models of slip stabilization under fault zone dilatancy strengthening(15) caused by decreasing fluid pressure as pore space increases. This implies that temperature-dependent silica deposition, permeability reduction and fluid overpressure development control dilatancy and slow-earthquake behaviour.","[Audet, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Audet, P (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",pascal.audet@uottawa.ca,,,"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (Canada); Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science (University of California, Berkeley)","Data used in this study come from the Japan Meteorological Agency, New Zealand National Seismograph Network, and the Tectonic Observatory (Caltech).

Although quiescence serves an essential role in preserving stem cell function until the stem cell is needed in tissue homeostasis or repair, defects in quiescence can lead to an impairment in tissue function(2). The extent to which stem cells can regulate quiescence is unknown. Here we show that the stem cell quiescent state is composed of two distinct functional phases, G(0) and an 'alert' phase we term G(Alert). Stem cells actively and reversibly transition between these phases in response to injury-induced systemic signals. Using genetic mouse models specific to muscle stem cells (or satellite cells), we show that mTORC1 activity is necessary and sufficient for the transition of satellite cells from G(0) into G(Alert) and that signalling through the HGF receptor cMet is also necessary. We also identify G(0)-to-G(Alert) transitions in several populations of quiescent stem cells. Quiescent stem cells that transition into GAlert possess enhanced tissue regenerative function. We propose that the transition of quiescent stem cells into G(Alert) functions as an 'alerting' mechanism, an adaptive response that positions stem cells to respond rapidly under conditions of injury and stress, priming them for cell cycle entry.","[Rodgers, Joseph T.; Brett, Jamie O.; Cromie, Melinda J.; Charville, Gregory W.; Maguire, Katie K.; Brunson, Christopher; Mastey, Namrata; Liu, Ling; Rando, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Paul F Glenn Labs Biol Aging, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rodgers, Joseph T.; Brett, Jamie O.; Cromie, Melinda J.; Charville, Gregory W.; Maguire, Katie K.; Brunson, Christopher; Mastey, Namrata; Liu, Ling; Rando, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [King, Katherine Y.; Tsai, Chang-Ru; Goodell, Margaret A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [King, Katherine Y.; Tsai, Chang-Ru; Goodell, Margaret A.] Baylor Coll Med, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rando, Thomas A.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Neurol Serv, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Rando, Thomas A.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Rehabil Res & Dev Ctr Excellence, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Rando, TA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Paul F Glenn Labs Biol Aging, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rando@stanford.edu,,,"Glenn Foundation for Medical Research; Department of Veterans Affairs; National Institutes of Health [K99 AG041764, K08 HL098898, R01 DK092883, P01 AG036695, R01 AG23806, R01 AR062185]","We would like to thank members of the Rando laboratory for discussions critical to the preparation of this manuscript, especially T.

Compared with ad libitum feeding, dietary restriction consistently extends lifespan and delays age-related diseases in evolutionarily diverse organisms(1,2). Similar conditions of nutrient limitation and genetic or pharmacological perturbations of nutrient or energy metabolism also have longevity benefits(3,4). Recently, several metabolites have been identified that modulate ageing(5,6); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this are largely undefined. Here we show that alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, extends the lifespan of adult Caenorhabditis elegans. ATP synthase subunit beta is identified as a novel binding protein of alpha-KG using a small-molecule target identification strategy termed drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS)(7). The ATP synthase, also known as complex V of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, is the main cellular energy generating machinery and is highly conserved throughout evolution(8,9). Although complete loss of mitochondrial function is detrimental, partial suppression of the electron transport chain has been shown to extend C. elegans lifespan(10-13). We show that alpha-KG inhibits ATP synthase and, similar to ATP synthase knockdown, inhibition by alpha-KG leads to reduced ATP content, decreased oxygen consumption, and increased autophagy in both C. elegans and mammalian cells. We provide evidence that the lifespan increase by alpha-KG requires ATP synthase subunit b and is dependent on target of rapamycin (TOR) downstream. Endogenous alpha-KG levels are increased on starvation and alpha-KG does not extend the lifespan of dietary-restricted animals, indicating that alpha-KG is a key metabolite that mediates longevity by dietary restriction. Our analyses uncover new molecular links between a common metabolite, a universal cellular energy generator and dietary restriction in the regulation of organismal lifespan, thus suggesting new strategies for the prevention and treatment of ageing and age-related diseases.","[Chin, Randall M.; Pai, Melody Y.; Clarke, Catherine F.; Teitell, Michael A.; Reue, Karen; Jung, Michael E.; Huang, Jing] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fu, Xudong; Hwang, Heejun; Diep, Simon; Lomenick, Brett; Hu, Eileen; Jung, Gwanghyun; Quach, Austin; Krall, Abby S.; Jiang, Meisheng; Braas, Daniel; Christofk, Heather R.; Huang, Jing] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Vergnes, Laurent; Reue, Karen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Deng, Gang; Clarke, Catherine F.; Jung, Michael E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Meli, Vijaykumar S.; Monsalve, Gabriela C.; Guo, Feng; Frand, Alison R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Whelan, Stephen A.; Chang, Helena R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Surg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wang, Jennifer X.; Trauger, Sunia A.] Harvard Univ, FAS Div Sci, Small Mol Mass Spectrometry Facil, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Solis, Gregory M.; Petrascheck, Michael] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fazlollahi, Farbod; Faull, Kym F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Pasarow Mass Spectrometry Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fazlollahi, Farbod; Faull, Kym F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kaweeteerawat, Chitrada; Godwin, Hilary A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Nili, Mahta; Teitell, Michael A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Saghatelian, Alan] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Braas, Daniel; Christofk, Heather R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, UCLA Metabol Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Huang, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jinghuang@mednet.ucla.edu,"Whelan, Stephen/I-9502-2012","Whelan, Stephen/0000-0002-4740-0795; Solis, Gregory/0000-0002-3347-5980","National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]; NIH [T32 GM007104, T32 GM007185, T32 GM008496, T32 CA009120]; China Scholarship Council Scholarship; Ford Foundation; National Science Foundation","We thank S.

PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, thereby opposing the activity of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases that mediate growth-and survival-factor signalling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effectors such as AKT and mTOR(2). To determine whether continued PTEN inactivation is required to maintain malignancy, here we generate anRNA interference-based transgenic mouse model that allows tetracycline-dependent regulation of PTEN in a time-and tissue-specific manner. Postnatal Pten knockdown in the haematopoietic compartment produced highly disseminated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Notably, reactivation of PTEN mainly reduced T-cell leukaemia dissemination but had little effect on tumour load in haematopoietic organs. Leukaemia infiltration into the intestine was dependent on CCR9G-protein-coupled receptor signalling, which was amplified by PTEN loss. Our results suggest that in the absence of PTEN, G-protein-coupled receptors may have an unanticipated role in driving tumour growth and invasion in an unsupportive environment. They further reveal that the role of PTEN loss in tumour maintenance is not invariant and can be influenced by the tissue microenvironment, thereby producing a form of intratumoral heterogeneity that is independent of cancer genotype.","[Miething, Cornelius; Bosbach, Benedikt; Appelmann, Iris; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Lowe, Scott W.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Miething, Cornelius; Scuoppo, Claudio; Appelmann, Iris; Lintault, Laura; Premsrirut, Prem K.; Hicks, James; Lowe, Scott W.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Nakitandwe, Joy; Ma, Jing; Wu, Gang; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lintault, Laura; Lowe, Scott W.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Auer, Martina; Speicher, Michael R.] Med Univ Graz, Inst Human Genet, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Benveniste, Helene] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anesthesiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Benveniste, Helene] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Radiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Lowe, SW (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA.",lowes@mskcc.org,"Speicher, Michael/B-5362-2013; Miething, Cornelius/F-9498-2014","Speicher, Michael/0000-0003-0105-955X; Miething, Cornelius/0000-0003-4699-3805","DFG [Mi1210/1-1]; Deutsche Krebshilfe (DKH) [109902]; Angel Foundation; National Cancer Institute, a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Specialized Center of Research; Don Monti Foundation; Geoffrey Beene Foundation","We are grateful to J.

The 3' untranslated region (UTR) truncation of growth-promoting mRNA transcripts that relieves intrinsic microRNA-and AU-rich-element-mediated repression has been observed to correlate with cellular transformation(3); however, the importance to tumorigenicity of RNA 3'-end-processing factors that potentially govern APA is unknown. Here we identify CFIm25 as a broad repressor of proximal poly(A) site usage that, when depleted, increases cell proliferation. Applying a regression model on standard RNA-sequencing data for novel APA events, we identified at least 1,450 genes with shortened 3'UTRs after CFIm25knockdown, representing 11% of significantly expressed mRNAs in human cells. Marked increases in the expression of several known oncogenes, including cyclin D1, are observed as a consequence of CFIm25 depletion. Importantly, we identified a subset of CFIm25-regulated APA genes with shortened 39 UTRs in glioblastoma tumours that have reduced CFIm25 expression. Downregulation of CFIm25 expression in glioblastoma cells enhances their tumorigenic properties and increases tumour size, where as CFIm25 overexpression reduces these properties and inhibits tumour growth. These findings identify a pivotal role of CFIm25 in governing APA and reveal a previously unknown connection between CFIm25 and glioblastoma tumorigenicity.","[Masamha, Chioniso P.; Albrecht, Todd R.; Shyu, Ann-Bin; Wagner, Eric J.] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Xia, Zheng; Li, Wei] Baylor Coll Med, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Div Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Xia, Zheng; Li, Wei] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yang, Jingxuan; Li, Min] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Vivian L Smith Dept Neurosurg, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Wagner, EJ (reprint author), Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Ann-Bin.Shyu@uth.tmc.edu; WL1@bcm.edu; Eric.J.Wagner@uth.tmc.edu,"Xia, Zheng/F-6561-2014; Yang, Jingxuan/K-5047-2015","Xia, Zheng/0000-0003-3364-8324; Yang, Jingxuan/0000-0003-3265-161X","CPRIT [RP100107, RP110471-C3]; Department of Defense [W81XWH-11-1-0304, W81XWH-10-1-0501]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM046454, CA167752, CA166274]; Houston Endowment; NIH [R01HG007538]; Dr Marnie Rose Foundation; William and Ella Owens Medical Research Foundation; Department of Defense Postdoctoral Visionary Award [W81XWH-12-1-0218]","We would like to thank members of the E.J.W., A.-B.S. and W.

The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying amachine-learning-based approach to 16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from monthly faecal samples obtained from birth onwards in a cohort of children living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a 'relative microbiota maturity index' and 'microbiotafor- age Z-score' that compare postnatal assembly (defined here as maturation) of a child's faecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors, including diarrhoea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.","[Subramanian, Sathish; Yatsunenko, Tanya; Benezra, Amber; DeStefano, Joseph; Meier, Martin F.; Muegge, Brian D.; Barratt, Michael J.; VanArendonk, Laura G.; Gordon, Jeffrey I.] Washington Univ, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Huq, Sayeeda; Haque, Rashidul; Mahfuz, Mustafa; Alam, Mohammed A.; Ahmed, Tahmeed] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Ctr Nutr & Food Secur, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Benezra, Amber] New Sch Social Res, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Zhang, Qunyuan; Province, Michael A.] Washington Univ, Div Stat Genom, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Petri, William A., Jr.] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Petri, William A., Jr.] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Pathol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Gordon, JI (reprint author), Washington Univ, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",jgordon@wustl.edu,"Mahfuz, Mustafa/H-5923-2017","Mahfuz, Mustafa/0000-0002-4090-785X",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; International Atomic Energy Agency; NIH [AI043596]; SBE Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (NSF) [SES-1027035],"We thank the parents and children from Dhaka, Bangladesh for their participation in this study, J.

Recently, 2OG-dependent oxygenases that catalyse hydroxylation of transferRNA(5-7) and ribosomal proteins(8) have been shown to be important in translation relating to cellular growth, T(H)17-cell differentiation and translational accuracy(9-12). The finding that ribosomal oxygenases (ROXs) occur in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans(8) raises questions as to their structural and evolutionary relationships. In Escherichia coli, YcfD catalyses arginine hydroxylation in the ribosomal protein L16; in humans, MYC-induced nuclear antigen (MINA53; also known as MINA) and nucleolar protein 66 (NO66) catalyse histidine hydroxylation in the ribosomal proteins RPL27A and RPL8, respectively. The functional assignments of ROXs open therapeutic possibilities via either ROX inhibition or targeting of differentially modified ribosomes. Despite differences in the residue and protein selectivities of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ROXs, comparison of the crystal structures of E. coli YcfD and Rhodothermus marinus YcfD with those of human MINA53 and NO66 reveals highly conserved folds and novel dimerization modes defining a new structural subfamily of 2OG-dependent oxygenases. ROX structures with and without their substrates support their functional assignments as hydroxylases but not demethylases, and reveal how the subfamily has evolved to catalyse the hydroxylation of different residue side chains of ribosomal proteins. Comparison of ROX crystal structures with those of other JmjC-domain-containing hydroxylases, including the hypoxia-inducible factor asparaginyl hydroxylase FIH and histone N-epsilon -methyl lysine demethylases, identifies branch points in 2OG-dependent oxygenase evolution and distinguishes between JmjC-containing hydroxylases and demethylases catalysing modifications of translational and transcriptional machinery. The structures reveal that new protein hydroxylation activities can evolve by changing the coordination position from which the iron-bound substrate-oxidizing species reacts. This coordination flexibility has probably contributed to the evolution of the wide range of reactions catalysed by oxygenases.","[Chowdhury, Rasheduzzaman; Sekirnik, Rok; Ho, Chia-hua; Clifton, Ian J.; Ge, Wei; Kershaw, Nadia J.; McDonough, Michael A.; Schofield, Christopher J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; [Chowdhury, Rasheduzzaman; Sekirnik, Rok; Ho, Chia-hua; Clifton, Ian J.; Ge, Wei; Kershaw, Nadia J.; McDonough, Michael A.; Schofield, Christopher J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3TA, England; [Brissett, Nigel C.; Doherty, Aidan J.] Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England; [Krojer, Tobias; Ng, Stanley S.; Muniz, Joao R.

Yet how the sulphur atom is incorporated into many sulphur-containing secondary metabolites is poorly understood. For bond formation between carbon and sulphur in primary metabolites, the major ionic sulphur sources are the persulphide and thiocarboxylate groups on sulphur-carrier (donor) proteins(3,4). Each group is post-translationally generated through the action of a specific activating enzyme. In all reported bacterial cases, the gene encoding the enzyme that catalyses the carbon-sulphur bond formation reaction and that encoding the cognate sulphur-carrier protein exist in the same gene cluster(5). To study the production of the 2-thiosugar moiety in BE-7585A, an antibiotic from Amycolatopsis orientalis, we identified a putative 2-thioglucose synthase, BexX, whose protein sequence and mode of action seem similar to those of ThiG, the enzyme that catalyses thiazole formation in thiamine biosynthesis(6,7). However, no gene encoding a sulphur-carrier protein could be located in the BE-7585A cluster. Subsequent genome sequencing uncovered a few genes encoding sulphur-carrier proteins that are probably involved in the biosynthesis of primary metabolites but only one activating enzyme gene in the A. orientalis genome. Further experiments showed that this activating enzyme can adenylate each of these sulphur carrier proteins and probably also catalyses the subsequent thiolation, through its rhodanese domain. A proper combination of these sulphur-delivery systems is effective for BexX-catalysed2-thioglucose production. The ability of BexX to selectively distinguish sulphur-carrier proteins is given a structural basis using X-ray crystallography. This study is, to our knowledge, the first complete characterization of thiosugar formation in nature and also demonstrates the receptor promiscuity of the A. orientalis sulphur-delivery system. Our results also show that co-opting the sulphur-delivery machinery of primary metabolism for the biosynthesis of sulphur-containing natural products is probably a general strategy found in nature.","[Sasaki, Eita; Liu, Hung-wen] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Zhang, Xuan; Ealick, Steven E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sun, He G.; Liu, Hung-wen] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Div Med Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Lu, Mei-Yeh Jade; Li, Jeng-yi; Chen, Yu-hsiang] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lu, Mei-Yeh Jade; Liu, Tsung-lin; Ou, Albert] Acad Sinica, Genom Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Liu, Tsung-lin] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Bioinformat & Biosignal Transduct, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Liu, HW (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",h.w.liu@mail.utexas.edu,,,"Academia Sinica; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM035906, DK67081]; Welch Foundation [F-1511]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIH [GM103403]","We thank C.-H.

Observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0 nu beta beta), a spontaneous transition that may occur in several candidate nuclei, would verify the Majorana nature of the neutrino and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. Recent searches carried out with Ge-76 (the GERDA experiment) and Xe-136 (the KamLAND-Zen and EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory)-200 experiments) have established the lifetime of this decay to be longer than 10(25) years, corresponding to a limit on the neutrino mass of 0.2-0.4 electronvolts. Here we report new results from EXO-200 based on a large Xe-136 exposure that represents an almost fourfold increase from our earlier published data sets. We have improved the detector resolution and revised the data analysis. The half-life sensitivity we obtain is 1.9x10(25) years, an improvement by a factor of 2.7 on previous EXO-200 results. We find no statistically significant evidence for 0 nu beta beta decay and set a half-life limit of 1.1x10(25) years at the 90 per cent confidence level. The high sensitivity holds promise for further running of the EXO-200 detector and future 0 nu beta beta decay searches with an improved Xe-based experiment, nEXO.","[Albert, J. B.; Daugherty, S.

However, its application to long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has remained elusive. Here we show that poor permissiveness to gene transfer and limited proficiency of the homology-directed DNA repair pathway constrain gene targeting in human HSCs. By tailoring delivery platforms and culture conditions we overcame these barriers and provide stringent evidence of targeted integration in human HSCs by long-term multilineage repopulation of transplanted mice. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our strategy by targeting a corrective complementary DNA into the IL2RG gene of HSCs from healthy donors and a subject with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1). Gene-edited HSCs sustained normal haematopoiesis and gave rise to functional lymphoid cells that possess a selective growth advantage over those carrying disruptive IL2RG mutations.

How cells control DSBs to balance between beneficial and deleterious outcomes is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that DSB control involves a network of intersecting negative regulatory circuits. Using multiple complementary methods, we show that DSBs form in greater numbers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking ZMM proteins, a suite of recombination-promoting factors traditionally regarded as acting strictly downstream of DSB formation. ZMM-dependent DSB control is genetically distinct from a pathway tying break formation to meiotic progression through the Ndt80 transcription factor. These counterintuitive findings suggest that homologous chromosomes that have successfully engaged one another stop making breaks. Genome-wide DSB maps uncover distinct responses by different subchromosomal domains to the ZMM mutation zip3 (also known as cst9), and show that Zip3 is required for the previously unexplained tendency of DSB density to vary with chromosome size. Thus, feedback tied to ZMM function contributes in unexpected ways to spatial patterning of recombination.","[Thacker, Drew; Mohibullah, Neeman; Zhu, Xuan; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Mol Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Thacker, Drew; Zhu, Xuan; Keeney, Scott] Cornell Univ, Weill Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mohibullah, Neeman; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Keeney, S (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Mol Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",s-keeney@ski.mskcc.org,,"Keeney, Scott/0000-0002-1283-6417",National Institutes of Health [R01 GM058673],"We are grateful to S.

Previous searches for carbon monoxide (CO), a tracer of molecular gas, in burst host galaxies did not detect any emission(2-4). Molecules have been detected as absorption in the spectra of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and the molecular gas is similar to the translucent or diffuse molecular clouds of the Milky Way(5,6). Absorption lines probe the interstellar medium only along the line of sight, so it is not clear whether the molecular gas represents the general properties of the regions where the bursts occur. Here we report spatially resolved observations of CO line emission and millimetre-wavelength continuum emission in two galaxies hosting gamma-ray bursts. The bursts happened in regions rich in dust, but not particularly rich in molecular gas. The ratio of molecular gas to dust (<9-14) is significantly lower than in star-forming regions of the Milky Way and nearby star-forming galaxies, suggesting that much of the dense gas where stars form has been dissipated by other massive stars.","[Hatsukade, B.; Nakanishi, K.; Hashimoto, T.] Natl Astron Observ Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Ohta, K.] Kyoto Univ, Dept Astron, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Endo, A.] Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst NanoSci, Fac Sci Appl, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; [Nakanishi, K.] Joint ALMA Observ, Santiago 7630355, Chile; [Nakanishi, K.] Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Tamura, Y.; Kohno, K.] Univ Tokyo, Inst Astron, Mitaka, Tokyo 1810015, Japan; [Kohno, K.] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Early Universe, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Hatsukade, B (reprint author), Natl Astron Observ Japan, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan.",bunyo.hatsukade@nao.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [24540230, 25103503]; NWO (Veni grant) [639.041.023]","We acknowledge A.

Simultaneous improvement of the hardness and thermal stability of diamond has long been desirable. According to the Hall-Petch effect(1,2), the hardness of diamond can be enhanced by nanostructuring (by means of nanograined and nanotwinned microstructures), as shown in previous studies(3-7). However, for well-sintered nanograined diamonds, the grain sizes are technically limited to 10-30 nm (ref. 3), with degraded thermal stability(4) compared with that of natural diamond. Recent success in synthesizing nanotwinned cubic boron nitride (nt-cBN) with a twin thickness down to similar to 3.8 nm makes it feasible to simultaneously achieve smaller nanosize, ultrahardness and superior thermal stability(5). At present, nanotwinned diamond (nt-diamond) has not been fabricated successfully through direct conversions of various carbon precursors(3,6,7) (such as graphite, amorphous carbon, glassy carbon and C-60). Here we report the direct synthesis of nt-diamond with an average twin thickness of similar to 5 nm, using a precursor of onion carbon nanoparticles at high pressure and high temperature, and the observation of a new monoclinic crystalline form of diamond coexisting with nt-diamond. The pure synthetic bulk nt-diamond material shows unprecedented hardness and thermal stability, with Vickers hardness up to similar to 200 GPa and an in-air oxidization temperature more than 200 degrees C higher than that of natural diamond. The creation of nanotwinned microstructures offers a general pathway for manufacturing new advanced carbon-based materials with exceptional thermal stability and mechanical properties.","[Huang, Quan; Yu, Dongli; Xu, Bo; Hu, Wentao; Zhao, Zhisheng; Wen, Bin; He, Julong; Liu, Zhongyuan; Tian, Yongjun] Yanshan Univ, State Key Lab Metastable Mat Sci & Technol, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanming] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanbin] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60439 USA","Tian, YJ (reprint author), Yanshan Univ, State Key Lab Metastable Mat Sci & Technol, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China.",fhcl@ysu.edu.cn,"Zhao, Zhisheng/G-8199-2015; Ma, Yanming/A-7297-2008; Ma, Yanming/A-4982-2009; Tian, Yongjun/A-1693-2010; Xu, Bo/C-6925-2008","Zhao, Zhisheng/0000-0001-8492-0151; Ma, Yanming/0000-0003-3711-0011; Xu, Bo/0000-0002-9804-1614; Wang, Yanbin/0000-0001-5716-3183; Liu, Zhongyuan/0000-0002-5600-8998","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51121061, 51332005, 51172197, 11025418, 91022029]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011CB808205, 2010CB731605]; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0968456]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51121061), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2011CB808205 and 2010CB731605), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51332005, 51172197, 11025418 and 91022029) and the US National Science Foundation (EAR-0968456).",,30,138,144,42,356,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,12-Jun,2014,510,7504,,,,,250,+,,10.1038/nature13381,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AI7AT,WOS:000337032400046,24919919,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In its positive phase, sea surface temperatures are lower than normal off the Sumatra-Java coast, but higher in the western tropical Indian Ocean. During the extreme positive-IOD (pIOD) events of 1961, 1994 and 1997, the eastern cooling strengthened and extended westward along the equatorial Indian Ocean through strong reversal of both the mean westerly winds and the associated eastward-flowing upper ocean currents(1,2). This created anomalously dry conditions from the eastern to the central Indian Ocean along the Equator and atmospheric convergence farther west, leading to catastrophic floods in eastern tropical African countries(13,14) but devastating droughts in eastern Indian Ocean rim countries(8-10,16,17). Despite these serious consequences, the response of pIOD events to greenhouse warming is unknown. Here, using an ensemble of climate models forced by a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), we project that the frequency of extreme pIOD events will increase by almost a factor of three, from one event every 17.3 years over the twentieth century to one event every 6.3 years over the twenty-first century. We find that a mean state change-with weakening of both equatorial westerly winds and eastward oceanic currents in association with a faster warming in the western than the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean-facilitates more frequent occurrences of wind and oceanic current reversal. This leads to more frequent extreme pIOD events, suggesting an increasing frequency of extreme climate and weather events in regions affected by the pIOD.","[Cai, Wenju; Wang, Guojian; Weller, Evan] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Cai, Wenju; Wang, Guojian; Wu, Lixin] Ocean Univ China, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ashok, Karumuri] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Masumoto, Yukio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Masumoto, Yukio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Climate Variat Predictabil & Applicatabil Res Pro, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Yamagata, Toshio] JAMSTEC, Applicat Lab, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan","Cai, WJ (reprint author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",wenju.cai@csiro.au,"Yamagata, Toshio/A-1807-2009; Cai, Wenju/C-2864-2012; MASUMOTO, YUKIO/G-5021-2014; Santoso, Agus/J-7350-2012","Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124",Australian Climate Change Science Program; Goyder Institute; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader award; Australian Research Council,"W.C. and E.

However, data from experimental warming studies indicate that many species that initiate leaf growth and flowering earlier also reach seed maturation and senesce earlier, shortening their active and reproductive periods(6-10). A conceptual model to explain this apparent contradiction(11), and an analysis of the effect of elevated CO2-which can delay annual life cycle events(12-14)-on changing season length, have not been tested. Here we show that experimental warming in a temperate grassland led to a longer growing season through earlier leaf emergence by the first species to leaf, often a grass, and constant or delayed senescence by other species that were the last to senesce, supporting the conceptual model. Elevated CO2 further extended growing, but not reproductive, season length in the warmed grassland by conserving water, which enabled most species to remain active longer. Our results suggest that a longer growing season, especially in years or biomes where water is a limiting factor, is not due to warming alone, but also to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations that extend the active period of plant annual life cycles.","[Reyes-Fox, Melissa] ARS, USDA, Soil Plant Nutrient Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Reyes-Fox, Melissa; McMaster, Gregory S.] Northern Plains Area, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Steltzer, Heidi] Ft Lewis Coll, Dept Biol, Durango, CO 81301 USA; [Trlica, M.

These observations suggest that the fundamental relationship between motor cortex activity and movement may not be fixed but is instead shaped by learning; however, to what extent and how motor learning shapes this relationship are not fully understood. Here we addressed this issue by using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging(11) to monitor the activity of the same population of hundreds of layer 2/3 neurons while mice learned a forelimb lever-press task over two weeks. Excitatory and inhibitory neurons were identified by transgenic labelling(12,13). Inhibitory neuron activity was relatively stable and balanced local excitatory neuron activity on a movement-by-movement basis, whereas excitatory neuron activity showed higher dynamism during the initial phase of learning. The dynamics of excitatory neurons during the initial phase involved the expansion of the movement-related population which explored various activity patterns even during similar movements. This was followed by a refinement into a smaller population exhibiting reproducible spatiotemporal sequences of activity. This pattern of activity associated with the learned movement was unique to expert animals and not observed during similar movements made during the naive phase, and the relationship between neuronal activity and individual movements became more consistent with learning. These changes in population activity coincided with a transient increase in dendritic spine turnover in these neurons. Our results indicate that a novel and reproducible activity-movement relationship develops as a result of motor learning, and we speculate that synaptic plasticity within the motor cortex underlies the emergence of reproducible spatiotemporal activity patterns for learned movements. These results underscore the profound influence of learning on the way that the cortex produces movements.","[Peters, Andrew J.; Chen, Simon X.; Komiyama, Takaki] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Peters, Andrew J.; Chen, Simon X.; Komiyama, Takaki] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Komiyama, Takaki] Univ Calif San Diego, PRESTO, JST, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Komiyama, T (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",tkomiyama@ucsd.edu,,"Peters, Andrew/0000-0001-9351-1456",Japan Science and Technology Agency (PRESTO); Pew Charitable Trusts; Alfred P.

A consequence of longevity is exposure to stress stimuli including reactive oxygen species (ROS), nutrient fluctuation and DNA damage(1,2). Damage that occurs within stressed HSCs must be tightly controlled to prevent either loss of function or the clonal persistence of oncogenic mutations that increase the risk of leukaemogenesis(3,4). Despite the importance of maintaining cell integrity throughout life, how the HSC pool achieves this and how individual HSCs respond to stress remain poorly understood. Many sources of stress cause misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) enables the cell to either resolve stress or initiate apoptosis(5,6). Here we show that human HSCs are predisposed to apoptosis through strong activation of the PERK branch of the UPR after ER stress, whereas closely related progenitors exhibit an adaptive response leading to their survival. Enhanced ER protein folding by overexpression of the cochaperone ERDJ4 (also called DNAJB9) increases HSC repopulation capacity in xenograft assays, linking the UPR to HSC function. Because the UPR is a focal point where different sources of stress converge, our study provides a framework for understanding how stress signalling is coordinated within tissue hierarchies and integrated with stemness. Broadly, these findings reveal that the HSC pool maintains clonal integrity by clearance of individual HSCs after stress to prevent propagation of damaged stem cells.","[van Galen, Peter; Kreso, Antonija; Mbong, Nathan; Xie, Stephanie; Laurenti, Elisa; Hermans, Karin; Wienholds, Erno; Dick, John E.] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [van Galen, Peter; Kreso, Antonija; Mbong, Nathan; Xie, Stephanie; Laurenti, Elisa; Hermans, Karin; Wienholds, Erno; Dick, John E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Kent, David G.; Chambers, Joseph E.; Marciniak, Stefan J.; Green, Anthony R.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Wellcome Trust, MRC Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Kent, David G.; Green, Anthony R.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Fitzmaurice, Timothy; Goodall, Jane C.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Med, Sch Clin Med, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Eppert, Kolja] McGill Univ, Dept Pediat, Westmount, PQ H3Z 2Z3, Canada; [Eppert, Kolja] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Res Inst, Westmount, PQ H3Z 2Z3, Canada; [Wouters, Bradly G.] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Wouters, Bradly G.] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada","Dick, JE (reprint author), Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.",jdick@uhnresearch.ca,"Wouters, Bradly/T-1525-2017","Wouters, Bradly/0000-0002-8187-592X; Kent, David/0000-0001-7871-8811; Eppert, Kolja/0000-0001-9061-8856; Laurenti, Elisa/0000-0002-9917-9092; Marciniak, Stefan/0000-0001-8472-7183",Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Canadian Cancer Society; Terry Fox Foundation; Genome Canada through the Ontario Genomics Institute; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research; province of Ontario; Canada Research Chair; Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (OMOHLTC); Leukemia and Lymphoma Research; Cancer Research UK; Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Cambridge Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of America; Arthritis Research UK; Medical Research Council (UK); Terry Fox New Frontiers Research Program [PPG09-020005]; Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) [201592],"We thank D.

Studies of human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in small-animal models have shown favourable effects of this treatment(3-7). However, it remains unknown whether clinical-scale hESC-CM transplantation is feasible, safe or can provide sufficient myocardial regeneration. Here we show that hESC-CMs can be produced at a clinical scale (more than one billion cells per batch) and cryopreserved with good viability. Using a non-human primate model of myocardial ischaemia followed by reperfusion, we show that cryopreservation and intramyocardial delivery of one billion hESC-CMs generates extensive remuscularization of the infarctedheart. The hESC-CMs showed progressive but incomplete maturation over a 3-month period. Grafts were perfused by host vasculature, and electromechanical junctions between graft and host myocytes were present within 2 weeks of engraftment. Importantly, grafts showed regular calcium transients that were synchronized to the host electrocardiogram, indicating electromechanical coupling. In contrast to small-animal models(7), nonfatal ventricular arrhythmias were observed in hESC-CM-engrafted primates. Thus, hESC-CMs can remuscularize substantial amounts of the infarcted monkey heart. Comparable remuscularization of a human heart should be possible, but potential arrhythmic complications need to be overcome.","[Chong, James J.

Progression to CRPC after androgen ablation therapy is predominantly driven by deregulated and rogen receptor (AR) signalling(1-3). Despite the success of recently approved therapies targeting AR signalling, such as abiraterone(4-6) and second generation anti-androgens including MDV3100 (also known as enzalutamide) 7,8, durable responses are limited, presumably owing to acquired resistance. Recently, JQ1 and I-BET762 two selective small-molecule inhibitors that target the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects in a range of malignancies(9-12). Here we show that AR-signalling-competent human CRPC cell lines are preferentially sensitive to bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibition. BRD4 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of AR and can bedisrupted by JQ1(refs 11, 13). Like the direct AR antagonist MDV3100, JQ1 disrupted AR recruitment to target gene loci. By contrast with MDV3100, JQ1 functions downstream of AR, and more potently abrogated BRD4 localization to AR target loci and AR-mediated gene transcription, including induction of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and its oncogenic activity. In vivo, BET bromodomain inhibition was more efficacious than direct AR antagonism in CRPC xenograft mouse models. Taken together, these studies provide a novel epigenetic approach for the concerted blockade of oncogenic drivers in advanced prostate cancer.","[Asangani, Irfan A.; Dommeti, Vijaya L.; Wang, Xiaoju; Malik, Rohit; Cieslik, Marcin; Escara-Wilke, June; Dhanireddy, Sudheer; Engelke, Carl; Iyer, Mathew K.; Jing, Xiaojun; Wu, Yi-Mi; Cao, Xuhong; Feng, Felix Y.; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Michigan Ctr Translat Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Asangani, Irfan A.; Wang, Xiaoju; Malik, Rohit; Wu, Yi-Mi; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yang, Rendong; Qin, Zhaohui S.] Emory Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Wilder-Romans, Kari; Feng, Felix Y.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cao, Xuhong; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wang, Shaomeng] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wang, Shaomeng] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wang, Shaomeng] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wang, Shaomeng; Feng, Felix Y.; Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Comprehens Canc Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chinnaiyan, Arul M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Chinnaiyan, AM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Michigan Ctr Translat Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",arul@umich.edu,,"Qin, Zhaohui/0000-0002-1583-146X",Movember-Prostate Cancer Foundation Challenge Award; Early Detection Research Network [UO1 CA111275]; NCI Prostate SPORE [P50CA69568]; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; American Cancer Society; A.

The largely cytoplasmic KMT SMYD3 (SET and MYND domain containing protein 3) is overexpressed in numerous human tumours(2-4). However, the molecular mechanism by which SMYD3 regulates cancer pathways and its relationship to tumor-igenesisin vivo are largely unknown. Here we show that methylation of MAP3K2 by SMYD3 increases MAP kinase signalling and promotes the formation of Ras-driven carcinomas. Using mouse models for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, we found that abrogating SMYD3 catalytic activity inhibits tumour development in response to oncogenic Ras. We used protein array technology to identify the MAP3K2 kinase as a target of SMYD3. In cancer cell lines, SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 at lysine 260 potentiates activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling module and SMYD3 depletion synergizes with a MEK inhibitor to block Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Finally, the PP2A phosphatase complex, a key negative regulator of the MAP kinase pathway, binds to MAP3K2 and this interaction is blocked by methylation. Together, our results elucidate a new role for lysine methylation in integrating cytoplasmic kinase-signalling cascades and establish a pivotal role for SMYD3 in the regulation of oncogenic Ras signalling.","[Mazur, Pawel K.; Butte, Atul J.; Sage, Julien] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mazur, Pawel K.; Butte, Atul J.; Sage, Julien] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Reynoird, Nicolas; Wilkinson, Alex W.; Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Khatri, Purvesh] Stanford Univ, Inst Immun Transplantat & Infect, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Khatri, Purvesh] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jansen, Pascal W.

The nucleotide cytidine 5' triphosphate (CTP) is a precursor required for the metabolism of DNA, RNA and phospholipids(2-4). CTP originates from two sources: a salvage pathway and a de novo synthesis pathway that depends on two enzymes, the CTP synthases (or synthetases) 1 and 2 (CTPS1 with CTPS2); the respective roles of these two enzymes are not known(5-7). CTP synthase activity is a potentially important step for DNA synthesis in lymphocytes(8,9). Here we report the identification of a loss-of- function homozygous mutation (rs145092287) in CTPS1 in humans that causes a novel and life-threatening immunodeficiency, characterized by an impaired capacity of activated T and B cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated activation. In contrast, proximal and distal T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling events and responses were only weakly affected by the absence of CTPS1. Activated CTPS1-deficient cells had decreased levels of CTP. Normal T-cell proliferation was restored in CTPS1-deficient cells by expressing wild-type CTPS1 or by addition of exogenous CTP or its nucleoside precursor, cytidine. CTPS1 expression was found to be low in resting T cells, but rapidly upregulated following TCR activation. These results highlight a key and specific role of CTPS1 in the immune system by its capacity to sustain the proliferation of activated lymphocytes during the immune response. CTPS1 may therefore represent a therapeutic target of immunosuppressive drugs that could specifically dampen lymphocyte activation.","[Martin, Emmanuel; Palmic, Noe; Lenoir, Christelle; Hauck, Fabian; Fischer, Alain; Latour, Sylvain] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Lab Activat Lymphocytaire & Susceptibilite EBV, INSERM, UMR 1163, F-75015 Paris, France; [Martin, Emmanuel; Palmic, Noe; Lenoir, Christelle; Hauck, Fabian; Fabrega, Sylvie; Nitschke, Patrick; Picard, Capucine; Fischer, Alain; Latour, Sylvain] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Imagine, F-75015 Paris, France; [Sanquer, Sylvia; Latour, Sylvain] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Lab Biochim Metabol & Proteom, F-75015 Paris, France; [Mongellaz, Cedric; Taylor, Naomi] Inst Genet Mol Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 5535, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Fabrega, Sylvie] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Plateforme Vecteurs Viraux & Transfert Genes, IFR94, F-75015 Paris, France; [Nitschke, Patrick] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Serv Bioinformat, F-75015 Paris, France; [Degli Esposti, Mauro; Wynn, Robert F.; Arkwright, Peter D.] Univ Manchester, Royal Manchester Childrens Hosp, Manchester M13 0WL, Lancs, England; [Degli Esposti, Mauro] Italian Inst Technol, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Majewski, Jacek; Jabado, Nada] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G1, Canada; [Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Majewski, Jacek; Jabado, Nada] Genome Quebec Innovat Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G1, Canada; [Jabado, Nada] McGill Univ, Hlth Ctr Res Inst, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; [Picard, Capucine] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, AP HP, Ctr Etude Deficits Immunitaires, F-75015 Paris, France; [Picard, Capucine] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, INSERM, Lab Genet Humaine Malad Infect, UMR 1163, F-75015 Paris, France; [Fischer, Alain] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, AP HP, Unite Immunol & Hematol Pediat, F-75015 Paris, France; [Fischer, Alain] Coll France, F-75005 Paris, France","Latour, S (reprint author), Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Lab Activat Lymphocytaire & Susceptibilite EBV, INSERM, UMR 1163, F-75015 Paris, France.",sylvain.latour@inserm.fr,"Taylor, Naomi/H-4016-2014; Martin, Emmanuel/F-9743-2016; Hauck, Fabian/H-5556-2016; Picard, Capucine/H-3914-2017","Martin, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4211-7373; Picard, Capucine/0000-0001-8788-5056; Degli Esposti, Mauro/0000-0002-0977-119X; Wynn, robert/0000-0002-6046-8428; Schwartzentruber, Jeremy/0000-0002-6183-2092; Arkwright, Peter/0000-0002-7411-5375; Latour, Sylvain/0000-0001-8238-4391","INSERM; ANR [ANR-08-MIEN-012-01, ANR-2010-MIDI-005-02, ANR-10-IAHU-01]; Fondation ARC (France); European Research Council [ERC-2009-AdG_20090506, FP7-249816]; Rare Diseases Fondation (France); ANR (France); Ligue contre le cancer (France); Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council [WT095219MA, G1001799]","The authors thank the patients, their families and the healthy donors for cooperation.

In eukaryotes, the physical coupling between helicase and DNA polymerases remains poorly understood. Here we define the molecular mechanism by which the yeast Ctf4 protein links the Cdc45-MCM-GINS(CMG) DNA helicase to DNA polymerase alpha (Pol alpha) within the replisome. We use X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to show that Ctf4 self-associates in a constitutive disk-shaped trimer. Trimerization depends on a beta-propeller domain in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein, which is fused to a helical extension that protrudes from one face of the trimeric disk. Critically, Pol alpha and the CMG helicase share a common mechanism of interaction with Ctf4. We show that the amino-terminal tails of the catalytic subunit of Pol alpha and the Sld5 subunit of GINS contain a conserved Ctf4-binding motif that docks onto the exposed helical extension of a Ctf4 protomer within the trimer. Accordingly, we demonstrate that one Ctf4 trimer can support binding of up to three partner proteins, including the simultaneous association with both Pol a and GINS. Our findings indicate that Ctf4 can couple two molecules of Pol alpha to one CMG helicase within the replisome, providing a new model for lagging-strand synthesis in eukaryotes that resembles the emerging model for the simpler replisome of Escherichia coli(5-8). The ability of Ctf4 to act as a platform for multivalent interactions illustrates a mechanism for the concurrent recruitment of factors that act together at the fork.","[Simon, Aline C.; Perera, Rajika L.; Ivanova, Marina E.; Kilkenny, Mairi L.; Pellegrini, Luca] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Zhou, Jin C.; Renault, Ludovic; Costa, Alessandro] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, London EN6 3LD, England; [van Deursen, Frederick] Univ Manchester, Canc Res UK Manchester Inst, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Evrin, Cecile; Labib, Karim] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, MRC Prot Phosphorylat & Ubiquitylat Unit, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland; [Kjaer, Svend] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Matak-Vinkovic, Dijana] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Pellegrini, L (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",alessandro.costa@cancer.org.uk; lp212@cam.ac.uk,,"Kjaer, Susanne/0000-0002-8347-1398",Gates Cambridge PhD program; CRUK; MRC; Wellcome Trust SRF award in basic biomedical science,"We would like to thank L.

For chemical work, there is an equally important role for NADPH, which powers redox defence and reductive biosynthesis(1). The most direct route to produce NADPH from glucose is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, with malic enzyme sometimes also important(2,3). Although the relative contribution of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to ATP production has been extensively analysed, similar analysis of NADPH metabolism has been lacking. Here we demonstrate the ability to directly track, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the passage of deuterium from labelled substrates into NADPH, and combine this approach with carbon labelling and mathematical modelling to measure NADPH fluxes. In proliferating cells, the largest contributor to cytosolic NADPH is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Surprisingly, a nearly comparable contribution comes from serine-driven one-carbon metabolism, in which oxidation of methylene tetrahydrofolate to 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate is coupled to reduction of NADP(+) to NADPH. Moreover, tracing of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism revealed complete oxidation of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to make NADPH. As folate metabolism has not previously been considered an NADPH producer, confirmation of its functional significance was undertaken through knockdown of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) genes. Depletion of either the cytosolic or mitochondrial MTHFD isozyme resulted in decreased cellular NADPH/NADP(+) and reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios (GSH/GSSG) and increased cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. Thus, although the importance of folate metabolism for proliferating cells has been long recognized and attributed to its function of producing one-carbon units for nucleic acid synthesis, another crucial function of this pathway is generating reducing power.","[Fan, Jing; Kamphorst, Jurre J.; Shlomi, Tomer; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ye, Jiangbin; Thompson, Craig B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Shlomi, Tomer] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Rabinowitz, JD (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",joshr@genomics.princeton.edu,"Ye, Jiangbin/A-1094-2007","Kamphorst, Jurre/0000-0002-2042-5474; Ye, Jiangbin/0000-0003-1117-4869","Stand Up To Cancer; NIH [CA163591, AI097382, CA105463, CA104838, GM071508]; Hope [HFCR-11-03-01]","The iBMK parental and Akt cell lines were generously provided by E.

Proposed mechanisms implicate various lipid species, inflammatory signalling and other cellular modifications. Studies in mice and humans have elucidated a key role for hepatic diacylglycerol activation of protein kinase C epsilon in triggering hepatic insulin resistance.

In contrast to other basal metazoans, ctenophores (comb jellies) have both complex nervous and mesoderm-derived muscular systems. These holoplanktonic predators also have sophisticated ciliated locomotion, behaviour and distinct development. Here we present the draft genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, Pacific sea gooseberry, together with ten other ctenophore transcriptomes, and show that they are remarkably distinct from other animal genomes in their content of neurogenic, immune and developmental genes. Our integrative analyses place Ctenophora as the earliest lineage within Metazoa. This hypothesis is supported by comparative analysis of multiple gene families, including the apparent absence of HOX genes, canonical microRNA machinery, and reduced immune complement in ctenophores. Although two distinct nervous systems are well recognized in ctenophores, many bilaterian neuron-specific genes and genes of 'classical' neurotransmitter pathways either are absent or, if present, are not expressed in neurons. Our metabolomic and physiological data are consistent with the hypothesis that ctenophore neural systems, and possibly muscle specification, evolved independently from those in other animals.","[Moroz, Leonid L.; Citarella, Mathew R.; Dosung, Sohn; Norekian, Tigran P.; Ptitsyn, Andrey; Mukherjee, Krishanu; Moroz, Tatiana P.; Bobkova, Yelena; Bobkov, Yuri V.; Swore, Joshua J.; Girardo, David O.; Fodor, Alexander; Sanford, Rachel; Bruders, Rebecca; Kohn, Andrea B.] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Moroz, Leonid L.; Yu, Fahong] Univ Florida, Dept Neurosci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Moroz, Leonid L.; Yu, Fahong] Univ Florida, McKnight Brain Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Moroz, Leonid L.; Norekian, Tigran P.; Swore, Joshua J.; Girardo, David O.; Bruders, Rebecca; Mills, Claudia E.; Swalla, Billie J.] Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA; [Kocot, Kevin M.; Halanych, Kenneth M.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Povolotskaya, Inna S.; Derelle, Romain; Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Povolotskaya, Inna S.; Derelle, Romain; Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Grigorenko, Anastasia P.; Gusev, Fedor; Rogaev, Evgeny I.] Univ Massachusetts, Brudnick Neuropsychiat Res Inst, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01604 USA; [Grigorenko, Anastasia P.; Reshetov, Denis; Gusev, Fedor; Rogaev, Evgeny I.] RAS, Vavilov Inst Gen Genet, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Dailey, Christopher; Sweedler, Jonathan V.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dailey, Christopher; Sweedler, Jonathan V.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Berezikov, Eugene] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, European Res Inst Biol Ageing, NL-9713 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Buckley, Katherine M.; Rast, Jonathan P.] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Res Inst, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Buckley, Katherine M.; Rast, Jonathan P.] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Res Inst, Dept Immunol, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Kapitonov, Vladimir V.; Jurka, Jerzy] Genet Informat Res Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Kittler, Ellen] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Shrewsbury, MA 01545 USA; [Solovyev, Victor V.] Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Rogaev, Evgeny I.] RAS, Ctr Brain Neurobiol & Neurogenet, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Rogaev, Evgeny I.] RAS, Inst Cytol & Genet, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Rogaev, Evgeny I.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Bioengn & Bioinformat, Moscow 119991, Russia","Moroz, LL (reprint author), Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, 9505 Ocean Shore Blvd, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA.",moroz@whitney.ufl.edu; Evgeny.Rogaev@umassmed.edu; abkohn@msn.com,"Sweedler, Jonathan/A-9405-2009; Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/H-6331-2015","Sweedler, Jonathan/0000-0003-3107-9922; Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/0000-0001-8243-4694; Buckley, Katherine/0000-0002-6585-8943; Povolotskaya, Inna/0000-0001-6621-232X; Solovyev, Victor/0000-0001-8885-493X; Berezikov, Eugene/0000-0002-1145-2884; Ptitsyn, Andrey/0000-0003-1196-8757","NSF [NSF-0744649, CNS-0821622, CHE-1111705]; NIH [1R01GM097502, R01MH097062, R21RR025699, 5R21DA030118, P30 DA018310, R01 AG029360, 1S10RR027052]; NASA [NNX13AJ31G]; NSERC [458115, 211598]; University of Florida Opportunity Funds/McKnight Brain Research; Florida Biodiversity Institute; Rostock Inc.; Russian Federation Government [14.B25.31.0033, 220]; HHMI [55007424]; EMBO; MINECO [BFU2012-31329, Sev-2012-0208]; AU Marine Biology Program [117]; ICREA","We thank Friday Harbor Laboratories for facilities during animal collection and Marine Genomics apprenticeships (L.

Redundancy of miR-34/449 miRNAs and their dominant expression in multiciliated epithelia suggest a functional significance in ciliogenesis. Here we report that mice deficient for all miR-34/449 miRNAs exhibited postnatal mortality, infertility and strong respiratory dysfunction caused by defective mucociliary clearance. In both mouse and Xenopus, miR-34/449-deficient multiciliated cells (MCCs) exhibited a significant decrease in cilia length and number, due to defective basal body maturation and apical docking. The effect of miR-34/449 on ciliogenesis was mediated, at least in part, by post-transcriptional repression of Cp110, a centriolar protein suppressing cilia assembly. Consistent with this, cp110 knockdown in miR-34/449-deficient MCCs restored ciliogenesis by rescuing basal body maturation and docking. Altogether, our findings elucidate conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms through which miR-34/449 regulate motile ciliogenesis.","[Song, Rui; Sponer, Nicole; Lee, Joon Sub; Dixon, Gary; Lishko, Polina; He, Lin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Cellular & Dev Biol, MCB Dept, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Walentek, Peter; Harland, Richard] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Genet Genom & Dev, MCB Dept, Ctr Integrat Genom, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Klimke, Alexander; Kessel, Michael] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Wan, Ying] Third Mil Med Univ, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China; [Lize, Muriel] Univ Gottingen, Dept Mol Oncol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","He, L (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Cellular & Dev Biol, MCB Dept, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA.",rui.song@berkeley.edu; lhe@berkeley.edu,,"Walentek, Peter/0000-0002-2332-6068; Lize, Muriel/0000-0002-4954-3503","NCI [R01 CA139067, 1R21CA175560-01]; CIRM new faculty award [RN2-00923-1]; TRDRP research grant [21RT-0133]; American Cancer Society (ACS) [123339-RSG-12-265-01-RMC]; Siebel postdoctoral fellowship; CIRM postdoctoral fellowship; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Wa 3365/1-1]; NIH [GM42341]; Dorothea Schloezer Fellowship","We thank M.

This structure allows accurate mapping and potential mechanistic interpretation of disease-associated mutations in GLUT1. Structure-based analysis of these mutations provides an insight into the alternating access mechanism of GLUT1 and other members of the sugar porter subfamily.

Magnetic fields probably play a critical role in jet formation(2,3) and in accretion disk physics(4). A dynamically important magnetic field was recently found near the Galactic Centre black hole(5). If this is common and if the field continues to near the black hole event horizon, disk structures will be affected, invalidating assumptions made in standard models(3,6,7). Here we report that jet magnetic field and accretion disk luminosity are tightly correlated over seven orders of magnitude for a sample of 76 radio-loud active galaxies. We conclude that the jet-launching regions of these radio-loud galaxies are threaded by dynamically important fields, which will affect the disk properties. These fields obstruct gas infall, compress the accretion disk vertically, slow down the disk rotation by carrying away its angular momentum in an outflow(3) and determine the directionality of jets(8).","[Zamaninasab, M.; Clausen-Brown, E.; Savolainen, T.] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Tchekhovskoy, A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tchekhovskoy, A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tchekhovskoy, A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Theoret Astrophys Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zamaninasab, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Radioastron, Hugel 69, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",m.zamaninasab@gmail.com,,"Savolainen, Tuomas/0000-0001-6214-1085","German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG [SFB 956]; Princeton Center for Theoretical Science fellowship; NASA through the Einstein fellowship program [PF3-140115]","We thank A.

Transition metal catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool with which to convert these unreactive bonds into carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds(1-6), but the selective transformation of aliphatic C-H bonds is still a challenge. The most successful approaches involve a 'directing group', which positions the metal catalyst near a particular C-H bond, so that the C-H functionalization step occurs via cyclometallation(7). Most directed aliphatic C-H activation processes proceed through a five-membered-ring cyclometallated intermediate(8-10). Considering the number of new reactions that have arisen from such intermediates, it seems likely that identification of distinct cyclometallation pathways would lead to the development of other useful chemical transformations(11). Here we report a palladium-catalysed C-H bond activation mode that proceeds through a four-membered-ring cyclopalladation pathway. The chemistry described here leads to the selective transformation of a methyl group that is adjacent to an unprotected secondary amine into a synthetically versatile nitrogen heterocycle. The scope of this previously unknown bond disconnection is highlighted through the development of C-H amination and carbonylation processes, leading to the synthesis of aziridines and beta-lactams (respectively), and is suggestive of a generic C-H functionalization platform that could simplify the synthesis of aliphatic secondary amines, a class of small molecules that are particularly important features of many pharmaceutical agents.","[McNally, Andrew; Haffemayer, Benjamin; Collins, Beatrice S.

This sparseness limits our understanding of the dominant feedbacks between the AIS, Southern Hemisphere climate and global sea level. Marine records of iceberg-rafted debris (IBRD) provide a nearly continuous signal of ice-sheet dynamics and variability. IBRD records from the North Atlantic Ocean have been widely used to reconstruct variability in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets(5), but comparable records from the Southern Ocean of the AIS are lacking because of the low resolution and large dating uncertainties in existing sediment cores. Here we present two well-dated, high-resolution IBRD records that capture a spatially integrated signal of AIS variability during the last deglaciation. We document eight events of increased iceberg flux from various parts of the AIS between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago, in marked contrast to previous scenarios which identified the main AIS retreat as occurring after meltwater pulse 1A(3,6-8) and continuing into the late Holocene epoch. The highest IBRD flux occurred 14,600 years ago, providing the first direct evidence for an Antarctic contribution to meltwater pulse 1A. Climate model simulations with AIS freshwater forcing identify a positive feedback between poleward transport of Circumpolar Deep Water, subsurface warming and AIS melt, suggesting that small perturbations to the ice sheet can be substantially enhanced, providing a possible mechanism for rapid sea-level rise.","[Weber, M.

Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health.","[Myers, Samuel S.; Zanobetti, Antonella; Schwartz, Joel] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Myers, Samuel S.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Environm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kloog, Itai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog & Environm Dev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Huybers, Peter] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leakey, Andrew D.

A brain function that may use such interactions is declarative memory-that is, memory that can be consciously recalled, such as episodes and facts. Declarative memory is enabled by circuits in the entorhinal cortex that interface the hippocampus with the neocortex(7,8). During encoding and retrieval of declarative memories, entorhinal and hippocampal circuits are thought to interact via theta and gamma oscillations(4,6,8), which in awake rodents predominate frequency spectra in both regions(9-12). In favour of this idea, theta-gamma coupling has been observed between entorhinal cortex and hippocampus under steady-state conditions inwell-trained rats(12); however, the relationship between interregional coupling and memory formation remains poorly understood. Here we show, by multisite recording at successive stages of associative learning, that the coherence of firing patterns in directly connected entorhinal-hippocampus circuits evolves as rats learn to use an odour cue to guide navigational behaviour, and that such coherence is invariably linked to the development of ensemble representations for unique trial outcomes in each area. Entorhinal-hippocampal coupling was observed specifically in the 20-40-hertz frequency band and specifically between the distal part of hippocampal area CA1 and the lateral part of entorhinal cortex, the subfields that receive the predominant olfactory input to the hippocampal region(13). Collectively, the results identify 20-40-hertz oscillations as a mechanism for synchronizing evolving representations in dispersed neural circuits during encoding and retrieval of olfactory-spatial associative memory.","[Igarashi, Kei M.; Lu, Li; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Igarashi, Kei M.; Lu, Li; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Neural Computat, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Colgin, Laura L.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Moser, EI (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Olav Kyrres Gate 9,MTFS,7491, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",kei.igarashi@ntnu.no; edvard.moser@ntnu.no,,,"European Research Council [232608, 268598]; Kavli Foundation; Centre of Excellence scheme of the Research Council of Norway (Centre for the Biology of Memory and Centre for Neural Computation); Mishima Kaiun Memorial Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank A.

In addition to natural sources, environments are exposed to anthropogenic inputs of all these gases from oil and gas extraction and distribution. The gases provide carbon and/or energy for a diverse range of microorganisms that can metabolize them in both anoxic(3) and oxic zones. Aerobic methanotrophs, which can assimilate methane, have been considered to be entirely distinct from utilizers of short-chain alkanes, and studies of environments exposed to mixtures of methane and multi-carbon alkanes have assumed that disparate groups of microorganisms are responsible for the metabolism of these gases. Here we describe the mechanism by which a single bacterial strain, Methylocella silvestris, can use methane or propane as a carbon and energy source, documenting a methanotroph that can utilize a short-chain alkane as an alternative to methane. Furthermore, during growth on a mixture of these gases, efficient consumption of both gases occurred at the same time. Two soluble di-iron centre monooxygenase (SDIMO) gene clusters were identified and were found to be differentially expressed during bacterial growth on these gases, although both were required for efficient propane utilization. This report of a methanotroph expressing an additional SDIMO that seems to be uniquely involved in short-chain alkane metabolism suggests that such metabolic flexibility may be important in many environments where methane and short-chain alkanes co-occur.","[Crombie, Andrew T.; Murrell, J.

They are most abundant in the small intestine lamina propria, where their presence requires colonization of mice with microbiota(4-7). Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are sufficient to induce T(H)17 cells and to promote T(H)17-dependent autoimmune disease in animal models(8-14). However, the specificity of T(H)17 cells, the mechanism of their induction by distinct bacteria, and the means by which they foster tissue-specific inflammation remain unknown. Here we show that the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire of intestinal T(H)17 cells in SFB-colonized mice has minimal overlap with that of other intestinal CD4(+) T cells and that most T(H)17 cells, but not other T cells, recognize antigens encoded by SFB. T cells with antigen receptors specific for SFB-encoded peptides differentiated into ROR gamma t-expressing T(H)17 cells, even if SFB-colonized mice also harboured a strong T(H)1 cell inducer, Listeria monocytogenes, in their intestine. The match of T-cell effector function with antigen specificity is thus determined by the type of bacteria that produce the antigen. These findings have significant implications for understanding how commensal microbiota contribute to organ-specific autoimmunity and for developing novel mucosal vaccines.","[Yang, Yi; Torchinsky, Miriam B.; Gobert, Michael; Xiong, Huizhong; Xu, Mo; Ng, Charles; Chen, Alessandra; Lin, Xiyao; Sczesnak, Andrew; Liao, Jia-Jun; Lafaille, Juan J.; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Linehan, Jonathan L.; Jenkins, Marc K.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Ctr Immunol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Alonzo, Francis; Torres, Victor J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA","Littman, DR (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA.",dan.littman@med.nyu.edu,"Jenkins, Marc/G-1063-2012","Jenkins, Marc/0000-0001-8009-7655; Sczesnak, Andrew/0000-0002-0152-9745",National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [UL1 TR00038]; National Cancer Institute [5P30CA016087-32]; NIH [R01 AI039614]; Arthritis National Research Foundation; Irvington Institute fellowship program of the Cancer Research Institute,"We thank S.

To protect against invading pathogens, the skin harbours specialized immune cells, including dermal dendritic cells (DDCs) and interleukin (IL)-17-producing gamma delta T (gamma delta T17) cells, the aberrant activation of which by IL-23 can provoke psoriasis-like inflammation(1-4). The skin is also innervated by a meshwork of peripheral nerves consisting of relatively sparse autonomic and abundant sensory fibres. Interactions between the autonomic nervous system and immune cells in lymphoid organs are known to contribute to systemic immunity, but how peripheral nerves regulate cutaneous immune responses remains unclear(5,6). We exposed the skin of mice to imiquimod, which induces IL-23-dependent psoriasis-like inflammation(7,8). Hereweshowthat a subset of sensory neurons expressing the ion channels TRPV1 and Na(v)1.8 is essential to drive this inflammatory response. Imaging of intact skin revealed that a large fraction of DDCs, the principal source of IL-23, is in close contact with these nociceptors. Upon selective pharmacological or genetic ablation of nociceptors(9-11), DDCs failed to produce IL-23 in imiquimod-exposed skin. Consequently, the local production of IL-23-dependent inflammatory cytokines by dermal gamma delta T17 cells and the subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells to the skin were markedly reduced. Intradermal injection of IL-23 bypassed the requirement for nociceptor communicationwithDDCs and restored the inflammatory response(12). These findings indicate that TRPV1(+)Na(v)1.8(+) nociceptors, by interacting with DDCs, regulate the IL-23/IL-17 pathway andcontrol cutaneousimmune responses.","[Riol-Blanco, Lorena; Ordovas-Montanes, Jose; Perro, Mario; Naval, Elena; Thiriot, Aude; Alvarez, David; Paust, Silke; von Andrian, Ulrich H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wood, John N.] UCL, Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England","von Andrian, UH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",uva@hms.harvard.edu,,"Ordovas-Montanes, Jose/0000-0001-5444-5601","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI069259, AI078897, AI095261, AI111595]; NIH [5F31AR063546-02]; Human Frontiers Science Program; Charles A.

PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates(3-5). PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin(6,7) and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity(8) and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria(8-12). Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed(3-5), and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported(13-15). However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation(15), and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7 ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.","[Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan; [Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Kosako, Hidetaka] Univ Tokushima, Div Cell Signaling, Fujii Mem Inst Med Sci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Tamura, Yasushi] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Kimura, Yoko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Hirokawa, Takatsugu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Mol Profiling Res Ctr Drug Discovery, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, JST CREST Dept Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, JST CREST Fac Life Sci, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Fon, Edward A.] McGill Univ, McGill Parkinson Program, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal Neurol Inst & Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Trempe, Jean-Francois] McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Prot Metab Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan","Matsuda, N (reprint author), Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan.",tanaka-kj@igakuken.or.jp; matsuda-nr@igakuken.or.jp,"Kimura, Yoko/E-6845-2013; Yasushi, TAMURA/I-7122-2014; Tamura, Yasushi/H-8270-2017","Kimura, Yoko/0000-0002-3054-9753; ","JSPS KAKENHI [23687018, 23-6061, 21000012, 24657072, 22227003]; MEXT KAKENHI [24111557, 25112522, 24112008]; Tomizawa Jun-ichi and Keiko Fund; JST CREST; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from MEXT; McGill University; GRASP from the FRSQ; CIHR; FRSQ; Takeda Science Foundation","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 23687018 (to N.M.), 23-6061 (to K.O.), 21000012 (to K.

Centrosome amplification is poorly tolerated by non-transformed cells and, in the absence of selection, extra centrosomes are spontaneously lost(2). Thus, the high frequency of centrosome amplification, particularly in more aggressive tumours(3), raises the possibility that extra centrosomes could, in some contexts, confer advantageous characteristics that promote tumour progression. Using a three-dimensional model system and other approaches to culture human mammary epithelial cells, we find that centrosome amplification triggers cell invasion. This invasive behaviour is similar to that induced by overexpression of the breast cancer oncogene ERBB2 (ref.4) and indeed enhances invasiveness triggered by ERBB2. Our data indicate that, through increased centrosomal microtubule nucleation, centrosome amplification increases Rac1 activity, which disrupts normal cell-cell adhesion and promotes invasion. These findings demonstrate that centrosome amplification, a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, can promote features of malignant transformation.","[Godinho, Susana A.; Picone, Remigio; Dagher, Regina; Pellman, David] Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Godinho, Susana A.; Picone, Remigio; Dagher, Regina; Pellman, David] Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Godinho, Susana A.; Picone, Remigio; Dagher, Regina; Leung, Cheuk T.; Brugge, Joan S.; Pellman, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Burute, Mithila; Thery, Manuel] UMR5168 CEA UJF INRA CNRS, Inst Rech Technol & Sci Vivant, Grenoble, France; [Burute, Mithila; Thery, Manuel] U1160 INSERM AP HP Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Univ Hematol, Hop St Louis, F-75010 Paris, France; [Burute, Mithila] CYTOO SA, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Su, Ying; Polyak, Kornelia] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Godinho, SA (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",s.godinho@qmul.ac.uk; david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,,,FCT [HMSP-CT/SAU-ICT/0075/2009]; ERC [310472]; ISI program of BPIFrance; NIH [GM083299-1],"We are grateful to S.

Fundamental questions remain however regarding the extent of membrane protein selectivity towards lipids. Here we report a mass spectrometry approach designed to determine the selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. We investigate the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Myco-bacterium tuberculosis and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) and the ammonia channel (AmtB) from Escherichia coli, using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which reports gas-phase collision cross-sections. We demonstrate that folded conformations of membrane protein complexes can exist in the gas phase. By resolving lipid-bound states, we then rank bound lipids on the basis of their ability to resist gas phase unfolding and thereby stabilize membrane protein structure. Lipids bind non-selectively and with high avidity to MscL, all imparting comparable stability; however, the highest-ranking lipid is phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in line with its proposed functional role in mechanosensation(9). AqpZ is also stabilized by many lipids, with cardiolipin imparting the most significant resistance to unfolding. Subsequently, through functional assays we show that cardiolipin modulates AqpZ function. Similar experiments identify AmtB as being highly selective for phosphatidylglycerol, prompting us to obtain an X-ray structure in this lipid membrane-like environment. The 2.3 angstrom resolution structure, when compared with others obtained without lipid bound, reveals distinct conformational changes that re-position AmtB residues to interact with the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that resistance to unfolding correlates with specific lipid-binding events, enabling a distinction to be made between lipids that merely bind from those that modulate membrane protein structure and/or function. We anticipate that these findings will be important not only for defining the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, but also for understanding the role of lipids in modulating protein function or drug binding.","[Laganowsky, Arthur; Reading, Eamonn; Allison, Timothy M.; Degiacomi, Matteo T.; Baldwin, Andrew J.; Robinson, Carol V.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Oxford OX1 5QY, England; [Ulmschneider, Martin B.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Laganowsky, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 5QY, England.",art.laganowsky@chem.ox.ac.uk; carol.robinson@chem.ox.ac.uk,"Baldwin, Andrew/A-5830-2015; Ulmschneider, Martin/J-4374-2012; Degiacomi, Matteo/M-4342-2017","Baldwin, Andrew/0000-0001-7579-8844; Degiacomi, Matteo/0000-0003-4672-471X",Medical Research Council (MRC); BBSRC; ERC,"We thank J.

However, until now little was known about visceral arches in early gnathostomes, and theories about gill arch evolution were driven by information gleaned mostly from both modern cartilaginous (chondrichthyan) and bony (osteichthyan) fishes. New fossil discoveries can profoundly affect our understanding of evolutionary history, by revealing hitherto unseen combinations of primitive and derived characters. Here we describe a 325 million year (Myr)-old Palaeozoic shark-like fossil that represents, to our knowledge, the earliest identified chondrichthyan in which the complete gill skeleton is three-dimensionally preserved in its natural position. Its visceral arch arrangement is remarkably osteichthyan-like, suggesting that this may represent the common ancestral condition for crown gnathostomes. Our findings thus reinterpret the polarity of some arch features of the crown jawed vertebrates and invert the classic hypothesis, in which modern sharks retain the ancestral condition. This study underscores the importance of early chondrichthyans in resolving the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.","[Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Mapes, Royal H.] Ohio Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Mallatt, Jon] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Pradel, A (reprint author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",apradel@amnh.org; maisey@amnh.org,,,H.

In the bacterial Csr/Rsm system, which is considered to be the most general global post-transcriptional regulatory system responsible for bacterial virulence, ncRNAs such as CsrB or RsmZ activate translation initiation by sequestering homodimeric CsrA-type proteins from the ribosome-binding site of a subset of messenger RNAs. However, the mechanism of ncRNA-mediated protein sequestration is not understood at the molecular level. Here we show for Pseudomonas fluorescens that RsmE protein dimers assemble sequentially, specifically and cooperatively onto the ncRNA RsmZ within a narrow affinity range. This assembly yields two different native ribonucleoprotein structures. Using a powerful combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy we elucidate these 70-kilodalton solution structures, thereby revealing the molecular mechanism of the sequestration process and how RsmE binding protects the ncRNA from RNase E degradation. Overall, our findings suggest that RsmZ is well-tuned to sequester, store and release RsmE and therefore can be viewed as an ideal protein 'sponge'.","[Duss, Olivier; Michel, Erich; Schubert, Mario; Allain, Frederic H. -T.] ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Yulikov, Maxim; Jeschke, Gunnar] ETH, Phys Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Allain, FHT (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",allain@mol.biol.ethz.ch,"Schubert, Mario/B-3972-2008","Schubert, Mario/0000-0003-0278-4091","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [3100A0-118118, 31003ab-133134, 31003A-149921]; SNF-NCCR structural biology Iso-lab","We thank G.

Despite their sheer abundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. The available evidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rocky planets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thick hydrogen and helium gas envelopes. Here we report the metallicities (that is, the abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanet candidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into three populations defined by statistically distinct (similar to 4.5 sigma) metallicity regions. We interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes of terrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 Earth radii), gas dwarf planets with rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 Earth radii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 Earth radii). These transitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates(2,3), implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solids inventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating the structure of planetary systems.","[Buchhave, Lars A.; Latham, David W.; Sasselov, Dimitar] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.; Bizzarro, Martin; Juncher, Diana] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Star & Planet Format, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Cochran, William D.; Endl, Michael] Univ Texas Austin, McDonald Observ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Isaacson, Howard; Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Juncher, Diana] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Buchhave, LA (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lbuchhave@cfa.harvard.edu,"Bizzarro, Martin/I-8701-2012","Bizzarro, Martin/0000-0001-9966-2124; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666","Harvard Origins of Life Initiative; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF97]; European Research Council [616027- STARDUST2ASTEROIDS]; Kepler Mission under NASA [NCC2-1390, NNX11AB99A, NNX13AB58A]; Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory","L.A.B. acknowledges support from the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative.

So far mu(p) has been measured only indirectly, by analysing the spectrum of an atomic hydrogen maser in a magnetic field(1). Here we report the direct high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment of a single proton using the double Penning-trap technique(2). We drive proton-spin quantum jumps by a magnetic radio-frequency field in a Penning trap with a homogeneous magnetic field. The induced spin transitions are detected in a second trap with a strong superimposed magnetic inhomogeneity(3). This enables the measurement of the spin-flip probability as a function of the drive frequency. In each measurement the proton's cyclotron frequency is used to determine the magnetic field of the trap. From the normalized resonance curve, we extract the particle's magnetic moment in terms of the nuclear magneton: mu(p) = 2.792847350(9)mu(N). This measurement outperforms previous Penning-trap measurements(4,5) in terms of precision by a factor of about 760. It improves the precision of the forty-year-old indirect measurement, in which significant theoretical bound state corrections(6) were required to obtain mu(p), by a factor of 3. By application of this method to the antiproton magnetic moment, the fractional precision of the recently reported value(7) can be improved by a factor of at least 1,000. Combined with the present result, this will provide a stringent test of matter/antimatter symmetry with baryons(8).","[Mooser, A.; Kracke, H.; Leiteritz, C.; Rodegheri, C.

Although the uptake of carbon by oceanic and terrestrial processes has kept pace with accelerating carbon dioxide emissions until now, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations exhibit a large variability on interannual timescales(2), considered to be driven primarily by terrestrial ecosystem processes dominated by tropical rainforests(3). We use a terrestrial biogeochemical model, atmospheric carbon dioxide inversion and global carbon budget accounting methods to investigate the evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink over the past 30 years, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the exceptionally large land carbon sink reported in 2011 (ref. 2). Here we show that our three terrestrial carbon sink estimates are in good agreement and support the finding of a 2011 record land carbon sink. Surprisingly, we find that the global carbon sink anomaly was driven by growth of semi-arid vegetation in the Southern Hemisphere, with almost 60 per cent of carbon uptake attributed to Australian ecosystems, where prevalent La Nina conditions caused up to six consecutive seasons of increased precipitation. In addition, since 1981, a six per cent expansion of vegetation cover over Australia was associated with a fourfold increase in the sensitivity of continental net carbon uptake to precipitation. Our findings suggest that the higher turnover rates of carbon pools in semi-arid biomes are an increasingly important driver of global carbon cycle inter-annual variability and that tropical rainforests may become less relevant drivers in the future. More research is needed to identify to what extent the carbon stocks accumulated during wet years are vulnerable to rapid decomposition or loss through fire in subsequent years.","[Poulter, Benjamin] Montana State Univ, Inst Ecosyst, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Poulter, Benjamin] Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Poulter, Benjamin; Ciais, Philippe; Broquet, Gregoire; Chevallier, Frederic] CEA CNRS UVSQ, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Frank, David] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Frank, David] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Myneni, Ranga B.; Bi, Jian] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Andela, Niels; van der Werf, Guido R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Canadell, Josep G.] CSIRO, Global Carbon Project, Marine & Atmospher Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Running, Steven W.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Comp & Math, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England","Poulter, B (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Inst Ecosyst, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",benjamin.poulter@montana.edu,"Myneni, Ranga/F-5129-2012; Sitch, Stephen/F-8034-2015; Frank, David/C-7764-2013; Canadell, Josep/E-9419-2010; Liu, Yi/H-9226-2013; Chevallier, Frederic/E-9608-2016; Liu, Yi/M-7169-2015; van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016","Sitch, Stephen/0000-0003-1821-8561; Canadell, Josep/0000-0002-8788-3218; Chevallier, Frederic/0000-0002-4327-3813; Liu, Yi/0000-0001-9059-8269; van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; Poulter, Benjamin/0000-0002-9493-8600",EU FP7 GEOCARBON programme [283080]; Australian Climate Change Science Program; NASA Earth Science Division,"We acknowledge support from the EU FP7 GEOCARBON programme (283080), and thank the researchers involved with collecting and maintaining the climate data at the Climate Research Unit, University of East Anglia, UK, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA.

Without improved knowledge of ice breakup, we are unable to understand recent changes, or predict future changes, in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. Here we show that storm-generated ocean waves propagating through Antarctic sea ice are able to transport enough energy to break sea ice hundreds of kilometres from the ice edge. Our results, which are based on concurrent observations at multiple locations, establish that large waves break sea ice much farther from the ice edge than would be predicted by the commonly assumed exponential decay(1-3). We observed the wave height decay to be almost linear for large waves-those with a significant wave height greater than three metres-and to be exponential only for small waves. This implies a more prominent role for large ocean waves in sea-ice breakup and retreat than previously thought. We examine the wider relevance of this by comparing observed Antarctic sea-ice edge positions with changes in modelled significant wave heights for the Southern Ocean between 1997 and 2009, and find that the retreat and expansion of the sea-ice edge correlate with mean significant wave height increases and decreases, respectively. This includes capturing the spatial variability in sea-ice trends found in the Ross and Amundsen-Bellingshausen seas. Climate models fail to capture recent changes in sea ice in both polar regions(4,5). Our results suggest that the incorporation of explicit or parameterized interactions between ocean waves and sea ice may resolve this problem.","[Kohout, A.

Despite the apparent overlap between soil and clinical resistomes(4-6), factors influencing ARG composition in soil and their movement between genomes and habitats remain largely unknown(3). General metagenome functions often correlate with the underlying structure of bacterial communities(7-12). However, ARGs are proposed to be highly mobile(4,5,13), prompting speculation that resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or ecological divisions(13,14). To investigate these relationships, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from 18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895 ARGs we discovered were mostly new, and represent all major resistance mechanisms(15). We demonstrate that distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes, and that the addition of nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG content. Resistome composition also correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types. Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes responsible for horizontal gene transfer between bacteria such as transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil by comparison with sequenced pathogens, suggesting that ARGs may not transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed between human pathogens. Together, our results indicate that bacterial community composition is the primary determinant of soil ARG content, challenging previous hypotheses that horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples resistomes from phylogeny(13,14).","[Forsberg, Kevin J.; Patel, Sanket; Gibson, Molly K.; Dantas, Gautam] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Patel, Sanket; Dantas, Gautam] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Lauber, Christian L.; Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, BioFrontiers Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Knight, Rob] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dantas, Gautam] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Dantas, G (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",dantas@wustl.edu,"; Knight, Rob/D-1299-2010","Dantas, Gautam/0000-0003-0455-8370; Knight, Rob/0000-0002-0975-9019",Children's Discovery Institute [MD-II-2011-117]; International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability at Washington University; National Academies Keck Futures Initiatives [SB2]; NIH Director's New Innovator Award [DP2-DK-098089]; Mr and Mrs Spencer T.

Whether non-neuronal cells tune touch receptors through active or passive mechanisms is debated. Terminal specializations are thought to function as passive mechanical filters analogous to the cochlea's basilar membrane, which deconstructs complex sounds into tones that are transduced by mechanosensory hair cells. The model that cutaneous specializations are merely passive has been recently challenged because epidermal cells express sensory ion channels and neurotransmitters(2,3); however, direct evidence that epidermal cells excite tactile afferents is lacking. Epidermal Merkel cells display features of sensory receptor cells(4,5) and make 'synapse-like' contacts(5,6) with slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents(7-9). These complexes, which encode spatial features such as edges and texture(1), localize to skin regions with high tactile acuity, including whisker follicles, fingertips and touch domes. Here we show that Merkel cells actively participate in touch reception in mice. Merkel cells display fast, touch-evoked mechanotransduction currents. Optogenetic approaches in intact skin show that Merkel cells are both necessary and sufficient for sustained action-potential firing in tactile afferents. Recordings from touch-dome afferents lacking Merkel cells demonstrate that Merkel cells confer high-frequency responses to dynamic stimuli and enable sustained firing. These data are the first, to our knowledge, to directly demonstrate a functional, excitatory connection between epidermal cells and sensory neurons. Together, these findings indicate that Merkel cells actively tune mechanosensory responses to facilitate high spatio-temporal acuity. Moreover, our results indicate a division of labour in the Merkel cell-neurite complex: Merkel cells signal static stimuli, such as pressure, whereas sensory afferents transduce dynamic stimuli, such as moving gratings. Thus, the Merkel cell-neurite complex is an unique sensory structure composed of two different receptor cell types specialized for distinct elements of discriminative touch.","[Maksimovic, Srdjan; Nakatani, Masashi; Baba, Yoshichika; Nelson, Aislyn M.; Marshall, Kara L.; Lumpkin, Ellen A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Nakatani, Masashi] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Syst Design & Management, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238526, Japan; [Nelson, Aislyn M.; Wellnitz, Scott A.; Firozi, Pervez] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77006 USA; [Woo, Seung-Hyun; Ranade, Sanjeev; Patapoutian, Ardem] Scripps Res Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lumpkin, Ellen A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lumpkin, Ellen A.] Columbia Univ, Program Neurobiol & Behav, New York, NY 10032 USA","Lumpkin, EA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10032 USA.",eal2166@columbia.edu,,,"NIH/NIAMS [R01AR051219, R21AR062307, R01DE022358]; NIH/NINDS [F32NS080544]; JSPS [24-7585]; McNair Foundation;  [5T32HL087745-05]","Thanks to R.

The Merkel cell-neurite complex is a gentle touch receptor in the skin that mediates slowly adapting responses of A beta sensory fibres to encode fine details of objects(3-6). This mechanoreceptor complex was recognized to have an essential role in sensing gentle touch nearly 50 years ago(3,4). However, whether Merkel cells or afferent fibres themselves sense mechanical force is still debated, and the molecular mechanism of mechanotransduction is unknown(1,2,7-12). Synapse-like junctions are observed between Merkel cells and associated afferents(6,13-15), and yet it is unclear whether Merkel cells are inherently mechanosensitive or whether they can rapidly transmit such information to the neighbouring nerve(1,2,16,17). Here we show that Merkel cells produce touch-sensitive currents in vitro. Piezo2, a mechanically activated cation channel, is expressed in Merkel cells. We engineered mice deficient in Piezo2 in the skin, but not in sensory neurons, and show that Merkel-cell mechanosensitivity completely depends on Piezo2. In these mice, slowly adapting responses in vivo mediated by the Merkel cell-neurite complex show reduced static firing rates, and moreover, the mice display moderately decreased behavioural responses to gentle touch. Our results indicate that Piezo2 is the Merkel-cell mechanotransduction channel and provide the first line of evidence that Piezo channels have a physiological role in mechanosensation in mammals. Furthermore, our data present evidence for a two-receptor-site model, in which both Merkel cells and innervating afferents act together as mechanosensors. The two-receptor system could provide this mechanoreceptor complex with a tuning mechanism to achieve highly sophisticated responses to a given mechanical stimulus(15,18,19).","[Woo, Seung-Hyun; Ranade, Sanjeev; Dubin, Adrienne E.; Qiu, Zhaozhu; Miyamoto, Takashi; Patapoutian, Ardem] Scripps Res Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Weyer, Andy D.; Stucky, Cheryl L.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Cell Biol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Weyer, Andy D.; Stucky, Cheryl L.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Neurobiol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Weyer, Andy D.; Stucky, Cheryl L.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Anat, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Baba, Yoshichika; Lumpkin, Ellen A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Baba, Yoshichika; Lumpkin, Ellen A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Qiu, Zhaozhu; Petrus, Matt; Reddy, Kritika] Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Patapoutian, A (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",ardem@scripps.edu,,"Weyer, Andy/0000-0003-4485-9530","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH [R01DE022358, R01AR051219]",We would like to thank S.

How such escalation is encoded in the brain, and linked to behavioural action selection, remains an unsolved problem in neuroscience. The ventrolateral subdivision of the murine ventromedial hypothalamus(VMHvl) contains neurons whose activity increases during male-male and male-female social encounters. Non-cell-type-specific optogenetic activation of this region elicited attack behaviour, but not mounting(3). We have identified a subset of VMHvl neurons marked by the oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1), and investigated their role in male social behaviour. Optogenetic manipulations indicated that Esr1(+) (but not Esr1(-)) neurons are sufficient to initiate attack, and that their activity is continuously required during ongoing agonistic behaviour. Surprisingly, weaker optogenetic activation of these neurons promoted mounting behaviour, rather than attack, towards both males and females, as well as sniffing and close investigation. Increasing photostimulation intensity could promote a transition from close investigation and mounting to attack, within a single social encounter. Importantly, time-resolved optogenetic inhibition experiments revealed requirements for Esr1(+) neurons in both the appetitive (investigative) and the consummatory phases of social interactions. Combined optogenetic activation and calcium imaging experiments in vitro, as well as c-Fos analysis in vivo, indicated that increasing photostimulation intensity increases both the number of active neurons and the average level of activity per neuron. These data suggest that Esr1(+) neurons in VMHvl control the progression of a social encounter from its appetitive through its consummatory phases, in a scalable manner that reflects the number or type of active neurons in the population.","[Lee, Hyosang; Remedios, Ryan; Anthony, Todd E.; Chang, Angela; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn 156 29, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Lee, Hyosang; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kim, Dong-Wook; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Madisen, Linda; Zeng, Hongkui] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA","Anderson, DJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn 156 29, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",wuwei@caltech.edu,,"Remedios, Ryan/0000-0001-6004-808X","NIH [R01MH070053, 1K99NS074077, 1F32HD055198-01]; Gordon Moore Foundation; Ellison Medical Research Foundation; Beckman Fellowship","We thank C.

In this system, males have two Z sex chromosomes, whereas females have Z and W sex chromosomes. The silkworm W chromosome has a dominant role in female determination(1,2), suggesting the existence of a dominant feminizing gene in this chromosome. However, the W chromosomeis almost fully occupied by transposable element sequences(3-5), and no functional protein-coding gene has been identified so far. Female-enriched PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are the only known transcripts that are produced from the sex-determining region of the W chromosome(6), but the function(s) of these piRNAs are unknown. Here we show that a W-chromosome-derived, female-specific piRNA is the feminizing factor of B. mori. This piRNA is produced from a piRNA precursor which we named Fem. Fem sequences were arranged in tandem in the sex-determining region of the W chromosome. Inhibition of Fem-derived piRNA-mediated signalling in female embryos led to the production of the male-specific splice variants of B. mori doublesex (Bmdsx), a gene which acts at the downstream end of the sex differentiation cascade(7,8). A target gene of Fem-derived piRNA was identified on the Z chromosome of B. mori. This gene, which we named Masc, encoded a CCCH-type zinc finger protein. We show that the silencing of Masc messenger RNA by Fem piRNA is required for the production of female-specific isoforms of Bmdsx in female embryos, and that Masc protein controls both dosage compensation and masculinization in male embryos. Our study characterizes a single small RNA that is responsible for primary sex determination in the WZ sex determination system.","[Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Shimada, Toru; Katsuma, Susumu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Sakai, Hiroki; Suzuki, Masataka G.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Sugano, Sumio; Suzuki, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan","Katsuma, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",katsuma@ss.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Shimada, Toru/A-2033-2011","Shimada, Toru/0000-0002-5791-0000",Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry;  [22115502];  [22128004],We thank S.

High-affinity B cells are expanded through iterative interzonal cycles of division and hypermutation in the GC dark zone followed by migration to the GC light zone, where they are selected on the basis of affinity to return to the dark zone(5-10). Here we combine a transgenic strategy to measure cell division and a photoactivatable fluorescent reporter to examine whether the extent of clonal expansion and hypermutation are regulated during interzonal GC cycles. We find that both cell division and hypermutation are directly proportional to the amount of antigen captured and presented by GC B cells to follicular helper T cells in the light zone.

Here we show that during the development of myointimal hyperplasia in human arteries, SMCs show hyperpolarization of their mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) and acquire a temporary state with a high proliferative rate and resistance to apoptosis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK2) was identified as a key regulatory protein, and its activation proved necessary for relevant myointima formation. Pharmacologic PDK2 blockade with dichloroacetate or lentiviral PDK2 knockdown prevented Delta Psi m hyperpolarization, facilitated apoptosis and reduced myointima formation in injured human mammary and coronary arteries, rat aortas, rabbit iliac arteries and swine (pig) coronary arteries. In contrast to several commonly used antiproliferative drugs, dichloroacetate did not prevent vessel re-endothelialization. Targeting myointimal Delta Psi m and alleviating apoptosis resistance is a novel strategy for the prevention of proliferative vascular diseases.","[Deuse, Tobias; Hua, Xiaoqin; Wang, Dong; Stubbendorff, Mandy; Itagaki, Ryo; Schrepfer, Sonja] Univ Heart Ctr Hamburg, TSI Lab, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Deuse, Tobias; Hua, Xiaoqin; Wang, Dong; Stubbendorff, Mandy; Zeller, Tanja; Schulte-Uentrop, Leonie; Stoehr, Andrea; Itagaki, Ryo; Eschenhagen, Thomas; Blankenberg, Stefan; Kiefmann, Rainer; Reichenspurner, Hermann; Schrepfer, Sonja] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Cardiovasc Res Ctr Hamburg CVRC, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Deuse, Tobias; Hua, Xiaoqin; Wang, Dong; Stubbendorff, Mandy; Zeller, Tanja; Schulte-Uentrop, Leonie; Stoehr, Andrea; Itagaki, Ryo; Eschenhagen, Thomas; Blankenberg, Stefan; Kiefmann, Rainer; Reichenspurner, Hermann; Schrepfer, Sonja] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Partner Site Hamburg Kiel Luebeck, DZHK German Ctr Cardiovasc Res, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Deuse, Tobias; Reichenspurner, Hermann; Schrepfer, Sonja] Univ Heart Ctr Hamburg, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Maegdefessel, Lars] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med, Atherosclerosis Res Unit, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Heeren, Joerg; Scheja, Ludger] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Biochem & Mol Cell Biol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Bolanos, Juan P.] Univ Salamanca, CSIC, Inst Funct Biol & Genom, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Rakovic, Aleksandar; Klein, Christine] Med Univ Lubeck, Inst Neurogenet, D-23562 Lubeck, Germany; [Spin, Joshua M.; Ikeno, Fumiaki; Haddad, Francois; Yeung, Alan; Tsao, Philip S.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Spin, Joshua M.; Ikeno, Fumiaki; Haddad, Francois; Yeung, Alan; Robbins, Robert C.; Tsao, Philip S.; Schrepfer, Sonja] Stanford Univ, Stanford Cardiovasc Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Laenger, Florian] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Pathol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Zeller, Tanja; Blankenberg, Stefan] Univ Heart Ctr Hamburg, Dept Gen & Intervent Cardiol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Schulte-Uentrop, Leonie; Kiefmann, Rainer] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Anaesthesiol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Stoehr, Andrea; Eschenhagen, Thomas] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Expt Pharmacol & Toxicol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Velden, Joachim] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Inst Pathol, Dept Nephropathol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Robbins, Robert C.; Schrepfer, Sonja] Stanford Univ, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tsao, Philip S.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Schrepfer, S (reprint author), Univ Heart Ctr Hamburg, TSI Lab, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",schrepfer@stanford.edu,"Maegdefessel, Lars/C-2955-2015","Maegdefessel, Lars/0000-0001-5228-2634","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) [SCHR992/3-1, SCHR992/4-1]; International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT); Forderverein des Universitaren Herzzentrums Hamburg; Hermann and Lilly Schilling Foundation; MINECO [SAF2013-41177-R]; NIH [NIH 1R01HL105299]","We thank C.

Deletions are targeted by scnRNAs, small RNAs produced from the germ line during meiosis that first scan the maternal macronuclear genome to identify missing sequences, and then allow the zygotic macronucleus to reproduce the same deletions. Here we show that this process accounts for the maternal inheritance of mating types in Paramecium tetraurelia, a long-standing problem in epigenetics. Mating type E depends on expression of the transmembrane protein mtA, and the default type O is determined during development by scnRNA-dependent excision of the mtA promoter. In the sibling species Paramecium septaurelia, mating type O is determined by coding-sequence deletions in a different gene, mtB, which is specifically required for mtA expression. These independently evolved mechanisms suggest frequent exaptation of the scnRNA pathway to regulate cellular genes and mediate transgene-rational epigenetic inheritance of essential phenotypic polymorphisms.","[Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Meyer, Eric] Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Meyer, Eric] INSERM, U1024, F-75005 Paris, France; [Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Meyer, Eric] CNRS, UMR 8197, F-75005 Paris, France; [Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Lhuillier-Akakpo, Maoussi] UPMC Univ, Univ Paris 04, IFD, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Arnaiz, Olivier; Aubusson-Fleury, Anne; Sperling, Linda] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, UPR3404, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Arnaiz, Olivier; Aubusson-Fleury, Anne; Sperling, Linda] Univ Paris 11, Dept Biol, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Gout, Jean-Francois] Univ Lyon, UMR5558, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Prajer, Malgorzata; Przybos, Ewa] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Potekhin, Alexey] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Fac Biol, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Lhuillier-Akakpo, Maoussi; Duharcourt, Sandra] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS, Inst Jacques Monod,UMR 7592, F-75205 Paris, France; [Alberti, Adriana; Labadie, Karine; Aury, Jean-Marc] CEA, IG, Genoscope, F-91057 Evry, France","Meyer, E (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France.",emeyer@biologie.ens.fr,"Sperling, Linda/C-9734-2014; Alberti, Adriana/E-7142-2017","Alberti, Adriana/0000-0003-3372-9423; AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; ARNAIZ, Olivier/0000-0002-9626-1015; Sperling, Linda/0000-0002-7772-4774; Meyer, Eric/0000-0002-3161-8597","'Investissements d'Avenir' program, Paris Sciences et Lettres* Research University [ANR-10-LABX-54 MEMO LIFE/ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; 'Equipe FRM' grant; CNRS ATIP-Avenir; National Science Foundation [MCB-1050161]; Erasmus Mundus program; Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche; Fondation de la Recherche Medicale; CNRS;  [ANR-08-BLAN-0233];  [ANR-12-BSV6-0017];  [ANR-2010-BLAN-1603];  [RFBR 13-04-01683a]","We thank S.

Activity in neuronal circuits is tightly regulated by different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, yet their role in learning is poorly understood. Using a combination of in vivo single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we show that in the mouse basolateral amygdala, interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) bidirectionally control the acquisition of fear conditioning-a simple form of associative learning-through two distinct disinhibitory mechanisms. During an auditory cue, PV+ interneurons are excited and indirectly disinhibit the dendrites of basolateral amygdala principal neurons via SOM+ interneurons, thereby enhancing auditory responses and promoting cue-shock associations. During an aversive footshock, however, both PV+ and SOM+ interneurons are inhibited, which boosts postsynaptic footshock responses and gates learning. These results demonstrate that associative learning is dynamically regulated by the stimulus-specific activation of distinct disinhibitory microcircuits through precise interactions between different subtypes of local interneurons.","[Wolff, Steffen B.

Addictive drugs are proposed to hijack this system, enabling drug-associated cues to trigger relapse to drug seeking. However, the connections affected and proof of causality remain to be established. Here we use a mouse model of delayed cue-associated cocaine seeking with ex vivo electrophysiology in optogenetically delineated circuits. We find that seeking correlates with rectifying AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor transmission and a reduced AMPA/NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) ratio at medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens shell D1-receptor medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs). In contrast, the AMPA/NMDA ratio increases at ventral hippocampus to D1R-MSNs. Optogenetic reversal of cocaine-evoked plasticity at both inputs abolishes seeking, whereas selective reversal at mPFC or ventral hippocampus synapses impairs response discrimination or reduces response vigour during seeking, respectively. Taken together, we describe how information integration in the nucleus accumbens is commandeered by cocaine at discrete synapses to allow relapse. Our approach holds promise for identifying synaptic causalities in other behavioural disorders.","[Pascoli, Vincent; Terrier, Jean; O'Connor, Eoin Cornelius; Luescher, Christian] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] CNRS, INSERM, U661, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] CNRS, Inst Genom Fonct, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier I, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier 2, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Luescher, Christian] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Clin Neurol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Luscher, C (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",christian.luscher@unige.ch,"Luscher, Christian/A-2496-2011","Luscher, Christian/0000-0001-7917-4596",Swiss National Science Foundation; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) 'SYNAPSY - The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases' of the Swiss National Science Foundation; European Research Council advanced grant (MeSSI); MD-PhD grant of the Swiss Confederation; Avenir grant (Inserm); Agence Nationale de la Recherche,"We thank D.

Competition may be relevant for cancer, but an experimental link between defects in competition and tumorigenesis is elusive. In the thymus, T lymphocytes develop from precursors that are constantly replaced by bone-marrow-derived progenitors. Here we show that in mice this turnover is regulated by natural cell competition between 'young' bone-marrow-derived and 'old' thymus-resident progenitors that, although genetically identical, execute differential gene expression programs. Disruption of cell competition leads to progenitor self-renewal, upregulation of Hmga1, transformation, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) resembling the human disease in pathology, genomic lesions, leukaemia-associated transcripts, and activating mutations in Notch1. Hence, cell competition is a tumour suppressor mechanism in the thymus. Failure to select fit progenitors through cell competition may explain leukaemia in X-linked severe combined immune deficiency patients who showed thymus-autonomous T-cell development after therapy with gene-corrected autologous progenitors.","[Martins, Vera C.; Busch, Katrin; Rodewald, Hans-Reimer] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Cellular Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Martins, Vera C.; Blum, Carmen; Ludwig, Carolin; Fehling, Hans Joerg] Univ Ulm, Inst Immunol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Juraeva, Dilafruz; Mastitsky, Sergey E.; Brors, Benedikt] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Bioinformat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Rasche, Volker] Univ Ulm, Core Facil Small Anim MRI, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Lasitschka, Felix] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Inst Pathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hielscher, Thomas] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Biostat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Rodewald, HR (reprint author), German Canc Res Ctr, Div Cellular Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",hr.rodewald@dkfz.de,"Brors, Benedikt/E-5620-2013; Martins, Vera/M-1356-2015; Rasche, Volker/P-6523-2016","Brors, Benedikt/0000-0001-5940-3101; Martins, Vera/0000-0001-8717-9709; Rasche, Volker/0000-0001-8844-3583",ERC Advanced Grant [233074]; DFG-SFB938-project L; Helmholtz PCCC Alliance,"We thank A.

An appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient WRSs are the progenitors of some hydrogen-poor supernova explosions of types IIb, Ib and Ic (ref. 2). A blue object, having luminosity and colours consistent with those of some WRSs, has recently been identified in pre-explosion images at the location of a supernova of type Ib (ref. 3), but has not yet been conclusively determined to have been the progenitor. Similar work has so far only resulted in non-detections(4). Comparison of early photometric observations of type Ic supernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii of less than 1012 centimetres, as expected for some WRSs(5). The signature of WRSs, their emission line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. Here we report the detection of strong emission lines in a spectrum of type IIb supernova 2013cu (iPTF13ast) obtained approximately 15.5 hours after explosion (by 'flash spectroscopy', which captures the effects of the supernova explosion shock breakout flash on material surrounding the progenitor star). We identify Wolf-Rayet-like wind signatures, suggesting a progenitor of the WN(h) subclass (those WRSs with winds dominated by helium and nitrogen, with traces of hydrogen). The extent of this dense wind may indicate increased mass loss from the progenitor shortly before its explosion, consistent with recent theoretical predictions(6).","[Gal-Yam, Avishay; Arcavi, I.; Ofek, E.

J,"Sasaki, T; Yamamoto, Y; Koashi, M",,,,"Sasaki, Toshihiko; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa; Koashi, Masato",,,Practical quantum key distribution protocol without monitoring signal disturbance,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SINGLE-PHOTON SOURCE; CRYPTOGRAPHY; SECURITY; STATES,"Quantum cryptography(1-8) exploits the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to provide a secure way to exchange private information. Such an exchange requires a common random bit sequence, called a key, to be shared secretly between the sender and the receiver. The basic idea behind quantum key distribution (QKD) has widely been understood as the property that any attempt to distinguish encoded quantum states causes a disturbance in the signal. As a result, implementation of a QKD protocol involves an estimation of the experimental parameters influenced by the eavesdropper's intervention, which is achieved by randomly sampling the signal. If the estimation of many parameters with high precision is required, the portion of the signal that is sacrificed increases, thus decreasing the efficiency of the protocol(9,10). Here we propose a QKD protocol based on an entirely different principle. The sender encodes a bit sequence onto non-orthogonal quantum states and the receiver randomly dictates how a single bit should be calculated from the sequence. The eavesdropper, who is unable to learn the whole of the sequence, cannot guess the bit value correctly. An achievable rate of secure key distribution is calculated by considering complementary choices between quantum measurements of two conjugate observables(11). We found that a practical implementation using a laser pulse train achieves a key rate comparable to a decoy-state QKD protocol(12-14), an often-used technique for lasers. It also has a better tolerance of bit errors and of finite-sized-key effects. We anticipate that this finding will give new insight into how the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics can be related to secure communication, and will facilitate the simple and efficient use of conventional lasers for QKD.","[Sasaki, Toshihiko; Koashi, Masato] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Photon Sci Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, EL Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan","Koashi, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Photon Sci Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",koashi@qi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yamamoto, Yoshihisa/A-2811-2012",,Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R & D on Science and Technology (FIRST); MEXT [21102008]; Photon Frontier Network Program (MEXT),"We thank H.

This marked increase, which is among the highest globally, has previously been attributed primarily to enhanced poleward moisture transport from lower latitudes(3,4). Here we use state-of-the-art global climate models(5) to show that the projected increases in Arctic precipitation over the twenty-first century, which peak in late autumn and winter, are instead due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation (maximum in winter), and only to a lesser degree due to enhanced moisture inflow from lower latitudes(maximum in late summer and autumn). Moreover, we show that the enhanced surface evaporation results mainly from retreating winter sea ice, signalling an amplified Arctic hydrological cycle. This demonstrates that increases in Arctic precipitation are firmly linked to Arctic warming and sea-ice decline. As a result, the Arctic mean precipitation sensitivity (4.5 per cent increase per degree of temperature warming) is much larger than the global value (1.6 to 1.9 per cent per kelvin). The associated seasonally varying increase in Arctic precipitation is likely to increase river discharge(6-8) and snowfall over ice sheets(9) (thereby affecting global sea level), and could even affect global climate through freshening of the Arctic Ocean and subsequent modulations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(10,11).","[Bintanja, R.; Selten, F.

The volume of groundwater lost over the past century and a half also represents a substantial reduction in mass and a large-scale unburdening of the lithosphere, with significant but unexplored potential impacts on crustal deformation and seismicity. Here we use vertical global positioning system measurements to show that a broad zone of rock uplift of up to 1-3 mm per year surrounds the southern San Joaquin Valley. The observed uplift matches well with predicted flexure from a simple elastic model of current rates of water-storage loss, most of which is caused by groundwater depletion(3). The height of the adjacent central Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada is strongly seasonal and peaks during the dry late summer and autumn, out of phase with uplift of the valley floor during wetter months. Our results suggest that long-term and late-summer flexural uplift of the Coast Ranges reduce the effective normal stress resolved on the San Andreas Fault. This process brings the fault closer to failure, thereby providing a viable mechanism for observed seasonality in microseismicity at Parkfield(6) and potentially affecting long-term seismicity rates for fault systems adjacent to the valley. We also infer that the observed contemporary uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada previously attributed to tectonic or mantle-derived forces(7-10) is partly a consequence of human-caused groundwater depletion.","[Amos, Colin B.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Geol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Audet, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey] Univ Nevada, Nevada Geodet Lab, Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey] Univ Nevada, Nevada Seismol Lab, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Buergmann, Roland; Johanson, Ingrid A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Amos, CB (reprint author), Western Washington Univ, Dept Geol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",colin.amos@wwu.edu,"Amos, Colin/B-2397-2008","Amos, Colin/0000-0002-3862-9344; Johanson, Ingrid/0000-0002-6049-2225",NSF Earth Scope award [EAR-1252210],"Funding for this work comes from NSF Earth Scope award number EAR-1252210 to G.

BRAF(V600E) phosphorylates and activates the MEK1 andMEK2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the ERK1 and ERK2 kinases, stimulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to promote cancer(3). Targeting MEK1/2 is proving to be an important therapeutic strategy, given that a MEK1/2 inhibitor provides a survival advantage in metastatic melanoma(4), an effect that is increased when administered together with a BRAF(V600E) inhibitor(5). We previously found that copper (Cu) influx enhances MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through a Cu-MEK1 interaction(6). Here we show decreasing the levels of CTR1 (Cu transporter 1), or mutations in MEK1 that disrupt Cu binding, decreased BRAF(V600E)-driven signalling and tumorigenesis in mice and human cell settings. Conversely, a MEK1-MEK5 chimaera that phosphorylated ERK1/2 independently of Cu or an active ERK2 restored the tumour growth of murine cells lacking Ctrl1. Cu chelators used in the treatment of Wilson disease(7) decreased tumour growth of human or murine cells transformed by BRAF(V600E) or engineered to be resistant to BRAF inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that Cu-chelation therapy could be repurposed to treat cancers containing the BRAF(V600E) mutation.","[Brady, Donita C.; Crowe, Matthew S.; Turski, Michelle L.; Thiele, Dennis J.; Counter, Christopher M.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Canc Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Hobbs, G.

Critical to these processes is the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC), which regulates immune responses at the interface between the commensal microbiota and the host(1,2). CD1d presents self and microbial lipid antigens to natural killer T (NKT) cells, which are involved in the pathogenesis of colitis in animal models and human inflammatory bowel disease(3-8). As CD1d crosslinking on model IECs results in the production of the important regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 (ref. 9), decreased epithelial CD1d expression-as observed ininflammatory bowel disease(10,11)-may contribute substantially to intestinal inflammation. Here we show in mice that whereas bone-marrow-derived CD1d signals contribute to NKT-cell-mediated intestinal inflammation, engagement of epithelial CD1 delicits protective effects through the activation of STAT3 and STAT3-dependent transcription of IL-10, heat shock protein 110 (HSP110; also known as HSP105), and CD1d itself. All of these epithelial elements are critically involved in controlling CD1d-mediated intestinal inflammation. This is demonstrated by severe NKT-cell-mediated colitis upon IEC-specific deletion of IL-10, CD1d, and its critical regulator microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)(12,13), as well as deletion of HSP110 in the radioresistant compartment. Our studies thus uncover a novel pathway of IEC-dependent regulation of mucosal homeostasis and highlight a critical role of IL-10 in the intestinal epithelium, with broad implications for diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.","[Olszak, Torsten; Neves, Joana F.; Baker, Kristi; Snapper, Scott B.; Zeissig, Sebastian; Blumberg, Richard S.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endoscopy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dowds, C.

Consistent with its importance in the brain, DHA is highly enriched in brain phospholipids(5-7). Despite being an abundant fatty acid in brain phospholipids, DHA cannot be de novo synthesized in brain and must be imported across the blood-brain barrier, but mechanisms for DHA uptake in brain have remained enigmatic. Here we identify a member of the major facilitator superfamily-Mfsd2a (previously an orphan transporter)-as the major transporter for DHA uptake into brain. Mfsd2a is found to be expressed exclusively in endothelium of the blood-brain barrier of micro-vessels. Lipidomic analysis indicates that Mfsd2a-deficient (Mfsd2a-knockout) mice show markedly reduced levels of DHA in brain accompanied by neuronal cell loss in hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as cognitive deficits and severe anxiety, and microcephaly. Unexpectedly, cell-based studies indicate that Mfsd2a transports DHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), but not unesterified fatty acid, in a sodium-dependent manner. Notably, Mfsd2a transports common plasma LPCs carrying long-chain fatty acids such LPC oleate and LPC palmitate, but not LPCs with less than a 14-carbon acyl chain. Moreover, we determine that the phosphor-zwitterionic headgroup of LPC is critical for transport.

This environment is maintained by the 'blood-brain barrier' (BBB), which is composed of blood vessels whose endothelial cells display specialized tight junctions and extremely low rates of transcellular vesicular transport (transcytosis)(1-3). In concert with pericytes and astrocytes, this unique brain endothelial physiological barrier seals the CNS and controls substance influx and efflux(4-6). Although BBB breakdown has recently been associated with initiation and perpetuation of various neurological disorders, an intact BBB is a major obstacle for drug delivery to the CNS7-10. A limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control BBB formation has hindered our ability to manipulate the BBB in disease and therapy. Here we identify mechanisms governing the establishment of a functional BBB. First, using a novel tracer-injection method for embryos, we demonstrate spatiotemporal developmental profiles of BBB functionality and find that the mouse BBB becomes functional at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5). We then screen for BBB-specific genes expressed during BBB formation, and find that major facilitator super family domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a) is selectively expressed in BBB-containing blood vessels in the CNS. Genetic ablation of Mfsd2a results in a leaky BBB from embryonic stages through to adulthood, but the normal patterning of vascular networks is maintained. Electron microscopy examination reveals a dramatic increase in CNS-endothelial-cell vesicular transcytosis in Mfsd2a(-/-) mice, without obvious tight-junction defects. Finally we show that Mfsd2a endothelial expression is regulated by pericytes to facilitate BBB integrity. These findings identify Mfsd2a as a key regulator of BBB function that may act by suppressing transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells. Furthermore, our findings may aid in efforts to develop therapeutic approaches for CNS drug delivery.","[Ben-Zvi, Ayal; Lacoste, Baptiste; Kur, Esther; Andreone, Benjamin J.; Yan, Han; Gu, Chenghua] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mayshar, Yoav] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Gu, CH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",chenghua_gu@hms.harvard.edu,,,Neural Imaging Center as part of an NINDS P30 Core Center grant [NS072030]; Harold Perlman postdoctoral fellowships; Goldenson postdoctoral fellowship; Lefler postdoctoral fellowship; DFG-German Research Foundation postdoctoral fellowship; Mahoney postdoctoral fellowship; NIH training grant [5T32MH20017-15]; Sloan research fellowship; Armenise junior faculty award; Genise Goldenson fund; Freudenberger award; NIH [R01NS064583],"We thank M.

In Gram-negative bacteria, many of these transporters form multicomponent 'pumps' that span both inner and outer membranes and are driven energetically by a primary or secondary transporter component(1-7). A model system for such a pump is the acridine resistance complex of Escherichia Coli(1). This pump assembly comprises the outer-membrane channel TolC, the secondary transporter AcrB located in the inner membrane, and the periplasmic AcrA, which bridges these two integral membrane proteins. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is able to transport vectorially a diverse array of compounds with little chemical similarity, thus conferring resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. Homologous complexes are found in many Gram-negative species, including in animal and plant pathogens. Crystal structures are available for the individual components of the pump(2-7) and have provided insights into substrate recognition, energy coupling and the transduction of conformational changes associated with the transport process. However, how the subunits are organized in the pump, their stoichiometry and the details of their interactions are not known. Here we present the pseudo-atomic structure of a complete multidrug efflux pump in complex with a modulatory protein partner(8) from E. Coli. The model defines the quaternary organization of the pump, identifies key domain interactions, and suggests a cooperative process for channel assembly and opening. These findings illuminate the basis for drug resistance in numerous pathogenic bacterial species.","[Du, Dijun; James, Nathan R.; Voss, Jarrod E.; Klimont, Ewa; Luisi, Ben F.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Wang, Zhao; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ohene-Agyei, Thelma] Dept Pharmacol, Cambridge CB2 1PD, England; [Venter, Henrietta] Univ S Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Sansom Inst Hlth Res, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia","Luisi, BF (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",dd339@cam.ac.uk; bfl20@cam.ac.uk,"wang, zhao/E-1996-2016; Venter, Henrietta/E-4795-2013","Venter, Henrietta/0000-0001-5569-7755; James, Nathan/0000-0003-1147-6285",Wellcome Trust; Human Frontier Science Program; National Institutes of Health [P41GM103832]; Herschel Smith scholarship; Cambridge Trust scholarship; Adam Glinsman award; Faculty for the Future Fellowship from the Schlumberger Foundation,"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust and Human Frontier Science Program (B.

The protein YidC inserts its substrates into the membrane, thereby facilitating membrane protein assembly in bacteria; the homologous proteins Oxa1 and Alb3 have the same function in mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively(1,2). In the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, YidC functions as an independent insertase and a membrane chaperone in cooperation with the translocon SecYEG(3-5). Here we present the crystal structure of YidC from Bacillus halodurans, at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a novel fold, in which five conserved transmembrane helices form a positively charged hydrophilic groove that is open towards both the lipid bilayer and the cytoplasm but closed on the extracellular side. Structure-based in vivo analyses reveal that a conserved arginine residue in the groove is important for the insertion of membrane proteins by YidC. We propose an insertion mechanism for single-spanning membrane proteins, in which the hydrophilic environment generated by the groove recruits the extracellular regions of substrates into the low-dielectric environment of the membrane.","[Kumazaki, Kaoru; Takemoto, Mizuki; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kumazaki, Kaoru; Takemoto, Mizuki; Dohmae, Naoshi; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] RIKEN, Global Res Cluster, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Chiba, Shinobu; Ito, Koreaki] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Fac Life Sci, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Furukawa, Arata; Sugano, Yasunori; Tanaka, Yoshiki; Tsukazaki, Tomoya] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Biol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Nishiyama, Ken-ichi] Iwate Univ, Fac Agr, Cryobiofrontier Res Ctr, Morioka, Iwate 0208550, Japan; [Sugano, Yasunori; Mori, Takaharu; Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN, Theoret Mol Sci Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Hirata, Kunio] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, SR Life Sci Instrumentat Unit, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko] Kyoto Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Maturana, Andres D.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Dept Bioengn Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mori, Hiroyuki] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Arisaka, Fumio] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Tsukazaki, Tomoya] PRESTO, JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",ttsukaza@bs.naist.jp; nureki@bs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Dohmae, Naoshi/C-2040-2011; Sugita, Yuji/L-6726-2014","Sugita, Yuji/0000-0001-9738-9216; Tanaka, Yoshiki/0000-0001-6960-5276; Takemoto, Mizuki/0000-0002-6339-6431","Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics and Structural Life Science by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); JSPS KAKENHI [20247020, 20523517, 24687016, 24102503, 24121704, 24227004, 24657095, 25291006, 25291009, 25660073]; FIRST; PRESTO; JST; MEXT; Private University Strategic Research Foundation Support Program (MEXT); Nagase Science and Technology Foundation; Astellas Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders","We wish to thank K.

However, the presence of a nitrogen atom in a target molecule can complicate its chemical synthesis because of the basicity of nitrogen atoms and their susceptibility to oxidation. Obtaining such compounds by chemical synthesis can be further complicated by the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, but it can be done by the selective introduction and removal of functional groups that mitigate basicity. Here we use such a strategy to complete the chemical syntheses of citrinalin B and cyclopiamine B. The chemical connections that have been realized as a result of these syntheses, in addition to the isolation of both 17-hydroxycitrinalin B and citrinalin C (which contains a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane structural unit) through carbon-13 feeding studies, support the existence of a common bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane-containing biogenetic precursor to these compounds, as has been proposed previously.","[Mercado-Marin, Eduardo V.; Garcia-Reynaga, Pablo; Sarpong, Richmond] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Romminger, Stelamar; Pimenta, Eli F.; Berlinck, Roberto G.

Furthermore, we uncover a subset of galanin-expressing neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) that are specifically activated during male and female parenting, and a different subpopulation that is activated during mating. Genetic ablation of MPOA galanin neurons results in marked impairment of parental responses in males and females and affects male mating. Optogenetic activation of these neurons in virgin males suppresses inter-male and pup-directed aggression and induces pup grooming. Thus, MPOA galanin neurons emerge as an essential regulatory node of male and female parenting behaviour and other social responses.

This classic problem in visual neuroscience has remained unsolved for 50 years. In search of clues, here we reconstruct Off-type starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and bipolar cells (BCs) in serial electron microscopic images with help from EyeWire, an online community of 'citizen neuroscientists'. On the basis of quantitative analyses of contact area and branch depth in the retina, we find evidence that one BC type prefers to wire with a SAC dendrite near the SAC soma, whereas another BC type prefers to wire far from the soma.

In the area beyond the Galactic centre the stars are largely hidden from view by dust, and the kinematic distances of the gas cannot be estimated. Thirty-two possible Cepheid stars (young pulsating variable stars) in the direction of the Galactic bulge were recently identified(3). With their well-calibrated period-luminosity relationships, Cepheid stars are useful distance indicators(4). When observations of these stars are made in two colours, so that their distance and reddening can be determined simultaneously, the problems of dust obscuration are minimized. Here we report that five of the candidates are classical Cepheid stars. These five stars are distributed from approximately one to two kiloparsecs above and below the plane of the Galaxy, at radial distances of about 13 to 22 kiloparsecs from the centre. The presence of these relatively young (less than 130 million years old) stars so far from the Galactic plane is puzzling, unless they are in the flared outer disk. If so, they may be associated with the outer molecular arm(5).","[Feast, Michael W.; Whitelock, Patricia A.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Astron, Astrophys Cosmol & Grav Ctr, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Feast, Michael W.; Menzies, John W.; Whitelock, Patricia A.] S African Astron Observ, ZA-7935 Observatory, South Africa; [Matsunaga, Noriyuki] Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Dept Astron, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Feast, MW (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Astron, Astrophys Cosmol & Grav Ctr, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",mwf@ast.uct.ac.za,,"Whitelock, Patricia/0000-0002-4678-4432; Feast, Michael/0000-0002-8908-1630",South African National Research Foundation,"The observations reported in this Letter were obtained with the Japanese-South African IRSF at Sutherland and the SALT.

But a detailed understanding of such non-equilibrium excited-state dynamics and their interplay with structural changes is challenging: a multitude of excited states and possible transitions result in phenomena too complex to unravel when faced with the indirect sensitivity of optical spectroscopy to spin dynamics(5) and the flux limitations of ultrafast X-ray sources(6,7). Such a situation exists for archetypal poly-pyridyl iron complexes, such as [Fe(2,2'-bipyridine)(3)](2+), where the excited-state charge and spin dynamics involved in the transition from a low-to a high-spin state (spin crossover) have long been a source of interest and controversy(6-15). Here we demonstrate that femtosecond resolution X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, with its sensitivity to spin state, can elucidate the spin crossover dynamics of [Fe(2,2'-bipyridine)(3)](2+) on photoinduced metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitation. We are able to track the charge and spin dynamics, and establish the critical role of intermediate spin states in the crossover mechanism. We anticipate that these capabilities will make our method a valuable tool for mapping in unprecedented detail the fundamental electronic excited-state dynamics that underpin many useful light-triggered molecular phenomena involving 3d transition metal complexes.","[Zhang, Wenkai; Hartsock, Robert W.; Liang, Huiyang W.; Meyer, Drew A.; Purser, Carola; Sun, Zheng; Gaffney, Kelly J.] Stanford Univ, PULSE Inst, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Alonso-Mori, Roberto; Bergmann, Uwe; Chollet, Matthieu; Lemke, Henrik T.; Robinson, Joseph S.; Zhu, Diling] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, LCLS, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Bressler, Christian; Galler, Andreas; Gawelda, Wojciech] European XFEL, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Hadt, Ryan G.; Hartsock, Robert W.; Kroll, Thomas; Liang, Huiyang W.; Meyer, Drew A.; Solomon, Edward I.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kjaer, Kasper S.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Mol Movies, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kjaer, Kasper S.; Nielsen, Martin M.; van Driel, Tim B.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Phys, Ctr Mol Movies, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Kubicek, Katharina] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kubicek, Katharina] DESY, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany; [Solomon, Edward I.; Sokaras, Dimosthenis; Weng, Tsu-Chien] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, SSRL, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Vanko, Gyoergy] Hungarian Acad Sci, Wigner Res Ctr Phys, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary","Gaffney, KJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, PULSE Inst, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kgaffney@slac.stanford.edu,"Zhang, Wenkai/H-1301-2012; Vanko, Gyorgy/B-8176-2012; Kroll, Thomas/D-3636-2009; Bressler, Christian/G-1864-2010; Gawelda, Wojciech/B-7878-2014; Nielsen, Martin/A-5133-2009; Lemke, Henrik Till/N-7419-2016; Gaffney, Kelly/N-1597-2017","Vanko, Gyorgy/0000-0002-3095-6551; Gawelda, Wojciech/0000-0001-7824-9197; Nielsen, Martin/0000-0002-8135-434X; Lemke, Henrik Till/0000-0003-1577-8643; Gaffney, Kelly/0000-0002-0525-6465; Kjaer, Kasper Skov/0000-0002-5580-7851","AMOS programme within the Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, US Department of Energy; NSF [CHE-0948211]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [KR3611/2-1]; Danish National Research Foundation; DANSCATT; Volkswagen Foundation [I/85832]; European Research Council [ERC-StG-259709]; Lendulet Programme of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; DFG [SFB925]; European XFEL","We thank P.

This limits our confidence in evaluating proposed linkages between observed trends in tropical cyclones and in the environment(4,5). Here we mitigate this difficulty by focusing on a metric that is comparatively insensitive to past data uncertainty, and identify a pronounced poleward migration in the average latitude at which tropical cyclones have achieved their lifetime-maximum intensity over the past 30 years. The poleward trends are evident in the global historical data in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres, with rates of 53 and 62 kilometres per decade, respectively, and are statistically significant. When considered together, the trends in each hemisphere depict a global-average migration of tropical cyclone activity away from the tropics at a rate of about one degree of latitude per decade, which lies within the range of estimates of the observed expansion of the tropics over the same period(6). The global migration remains evident and statistically significant under a formal data homogenization procedure(3), and is unlikely to be a data artefact. The migration away from the tropics is apparently linked to marked changes in the mean meridional structure of environmental vertical wind shear and potential intensity, and can plausibly be linked to tropical expansion, which is thought to have anthropogenic contributions(6).","[Kossin, James P.] Univ Wisconsin, NOAA Natl Climat Data Ctr, CIMSS, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Emanuel, Kerry A.] MIT, Program Atmospheres Oceans & Climate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Vecchi, Gabriel A.] NOAA Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Kossin, JP (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, NOAA Natl Climat Data Ctr, CIMSS, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",james.kossin@.noaa.gov,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; Kossin, James/C-2022-2016","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Kossin, James/0000-0003-0461-9794",,,,32,76,77,3,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-May,2014,509,7500,,,,,349,+,,10.1038/nature13278,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AH4TM,WOS:000336121200036,24828193,No,Y,N,11/20/17

For decades, it has been hotly debated whether man-made electric and magnetic fields affect biological processes, including human health(1-5). So far, no putative effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise at intensities below the guidelines adopted by the World Health Organization(1,2) has withstood the test of independent replication under truly blinded experimental conditions. No effect has therefore been widely accepted as scientifically proven(1-6). Here we show that migratory birds are unable to use their magnetic compass in the presence of urban electromagnetic noise. When European robins, Erithacus rubecula, were exposed to the background electromagnetic noise present in unscreened wooden huts at the University of Oldenburg campus, they could not orient using their magnetic compass. Their magnetic orientation capabilities reappeared inelectrically grounded, aluminium-screened huts, which attenuated electromagnetic noise in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz by approximately two orders of magnitude. When the grounding was removed or when broadband electromagnetic noise was deliberately generated inside the screened and grounded huts, the birds again lost their magnetic orientation capabilities. The disruptive effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is not confined to a narrow frequency band and birds tested far from sources of electromagnetic noise required no screening to orient with their magnetic compass. These fully double-blinded tests document a reproducible effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise on the behaviour of an intact vertebrate.","[Engels, Svenja; Schneider, Nils-Lasse; Lefeldt, Nele; Hein, Christine Maira; Zapka, Manuela; Michalik, Andreas; Elbers, Dana; Mouritsen, Henrik] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Biol & Umweltwissensch, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Engels, Svenja; Schneider, Nils-Lasse; Lefeldt, Nele; Hein, Christine Maira; Zapka, Manuela; Michalik, Andreas; Elbers, Dana; Mouritsen, Henrik] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Res Ctr Neurosensory Sci, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Kittel, Achim] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Phys, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Hore, P.

The HMP Consortium has reported the structure and function of the human microbiome in 300 healthy adults at 18 body sites from a single time point(2,3). Using additional data collected over the course of 12-18 months, we used Dirichlet multinomial mixture models(4) to partition the data into community types for each body site and made three important observations. First, there were strong associations between whether individuals had been breastfed as an infant, their gender, and their level of education with their community types at several body sites. Second, although the specific taxonomic compositions of the oral and gut microbiomes were different, the community types observed at these sites were predictive of each other. Finally, over the course of the sampling period, the community types from sites within the oral cavity were the least stable, whereas those in the vagina and gut were the most stable. Our results demonstrate that even with the considerable intra-and interpersonal variation in the human microbiome, this variation can be partitioned into community types that are predictive of each other and are probably the result of life-history characteristics. Understanding the diversity of community types and the mechanisms that result in an individual having a particular type or changing types, will allow us to use their community types to assess disease risk and to personalize therapies.","[Ding, Tao; Schloss, Patrick D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Schloss, PD (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, 1500 W Med Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",pschloss@umich.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01HG005975, R01GM099514, P30DK034933]","We thank J.

Riboflavin precursors found in many bacteria and yeast also selectively activate mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells(5,6), an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans(7-9). However, the genesis of these small organic molecules and their mode of presentation to MAIT cells by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein MR1 (ref. 8) are not well understood. Here we show that MAIT-cell activation requires key genes encoding enzymes that form 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU), an early intermediate in bacterial riboflavin synthesis. Although 5-A-RU does not bind MR1 or activate MAIT cells directly, it does form potent MAIT-activating antigens via non-enzymatic reactions with small molecules, such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which are derived from other metabolic pathways. The MAIT antigens formed by the reactions between 5-A-RU and glyoxal/methylglyoxal were simple adducts, 5-(2-oxoethylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OE-RU) and 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), respectively, which bound to MR1 as shown by crystal structures of MAIT TCR ternary complexes. Although 5-OP-RU and 5-OE-RU are unstable intermediates, they became trapped by MR1 as reversible covalent Schiff base complexes. Mass spectra supported the capture by MR1 of 5-OP-RU and 5-OE-RU from bacterial cultures that activate MAIT cells, but not from non-activating bacteria, indicating that these MAIT antigens are present in a range of microbes.

In mouse macrophages, activation of this pathway requires the production of type-I interferons(4,5), indicating that interferon-induced genes have a critical role in initiating this pathway. Here we report that a cluster of small interferon-inducible GTPases, the so-called guanylate-binding proteins, is required for the full activity of the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome during infections with vacuolar Gram-negative bacteria. We show that guanylate-binding proteins are recruited to intracellular bacterial pathogens and are necessary to induce the lysis of the pathogen-containing vacuole. Lysis of the vacuole releases bacteria into the cytosol, thus allowing the detection of their lipopolysaccharide by a yet unknown lipopolysaccharide sensor. Moreover, recognition of the lysed vacuole by the danger sensor galectin-8 initiates the uptake of bacteria into autophagosomes, which results in a reduction of caspase-11 activation. These results indicate that host-mediated lysis of pathogen-containing vacuoles is an essential immune function and is necessary for efficient recognition of pathogens by inflammasome complexes in the cytosol.","[Meunier, Etienne; Dick, Mathias S.; Dreier, Roland F.; Schuermann, Nura; Bumann, Dirk; Broz, Petr] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Focal Area Infect Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Broz, Daniela Kenzelmann] Univ Basel, Dept Biomed, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Warming, Soren; Roose-Girma, Merone; Kayagaki, Nobuhiko] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Takeda, Kiyoshi; Yamamoto, Masahiro] Osaka Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Broz, P (reprint author), Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Focal Area Infect Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",petr.broz@unibas.ch,,"Dick, Mathias/0000-0002-4070-9749; Broz, Petr/0000-0002-2334-7790",SNSF [PP00P3_139120/1]; University of Basel [ID2153162]; Marie Heim-Voegtlin Fellowship [145516],"We thank N.

Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers(1-3) and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations(1-5). Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.","[Treutlein, Barbara; Wu, Angela R.; Neff, Norma F.; Mantalas, Gary L.; Quake, Stephen R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Treutlein, Barbara; Wu, Angela R.; Neff, Norma F.; Mantalas, Gary L.; Quake, Stephen R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Treutlein, Barbara; Brownfield, Doug G.; Wu, Angela R.; Neff, Norma F.; Mantalas, Gary L.; Espinoza, F.

Genetic disruption of lignin biosynthesis has been proposed as a means to improve forage and bioenergy crops, but frequently results in stunted growth and developmental abnormalities, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood(3). Here we show that the phenotype of a lignin-deficient Arabidopsis mutant is dependent on the transcriptional co-regulatory complex, Mediator. Disruption of the Mediator complex subunits MED5a (also known as REF4) and MED5b (also known as RFR1) rescues the stunted growth, lignin deficiency and widespread changes in gene expression seen in the phenylpropanoid pathway mutant ref8, without restoring the synthesis of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin subunits. Cell walls of rescued med5a/5b ref8 plants instead contain a novel lignin consisting almost exclusively of p-hydroxyphenyl lignin subunits, and moreover exhibit substantially facilitated polysaccharide saccharification. These results demonstrate that guaiacyl and syringyl lignin subunits are largely dispensable for normal growth and development, implicate Mediator in an active transcriptional process responsible for dwarfing and inhibition of lignin biosynthesis, and suggest that the transcription machinery and signalling pathways responding to cell wall defects may be important targets to include in efforts to reduce biomass recalcitrance.","[Bonawitz, Nicholas D.; Kim, Jeong Im; Anderson, Nickolas A.; Maeda, Junko; Chapple, Clint] Purdue Univ, Dept Biochem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tobimatsu, Yuki; Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ciesielski, Peter N.; Donohoe, Bryon S.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Ximenes, Eduardo; Ladisch, Michael] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ximenes, Eduardo; Ladisch, Michael] Purdue Univ, Renewable Resources Engn Lab, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Energy Inst, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Ladisch, Michael] Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Chapple, C (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biochem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",chapple@purdue.edu,"Chapple, Clint/Q-5456-2017","Chapple, Clint/0000-0002-5195-562X; Ximenes, Eduardo/0000-0001-9087-0218","Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-07ER15905]; Life Sciences Research Foundation; US DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE BER Office of Science) [DE-FC02-07ER64944]; Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels (C3Bio), an Energy Frontier Research Center - US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0000997]; US DOE [DE-FG02-06ER64301]; Purdue University Office of Agricultural Research Programs; Bioinformatics Core at Purdue University","This work was primarily funded by the Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy (DOE) through grant DE-FG02-07ER15905 to C.

HCV infection often results in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. No vaccine is available and current therapies are effective against some, but not all, genotypes. HCV is an enveloped virus with two surface glycoproteins (E1 and E2). E2 binds to the host cell through interactions with scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and CD81, and serves as a target for neutralizing antibodies(2-4). Little is known about the molecular mechanism that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion, although E2 is predicted to be a class II viral fusion protein. Here we describe the structure of the E2 core domain in complex with an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The E2 core has a compact, globular domain structure, consisting mostly of beta-strands and random coil with two small alpha-helices. The strands are arranged in two, perpendicular sheets (A and B), which are held together by an extensive hydrophobic core and disulphide bonds. Sheet A has an IgG-like fold that is commonly found in viral and cellular proteins, whereas sheet B represents a novel fold. Solution-based studies demonstrate that the full-length E2 ectodomain has a similar globular architecture and does not undergo significant conformational or oligomeric rearrangements on exposure to low pH. Thus, the IgG-like fold is the only feature that E2 shares with class II membrane fusion proteins. These results provide unprecedented insights into HCV entry and will assist in developing an HCV vaccine and new inhibitors.","[Khan, Abdul Ghafoor; Whidby, Jillian; Miller, Matthew T.; Zatorski, Alexandra V.; Cygan, Alicja; Yost, Samantha A.; Marcotrigiano, Joseph] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Scarborough, Hannah; Price, Aryn A.; Bohannon, Caitlin D.; Jacob, Joshy; Grakoui, Arash] Emory Univ, Div Microbiol & Immunol, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Grakoui, Arash] Emory Univ, Div Infect Dis, Dept Med, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Marcotrigiano, J (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, 679 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",arash.grakoui@emory.edu; jmarco@cabm.rutgers.edu,"Marcotrigiano, Joseph /K-6697-2016; Khan, Abdul/P-1569-2016","Marcotrigiano, Joseph /0000-0003-0346-3353; Khan, Abdul/0000-0001-8600-8254; Yost, Samantha/0000-0002-8286-2530","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886]; Yerkes Research Center Base Grant [RR-00165]; NIH [P50 GM103368, R01 AI080659, AI070101, DK083356]; New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research [DFHS13CRP001]","We acknowledge access to the X25 beamline at NSLS and thank the NSLS staff.

In vitro, the alphabet has been expanded to include several unnatural base pairs (UBPs)(1-3). We have developed a class of UBPs formed between nucleotides bearing hydrophobic nucleobases, exemplified by the pair formed between d5SICS and dNaM (d5SICS-dNaM), which is efficiently PCR-amplified(1) and transcribed(4,5) in vitro, and whose unique mechanism of replication has been characterized(6,7). However, expansion of an organism's genetic alphabet presents new and unprecedented challenges: the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates must be available inside the cell; endogenous polymerases must be able to use the unnatural triphosphates to faithfully replicate DNA containing the UBP within the complex cellular milieu; and finally, the UBP must be stable in the presence of pathways that maintain the integrity of DNA. Here we show that an exogenously expressed algal nucleotide triphosphate transporter efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICS and dNaM (d5SICSTP and dNaMTP) into Escherichia coli, and that the endogenous replication machinery uses them to accurately replicate a plasmid containing d5SICS-dNaM. Neither the presence of the unnatural triphosphates nor the replication of the UBP introduces a notable growth burden. Lastly, we find that the UBP is not efficiently excised by DNA repair pathways. Thus, the resulting bacterium is the first organism to propagate stably an expanded genetic alphabet.","[Malyshev, Denis A.; Dhami, Kirandeep; Lavergne, Thomas; Chen, Tingjian; Romesberg, Floyd E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Dai, Nan; Foster, Jeremy M.; Correa, Ivan R., Jr.] New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA","Romesberg, FE (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",floyd@scripps.edu,"Chen, Tingjian/L-2659-2013; Dai, Nan/I-5950-2013; LAVERGNE, Thomas/N-8896-2013; Romesberg, Floyd/M-2821-2017","Chen, Tingjian/0000-0002-4458-4269; LAVERGNE, Thomas/0000-0002-0029-0015; Romesberg, Floyd/0000-0001-6317-1315",US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM 060005],"We thank I.

The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these benefits remain largely undetermined, despite offering the potential to reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Substantial changes in circulating total bile acids are known to occur after VSG. Moreover, bile acids are known to regulate metabolism by binding to the nuclear receptor FXR (farsenoid-X receptor, also known as NR1H4). We therefore examined the results of VSG surgery applied to mice with diet-induced obesity and targeted genetic disruption of FXR. Here we demonstrate that the therapeutic value of VSG does not result from mechanical restriction imposed by a smaller stomach. Rather, VSG is associated with increased circulating bile acids, and associated changes to gut microbial communities. Moreover, in the absence of FXR, the ability of VSG to reduce body weight and improve glucose tolerance is substantially reduced. These results point to bile acids and FXR signalling as an important molecular underpinning for the beneficial effects of this weight-loss surgery.","[Ryan, Karen K.; Clemmensen, Christoffer; Wilson-Perez, Hilary E.; Sandoval, Darleen A.; Seeley, Randy J.] Univ Cincinnati, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Internal Med, Cincinnati, OH 45237 USA; [Tremaroli, Valentina; Kovatcheva-Datchary, Petia; Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Mol & Clin Med, Wallenberg Lab, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tremaroli, Valentina; Kovatcheva-Datchary, Petia; Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Ctr Cardiovasc & Metab Res, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Clemmensen, Christoffer] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Drug Design & Pharmacol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Myronovych, Andriy; Kohli, Rohit] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Dept Pediat, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Karns, Rebekah] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Biomed Informat, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Copenhagen, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Sect Metab Receptol & Enteroendocrinol, Fac Hlth Sci, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Seeley, RJ (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Internal Med, Cincinnati, OH 45237 USA.",randy.seeley@uc.edu,"Clemmensen, Christoffer/N-4680-2017","Clemmensen, Christoffer/0000-0003-2456-9667; Ryan, Karen/0000-0003-4563-3744; Backhed, Fredrik/0000-0002-4871-8818; kohli, Rohit/0000-0002-0198-7703; Seeley, Randy/0000-0002-3721-5625","UNIK Food Fitness and Pharma for Health and Disease research programme; Torsten Soderberg foundation; NovoNordisk foundation; Ethicon Endo-Surgery; NIH [DK082173, HL111319, DK093848]; NIH (Bioinformatics Core of the Digestive Disease Research Core Center in Cincinnati) [DK078392]","We thank J.

Although they are allocated to spatially distinct regional domains during development, it is unknown whether region-restricted astrocytes are functionally heterogeneous. Here we show that postnatal spinal cord astrocytes express several region-specific genes, and that ventral astrocyte-encoded semaphorin 3a (Sema3a) is required for proper motor neuron and sensory neuron circuit organization. Loss of astrocyte-encoded Sema3a leads to dysregulated alpha-motor neuron axon initial segment orientation, markedly abnormal synaptic inputs, and selective death of alpha- but not of adjacent gamma-motor neurons. In addition, a subset of TrkA(+) sensory afferents projects to ectopic ventral positions. These findings demonstrate that stable maintenance of a positional cue by developing astrocytes influences multiple aspects of sensorimotor circuit formation. More generally, they suggest that regional astrocyte heterogeneity may help to coordinate postnatal neural circuit refinement.","[Molofsky, Anna V.; Kelley, Kevin W.; Tsai, Hui-Hsin; Chang, Sandra M.; Rowitch, David H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Molofsky, Anna V.; Kelley, Kevin W.; Tsai, Hui-Hsin; Chang, Sandra M.; Rowitch, David H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Molofsky, Anna V.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kelley, Kevin W.; Tsai, Hui-Hsin; Rowitch, David H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kelley, Kevin W.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Med Scientist Training Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kelley, Kevin W.; Redmond, Stephanie A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Neurosci Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Redmond, Stephanie A.; Madireddy, Lohith; Chan, Jonah R.; Baranzini, Sergio E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ullian, Erik M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Ophthalmol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Rowitch, David H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurosurg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Rowitch, DH (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",rowitchd@peds.ucsf.edu,,"Redmond, Stephanie/0000-0002-5580-6269","NIMH [5T32MH089920-04, R01MH099595-01]; APA/Pfizer MD/PhD Psychiatric Research Fellowship; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [TG2-01153]; Ruth L.

Here we show that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule H2-D-b is necessary and sufficient for synapse elimination in the retinogeniculate system. In mice lacking both H2-K-b and H2-D-b ((KDb-/-)-D-b), despite intact retinal activity and basal synaptic transmission, the developmentally regulated decrease in functional convergence of retinal ganglion cell synaptic inputs to LGN neurons fails and eye-specific layers do not form. Neuronal expression of just H2-Db in (KDb-/-)-D-b mice rescues both synapse elimination and eye-specific segregation despite a compromised immune system. When patterns of stimulation mimicking endogenous retinal waves are used to probe synaptic learning rules at retinogeniculate synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP) is intact but long-term depression (LTD) is impaired in (KDb-/-)-D-b mice. This change is due to an increase in Ca2+-permeable AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors. Restoring H2-D-b to (KDb-/-)-D-b neurons renders AMPA receptors Ca2+ impermeable and rescues LTD. These observations reveal an MHC-class-I-mediated link between developmental synapse pruning and balanced synaptic learning rules enabling both LTD and LTP, and demonstrate a direct requirement for H2-D-b in functional and structural synapse pruning in CNS neurons.","[Lee, Hanmi; Brott, Barbara K.; Adelson, Jaimie D.; Cheng, Sarah; Datwani, Akash; Shatz, Carla J.] James H Clark Ctr, Dept Biol & Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lee, Hanmi; Brott, Barbara K.; Adelson, Jaimie D.; Cheng, Sarah; Datwani, Akash; Shatz, Carla J.] James H Clark Ctr, Dept BioX, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kirkby, Lowry A.; Feller, Marla B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kirkby, Lowry A.; Feller, Marla B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Shatz, CJ (reprint author), James H Clark Ctr, Dept Biol & Neurobiol, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",cshatz@stanford.edu,,"Adelson, Jaimie/0000-0003-2397-4070","NIH [R01 MH071666, EY02858, RO1 EY13528]; G.

Bright afterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium. Afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet when measured minutes after the burst, and it probes the geometric properties of the jet and the ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst(1-5). High values of optical polarization detected minutes after the burst of GRB 120308A indicate the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the central engine(5) (the power source of the GRB). Theoretical models predict low degrees of linear polarization and no circular polarization at late times(6-8), when the energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient medium and propagates farther into the medium as a blast wave. Here we report the detection of circularly polarized light in the afterglow of GRB 121024A, measured 0.15 days after the burst. We show that the circular polarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dust scattering or plasma propagation effects. A possible explanation is to invoke anisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch-angle distributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce the complex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets(9-11).","[Wiersema, K.; Starling, R.

There are a variety of views on how best to describe the onset of dry frictional motion. These range from modelling friction with a single degree of freedom, a 'friction coefficient'(3,5), to theoretical treatments using dynamic fracture(5-8) to account for spatial and temporal dynamics along the interface. We investigated the onset of dry frictional motion by performing simultaneous high-speed measurements of the real contact area and the strain fields in the region surrounding propagating rupture tips within the dry (nominally flat) rough interfaces formed by brittle polymer blocks. Here we show that the transition from 'static' to 'dynamic' friction is quantitatively described by classical singular solutions for the motion of a rapid shear crack(5,9-13). We find that these singular solutions, originally derived to describe brittle fracture, are in excellent agreement with the experiments for slow propagation, whereas some significant discrepancies arise as the rupture velocity approaches the Rayleigh wave speed. In addition, the energy dissipated in the fracture of the contacts remains nearly constant throughout the entire range in which the rupture velocity is less than the Rayleigh wave speed, whereas the size of the dissipative zone undergoes a Lorentz-like contraction as the rupture velocity approaches the Rayleigh wave speed. This coupling between friction and fracture is critical to our fundamental understanding of frictional motion and related processes, such as earthquake dynamics.","[Svetlizky, Ilya; Fineberg, Jay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Fineberg, J (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",jay@mail.huji.ac.il,,,James S.

The Arctic warming exceeds the global average warming because of feedbacks that include sea-ice reduction(4,5) and other dynamical and radiative feedbacks(6-13). We find that the most prominent annual mean surface and tropospheric warming in the Arctic since 1979 has occurred in northeastern Canada and Greenland. In this region, much of the year-to-year temperature variability is associated with the leading mode of large-scale circulation variability in the North Atlantic, namely, the North Atlantic Oscillation(14,15). Here we show that the recent warming in this region is strongly associated with a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation, which is a response to anomalous Rossby wave-train activity originating in the tropical Pacific. Atmospheric model experiments forced by prescribed tropical sea surface temperatures simulate the observed circulation changes and associated tropospheric and surface warming over northeastern Canada and Greenland. Experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (ref. 16) models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing show no similar circulation changes related to the North Atlantic Oscillation or associated tropospheric warming. This suggests that a substantial portion of recent warming in the northeastern Canada and Greenland sector of the Arctic arises from unforced natural variability.","[Ding, Qinghua; Steig, Eric J.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ding, Qinghua; Steig, Eric J.] Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Wallace, John M.; Battisti, David S.; Geng, Lei] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gallant, Ailie J.

The default strategy for conserving biodiversity is the designation of nature reserves, treated as islands in an inhospitable sea of human activity(5). Despite the profound influence of islands on conservation theory and practice(3,4), their mainland analogues, forest fragments in human-dominated landscapes, consistently defy expected biodiversity patterns based on island biogeography theory(6-13). Countryside biogeography is an alternative framework, which recognizes that the fate of the world's wildlife will be decided largely by the hospitality of agricultural or countryside ecosystems(12,14-17). Here we directly test these biogeographic theories by comparing a Neotropical countryside ecosystem with a nearby island ecosystem, and show that each supports similar bat biodiversity in fundamentally different ways. The island ecosystem conforms to island biogeographic predictions of bat species loss, in which the water matrix is not habitat. In contrast, the countryside ecosystem has high species richness and evenness across forest reserves and smaller forest fragments. Relative to forest reserves and fragments, deforested countryside habitat supports a less species-rich, yet equally even, bat assemblage. Moreover, the bat assemblage associated with deforested habitat is compositionally novel because of predictable changes in abundances by many species using human-made habitat. Finally, we perform a global meta-analysis of bat biogeographic studies, spanning more than 700 species. It generalizes our findings, showing that separate biogeographic theories for countryside and island ecosystems are necessary. A theory of countryside biogeography is essential to conservation strategy in the agricultural ecosystems that comprise roughly half of the global land surface and are likely to increase even further(14).","[Mendenhall, Chase D.; Karp, Daniel S.; Daily, Gretchen C.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mendenhall, Chase D.; Karp, Daniel S.; Hadly, Elizabeth A.; Daily, Gretchen C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Karp, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Karp, Daniel S.] Nature Conservancy, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Meyer, Christoph F.

Decomposition is driven by a vast diversity of organisms that are structured in complex food webs(2,4). Identifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity on decomposition is critical(4-6) given the rapid loss of species worldwide and the effects of this loss on human well-being(7-9). Yet despite comprehensive syntheses of studies on how biodiversity affects litter decomposition(4-6,10), key questions remain, including when, where and how biodiversity has a role and whether general patterns and mechanisms occur across ecosystems and different functional types of organism(4,9-12). Here, in field experiments across five terrestrial and aquatic locations, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics, we show that reducing the functional diversity of decomposer organisms and plant litter types slowed the cycling of litter carbon and nitrogen. Moreover, we found evidence of nitrogen transfer from the litter of nitrogen-fixing plants to that of rapidly decomposing plants, but not between other plant functional types, highlighting that specific interactions in litter mixtures control carbon and nitrogen cycling during decomposition. The emergence of this general mechanism and the coherence of patterns across contrasting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems suggest that biodiversity loss has consistent consequences for litter decomposition and the cycling of major elements on broad spatial scales.","[Handa, I.

Speciation relies on cycling through these three steps and each may limit the rate at which new species form(1,3). We estimate phylogenetic relationships among all Himalayan songbirds to ask whether the development of reproductive isolation and ecological competition, both factors that limit range expansions(4), set an ultimate limit on speciation. Based on a phylogeny for all 358 species distributed along the eastern elevational gradient, here we show that body size and shape differences evolved early in the radiation, with the elevational band occupied by a species evolving later. These results are consistent with competition for niche space limiting species accumulation(5). Even the elevation dimension seems to be approaching ecological saturation, because the closest relatives both inside the assemblage and elsewhere in the Himalayas are on average separated by more than five million years, which is longer than it generally takes for reproductive isolation to be completed(2,3,6); also, elevational distributions are well explained by resource availability, notably the abundance of arthropods, and not by differences in diversification rates in different elevational zones. Our results imply that speciation rate is ultimately set by niche filling(that is, ecological competition for resources), rather than by the rate of acquisition of reproductive isolation.","[Price, Trevor D.; Hooper, Daniel M.; Buchanan, Caitlyn D.; Johansson, Ulf S.; Tietze, D.

To explain this variability, the cortex of alert animals has been proposed to be in an asynchronous high-conductance state in which irregular spiking arises from the convergence of large numbers of uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto individual neurons(1-4). Signatures of this state are that a neuron's membrane potential (V-m) hovers just below spike threshold, and its aggregate synaptic input is nearly Gaussian, arising from many uncorrelated inputs(1-4). Alternatively, irregular spiking could arise from infrequent correlated input events that elicit large fluctuations in V-m (refs 5, 6). To distinguish between these hypotheses, we developed a technique to perform whole-cell V-m measurements from the cortex of behaving monkeys, focusing on primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a visual fixation task. Here we show that, contrary to the predictions of an asynchronous state, mean V-m during fixation was far from threshold (14 mV) and spiking was triggered by occasional large spontaneous fluctuations. Distributions of V-m values were skewed beyond that expected for a range of Gaussian input(6,7), but were consistent with synaptic input arising from infrequent correlated events(5,6). Furthermore, spontaneous fluctuations in V-m were correlated with the surrounding network activity, as reflected in simultaneously recorded nearby local field potential. Visual stimulation, however, led to responses more consistent with an asynchronous state: mean V-m approached threshold, fluctuations became more Gaussian, and correlations between single neurons and the surrounding network were disrupted. These observations show that sensory drive can shift a common cortical circuitry from a synchronous to an asynchronous state.","[Tan, Andrew Y.

Efferocytosis is mediated, in part, by receptors that bind to exofacial phosphatidylserine (PS) on cells or cellular debris after loss of plasma membrane asymmetry. Here we show that a bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, can exploit efferocytosis to promote cell-to-cell spread during infection. These bacteria can escape the phagosome in host cells by using the poreforming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) and two phospholipase C enzymes(2). Expression of the cell surface protein ActA allows L. monocytogenes to activate host actin regulatory factors and undergo actin-based motility in the cytosol, eventually leading to formation of actin-rich protrusions at the cell surface. Here we show that protrusion formation is associated with plasma membrane damage due to LLO's poreforming activity. LLO also promotes the release of bacteria-containing protrusions from the host cell, generating membrane-derived vesicles with exofacial PS. The PS-binding receptor TIM-4 (encoded by the Timd4 gene) contributes to efficient cell-to-cell spread by L. monocytogenes in macrophages in vitro and growth of these bacteria is impaired in Timd4(-/-) mice. Thus, L. monocytogenes promotes its dissemination in a host by exploiting efferocytosis. Our results indicate that PS-targeted therapeutics may be useful in the fight against infections by L. monocytogenes and other bacteria that use similar strategies of cell-to-cell spread during infection.","[Czuczman, Mark A.; Fattouh, Ramzi; Canadien, Veronica; Osborne, Suzanne; Muise, Aleixo M.; Brumell, John H.] Hosp Sick Children, Cell Biol Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Czuczman, Mark A.; Brumell, John H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [van Rijn, Jorik M.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Rijn, Jorik M.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Inst Biomembranes, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands; [Muise, Aleixo M.] Hosp Sick Children, Dept Paediat, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Muise, Aleixo M.; Brumell, John H.] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Muise, Aleixo M.; Brumell, John H.] Hosp Sick Children, Sickkids IBD Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Higgins, Darren E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Brumell, JH (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Cell Biol Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.",john.brumell@sickkids.ca,,"van Rijn, Jorik/0000-0003-2865-4455",Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Innovation Trust; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canadian Association of Gastroenterology; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada; Research Training Committee at the Hospital for Sick Children; Arthritis Society of Canada [RG11/013]; US Public Health Service grant from the National Institutes of Health [AI053669],"We are grateful to S.

Individuals with defective ROS production machinery develop chronic granulomatous disease(1,2). Conversely, excessive ROS can cause collateral tissue damage during inflammatory processes and therefore needs to be tightly regulated. Here we describe a protein, we termed negative regulator of ROS (NRROS), which limits ROS generation by phagocytes during inflammatory responses. NRROS expression in phagocytes can be repressed by inflammatory signals. NRROS-deficient phagocytes produce increased ROS upon inflammatory challenges, and mice lacking NRROS in their phagocytes show enhanced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Conversely, these mice develop severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis owing to oxidative tissue damage in the central nervous system. Mechanistically, NRROS is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it directly interactswith nascent NOX2 (also known as gp91(phox) and encoded by Cybb) monomer, one of the membrane-bound subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex, and facilitates the degradation of NOX2 through the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Thus, NRROS provides a hitherto undefined mechanism for regulating ROS prodution-one that enables phagocytes to produce higher amounts of ROS, if required to control invading pathogens, while minimizing unwanted collateral tissue damage.","[Noubade, Rajkumar; Wong, Kit; Ota, Naruhisa; Rutz, Sascha; Eidenschenk, Celine; Valdez, Patricia A.; Ding, Jiabing; Peng, Ivan; DeVoss, Jason; Lu, Rongze; Ouyang, Wenjun] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Sebrell, Andrew; Sai, Tao] Genentech Inc, Dept Antibody Engn, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Caplazi, Patrick] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Soriano, Robert H.; Modrusan, Zora] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Hackney, Jason] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ouyang, WJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",ouyang.wenjun@gene.com,"Lu, Rongze/R-2149-2016","Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864; Caplazi, Patrick/0000-0002-3411-1257; Hackney, Jason/0000-0002-5922-563X",,,,38,52,54,1,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-May,2014,509,7499,,,,,235,+,,10.1038/nature13152,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AG5JC,WOS:000335454300041,24739962,No,,,11/20/17

TLRs are membrane receptors that survey the extracellular environment for microbial infections, whereas NLRs are cytosolic complexes that detect microbial products that reach the cytosol. Upon detection, both sensor classes trigger innate inflammatory responses and allow the engagement of adaptive immunity(1,2). Endo-lysosomes are the entry sites for a variety of pathogens, and therefore the sites at which the immune system first senses their presence. Pathogens internalized by endocytosis are well known to activate TLRs 3 and 7-9 that are localized to endocytic compartments and detect ligands present in the endosomal lumen(3). Internalized pathogens also activate sensors in the cytosol such as NOD1 and NOD2 (ref. 2), indicating that endosomes also provide for the translocation of bacterial components across the endosomal membrane. Despite the fact that NOD2 is well understood to have a key role in regulating innate immune responses and that mutations at the NOD2 locus are a common risk factor in inflammatory bowel disease and possibly other chronic inflammatory states(4,5), little is known about how its ligands escape from endosomes. Here we show that two endo-lysosomal peptide transporters, SLC15A3 and SLC15A4, are preferentially expressed by dendritic cells, especially after TLR stimulation. The transporters mediate the egress of bacterially derived components, such as the NOD2 cognate ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP)(6,7), and are selectively required for NOD2 responses to endosomally derived MDP. Enhanced expression of the transporters also generates endosomal membrane tubules characteristic of dendritic cells, which further enhanced the NOD2-dependent response to MDP. Finally, sensing required the recruitment of NOD2 and its effector kinase RIPK2 (refs 8, 9) to the endosomal membrane, possibly by forming a complex with SLC15A3 or SLC15A4. Thus, dendritic cell endosomes are specialized platforms for both the lumenal and cytosolic sensing of pathogens.","[Nakamura, Norihiro; Lill, Jennie R.; Phung, Qui; Jiang, Zhaoshi; Bakalarski, Corey; Schlatter, Megan; Delamarre, Lelia; Mellman, Ira] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [de Maziere, Ann; Klumperman, Judith] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands","Mellman, I (reprint author), Genentech Inc, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",mellman.ira@gene.com,,"Bakalarski, Corey/0000-0003-1085-7828",Genentech,"The authors thank Mellman laboratory members for discussions, C.

Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi(1-9). Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain(10,11). Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state(12-18) and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore(19-23). However, the structure of the signalling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive. Here we report crystal and solution structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans. The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, respectively. This nanometre-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved 'tongue', which is in contact with the chromophore. The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which atomic-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into ana angstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometre-scale conformational signal. The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signalling network.","[Takala, Heikki; Lehtivuori, Heli; Ihalainen, Janne A.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Nanosci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Westenhoff, Sebastian] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem & Mol Biol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Ihalainen, JA (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Nanosci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",janne.ihalainen@jyu.fi; westenho@chem.gu.se,,"Takala, Heikki/0000-0003-2518-8583; Hoernke, Maria/0000-0003-2008-411X; Lehtivuori, Heli/0000-0002-7450-2578; Menzel, Andreas/0000-0002-0489-609X; Niebling, Stephan/0000-0001-6582-5984","European Community [312284 CALIPSO]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [1R24GM111072]; Foundation of Strategic Research, Sweden; Swedish Research Council [279944]; European Research Council [279944]; Finnish Academy [138063]; Finnish Cultural Foundation [0131067]","We acknowledge beamline access at BM29 and ID23-1 at the ESRF, cSAXS at the Swiss Light Source (funded by the European Community's FP7 grant agreement no. 312284 CALIPSO), and BioCARS at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (supported by National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant 1R24GM111072 and in part through collaboration with P.

One specialized set of spinal GABAergic interneurons forms axo-axonic contacts with the central terminals of sensory afferents, exerting presynaptic inhibitory control over sensory-motor transmission. The inability to achieve selective access to the GABAergic neurons responsible for this unorthodox inhibitory mechanism has left unresolved the contribution of presynaptic inhibition to motor behaviour. We used Gad2 as a genetic entry point to manipulate the interneurons that contact sensory terminals, and show that activation of these interneurons in mice elicits the defining physiological characteristics of presynaptic inhibition. Selective genetic ablation of Gad2-expressing interneurons severely perturbs goal-directed reaching movements, uncovering a pronounced and stereotypic forelimb motor oscillation, the core features of which are captured by modelling the consequences of sensory feedback at high gain. Our findings define the neural substrate of a genetically hardwired gain control system crucial for the smooth execution of movement.","[Fink, Andrew J.

We found that the amount of protein synthesized per hour in HSCs in vivo was lower than in most other haematopoietic cells, even if we controlled for differences in cell cycle status or forced HSCs to undergo self-renewing divisions. Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24(Bst/+) mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24(Bst/+) cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.","[Signer, Robert A.

Twelve somatically related neutralizing antibodies (CAP256-VRC26.01-12) were isolated from donor CAP256 (from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA)); each antibody contained the protruding tyrosine-sulphated, anionic antigen-binding loop (complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3) characteristic of this category of antibodies. Their unmutated ancestor emerged between weeks 30-38 post-infection with a 35-residue CDR H3, and neutralized the virus that superinfected this individual 15 weeks after initial infection. Improved neutralization breadth and potency occurred by week 59 with modest affinity maturation, and was preceded by extensive diversification of the virus population.

In the Solar System, the equatorial rotation velocities and, consequently, spin angular momenta of most of the planets increase with planetary mass(4); the exceptions to this trend are Mercury and Venus, which, since formation, have significantly spun down because of tidal interactions(5,6). Here we report near-infrared spectroscopic observations, at a resolving power of 100,000, of the young extrasolar gas giant planet beta Pictoris b (refs 7, 8). The absorption signal from carbon monoxide in the planet's thermal spectrum is found to be blueshifted with respect to that from the parent star by approximately 15 kilometres per second, consistent with a circular orbit(9). The combined line profile exhibits a rotational broadening of about 25 kilometres per second, meaning that beta Pictoris b spins significantly faster than any planet in the Solar System, in line with the extrapolation of the known trend in spin velocity with planet mass.","[Snellen, Ignas A.

Two key parameters are crucial for the single-photon source: a high photon flux with a very small bandwidth, and a spectral match to other components of the system. Atoms or ions may act as single-photon sources-owing to their narrow-band emission and their intrinsic spectral match to other atomic systems-and can serve as quantum nonlinear elements. Unfortunately, their emission rates are still limited, even for highly efficient cavity designs(2). Single solid-state emitters such as single organic dye molecules are significantly brighter(3) and allow for narrowband photons(4); they have shown potential in a variety of quantum optical experiments(5,6) but have yet to be interfaced with other components such as stationary memory qubits. Here we describe the optical interaction between Fourier-limited photons from a single organic molecule and atomic alkali vapours, which can constitute an efficient quantum memory. Single-photon emission rates reach up to several hundred thousand counts per second and show a high spectral brightness of 30,000 detectable photons per second per megahertz of bandwidth. The molecular emission is robust and we demonstrate perfect tuning to the spectral transitions of the sodium D line and efficient filtering, even for emitters at ambient conditions. In addition, we achieve storage of molecular photons originating from a single dibenzanthanthrene molecule in atomic sodium vapour. Given the large set of molecular emission lines matching to atomic transitions, our results enable the combination of almost ideal single-photon sources with various atomic vapours, such that experiments with giant single photon nonlinearities, mediated, for example, by Rydberg atoms(7,8), become feasible.","[Siyushev, Petr; Stein, Guilherme; Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 3, Stuttgart Res Ctr Photon Engn SCoPE, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Siyushev, Petr; Stein, Guilherme; Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja] Ctr Integrated Quantum Sci & Technol IQST, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Gerhardt, I (reprint author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 3, Stuttgart Res Ctr Photon Engn SCoPE, Pfaffenwaldring 57, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",i.gerhardt@fkf.mpg.de,,,Max Planck Society; BMBF; EU,"We thank W.

Axes of chirality can also exist about bonds with hindered barriers of rotation; molecules containing such axes are known as atropisomers(1). Understanding the dynamics of these systems can be useful, for example, in the design of single-atropisomer drugs(2) or molecular switches and motors(3). For molecules that exhibit a single axis of chirality, rotation about that axis leads to racemization as the system reaches equilibrium. Here we report a two-axis system for which an enantioselective reaction produces four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs): following a catalytic asymmetric transformation, we observe a kinetically controlled product distribution that is perturbed from the system's equilibrium position. As the system undergoes isomerization, one of the diastereomeric pairs drifts spontaneously to a higher enantiomeric ratio. In a compensatory manner, the enantiomeric ratio of the other diastereomeric pair decreases. These observations are made for a class of unsymmetrical amides that exhibits two asymmetric axes-one axis is defined through a benzamide substructure, and the other axis is associated with differentially N,N-disubstituted amides. The stereodynamics of these substrates provides an opportunity to observe a curious interplay of kinetics and thermodynamics intrinsic to a system of stereoisomers that is constrained to a situation of partial equilibrium.","[Barrett, Kimberly T.; Metrano, Anthony J.; Miller, Scott J.] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rablen, Paul R.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Chem & Biochem, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA","Miller, SJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem, POB 208107, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",scott.miller@yale.edu,"Metrano, Anthony/B-1895-2013; Miller, Scott/N-7761-2017","Metrano, Anthony/0000-0002-2599-8917; Miller, Scott/0000-0001-7817-1318",National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH [GM-068649]; National Science Foundation; Yale University Faculty of Arts and Sciences High Performance Computing Center; National Science Foundation [CNS 08-21132],"We are grateful to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH (GM-068649) for support.

Repositioning of the intertropical convergence zone is thought to have been responsible for changes in tropical hydroclimate during North Atlantic cold spells(1-5), but the dearth of high-resolution records outside the monsoon realm in the Indian Ocean precludes a full understanding of this remote relationship and its underlying mechanisms. Here we show that slowdowns of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas stadial affected the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate through changes to the Hadley circulation including a southward shift in the rising branch (the intertropical convergence zone) and an overall weakening over the southern Indian Ocean. Our results are based on new, high-resolution sea surface temperature and seawater oxygen isotope records of well-dated sedimentary archives from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for the past 45,000 years, combined with climate model simulations of Atlantic circulation slowdown under Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 3 boundary conditions. Similar conditions in the east and west of the basin rule out a zonal dipole structure as the dominant forcing of the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate of millennial-scale events. Results from our simulations and proxy data suggest dry conditions in the northern Indian Ocean realm and wet and warm conditions in the southern realm during North Atlantic cold spells.","[Mohtadi, Mahyar; Prange, Matthias; Merkel, Ute; Zhang, Xiao; Steinke, Stephan] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Oppo, Delia W.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [De Pol-Holz, Ricardo] Univ Concepcion, Dept Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile; [Lueckge, Andreas] Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, D-30655 Hannover, Germany","Mohtadi, M (reprint author), Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",mmohtadi@marum.de,"Mohtadi, Mahyar/N-2106-2014; De Pol-Holz, Ricardo/E-3740-2013","Mohtadi, Mahyar/0000-0003-3306-0969; De Pol-Holz, Ricardo/0000-0002-3281-8232","German Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [03G0189A]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [HE3412/15-1, STE1044/4-1]; DFG Research Centre/Cluster of Excellence 'The Ocean in the Earth System'); US NSF; Chilean FONDAP [15110009/ICM Nucleus NC120066]","We are grateful to K.

The seismic low velocities and the high electrical conductivities of the asthenosphere are attributed either to subsolidus, water-related defects in olivine minerals(2-4) or to a few volume per cent of partial melt(5-8), but these two interpretations have two shortcomings. First, the amount of water stored in olivine is not expected to be higher than 50 parts per million owing to partitioning with other mantle phases(9) (including pargasite amphibole at moderate temperatures(10)) and partial melting at high temperatures(9). Second, elevated melt volume fractions are impeded by the temperatures prevailing in the asthenosphere, which are too low, and by the melt mobility, which is high and can lead to gravitational segregation(11,12). Here we determine the electrical conductivity of carbon-dioxide-rich and water-rich melts, typically produced at the onset of mantle melting. Electrical conductivity increases modestly with moderate amounts of water and carbon dioxide, but it increases drastically once the carbon dioxide content exceeds six weight per cent in the melt. Incipient melts, long-expected to prevail in the asthenosphere(10,13-15), can therefore produce high electrical conductivities there. Taking into account variable degrees of depletion of the mantle in water and carbon dioxide, and their effect on the petrology of incipient melting, we calculated conductivity profiles across the asthenosphere for various tectonic plate ages. Several electrical discontinuities are predicted and match geophysical observations in a consistent petrological and geochemical framework. In moderately aged plates (more than five million years old), incipient melts probably trigger both the seismic low velocities and the high electrical conductivities in the upper part of the asthenosphere, whereas in young plates(4), where seamount volcanism occurs(6), a higher degree of melting is expected.","[Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice] Univ Orleans, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice] CNRS, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45060 Orleans, France; [Gardes, Emmanuel] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CNRS, Ctr Rech Ions Mat & Photon,UMR 6252, Commissariat Energie Atom,Ecole Natl Super Ingeni, F-14070 Caen, France; [Hier-Majumder, Saswata] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hier-Majumder, Saswata] Univ Maryland, Ctr Sci Computat & Appl Math Modeling, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hier-Majumder, Saswata] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Gaillard, F (reprint author), Univ Orleans, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France.",fabrice.gaillard@cnrs-orleans.fr,"Hier-Majumder, Saswata/C-3917-2009; Gaillard, Fabrice/H-1308-2012","Hier-Majumder, Saswata/0000-0002-2629-1729; Gaillard, Fabrice/0000-0001-8079-0476; Gaillard, Fabrice/0000-0002-4443-8253",European Research Council (ERC) [279790]; French agency for research (ANR) [2010 BLAN62101]; US NSF [EAR1215800]; University of Orleans,"This work, part of the ElectroLith project, benefited from funding by the European Research Council (ERC project #279790) and the French agency for research (ANR project #2010 BLAN62101).

The severe short-term droughts that occurred recently in Amazonia have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climatic disturbances(4-9). The central African rainforests, the second-largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend(10,11) whose impacts on vegetation dynamics remain mostly unknown because in situ observations are very limited. The Congolese forest, with its drier conditions and higher percentage of semi-evergreen trees(12,13), may be more tolerant to short-term rainfall reduction than are wetter tropical forests(11), but for a long-term drought there may be critical thresholds of water availability below which higher-biomass, closed-canopy forests transition to more open, lower-biomass forests(1,2,14). Here we present observational evidence for a widespread decline in forest greenness over the past decade based on analyses of satellite data (optical, thermal, microwave and gravity) from several independent sensors over the Congo basin. This decline in vegetation greenness, particularly in the northern Congolese forest, is generally consistent with decreases in rainfall, terrestrial water storage, water content in aboveground woody and leaf biomass, and the canopy backscatter anomaly caused by changes in structure and moisture in upper forest layers. It is also consistent with increases in photosynthetically active radiation and land surface temperature. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that this large-scale vegetation browning, or loss of photosynthetic capacity, may be partially attributable to the long-term drying trend. Our results suggest that a continued gradual decline of photosynthetic capacity and moisture content driven by the persistent drying trend could alter the composition and structure of the Congolese forest to favour the spread of drought-tolerant species(1,2,14).","[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Tian, Yuhong] NOAA, IMSG, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res,STAR, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Vermote, Eric F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA; [Song, Conghe] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Taehee] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA","Zhou, LM (reprint author), SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",lzhou@albany.edu,"Myneni, Ranga/F-5129-2012; Young, Kristina/M-3069-2014; Liu, Yi/H-9226-2013; Song, Conghe/E-3087-2016; Liu, Yi/M-7169-2015; Zhou, Liming/A-2688-2012","Song, Conghe/0000-0002-4099-4906; Liu, Yi/0000-0001-9059-8269; Chen, Haishan/0000-0002-2403-3187","NOAA NESDIS [NA11NES4400010]; University at Albany, State University of New York; NASA's Earth Science Division; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230422]","This study was supported by the NOAA NESDIS project (NA11NES4400010) and by the startup funds provided by the University at Albany, State University of New York.

Approximately 70% of global oesophageal cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases (>90%)(2,3). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting in a 10% five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes, of which six are well known tumour-associated genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, NFE2L2), and two have not previously been described in ESCC (ADAM29 and FAM135B). Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene, and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes (MLL2 (also called KMT2D), ASH1L, MLL3 (KMT2C), SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300) are frequently altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms, and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic strategies for ESCC.","[Song, Yongmei; Ou, Yunwei; Zhang, Weimin; Ma, Xiaojuan; Liu, Lingyan; Zhao, Zitong; Fan, Jing; Dong, Lijia; Ma, Liying; Ma, Ling; Fu, Ming; Tong, Tong; Wang, Mingrong; Liu, Zhihua; Lin, Dongxin; Zhan, Qimin] Chinese Acad Med Sci, State Key Lab Mol Oncol, Canc Inst & Canc Hosp, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Song, Yongmei; Ou, Yunwei; Zhang, Weimin; Ma, Xiaojuan; Liu, Lingyan; Zhao, Zitong; Fan, Jing; Dong, Lijia; Ma, Liying; Ma, Ling; Fu, Ming; Tong, Tong; Wang, Mingrong; Liu, Zhihua; Lin, Dongxin; Zhan, Qimin] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin; Gao, Zhibo; Li, Xiangchun; Wang, Jiaqian; Zhou, Yong; Huang, Xuanlin; Chen, Gang; Yang, Jie; Chen, Longyun; He, Minghui; Li, Miao; Zhuang, Xuehan; Huang, Kai; Qiu, Kunlong; Yin, Guangliang; Guo, Guangwu; Feng, Qiang; Chen, Peishan; Zhao, Jinyang; Luo, Longhai; Li, Yingrui; Zhang, Xiuqing; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ou, Yunwei; Xu, Bainan] Chinese Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Beijing 100853, Peoples R China; [Li, Enmin; Wu, Jianyi] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Key Lab Mol Biol High Canc Incidence Coastal Chao, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liyan; Chen, Bo] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Inst Oncol Pathol, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhiyong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Shantou Hosp, Shantou Cent Hosp, Dept Tumor Surg, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Zhan, QM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, State Key Lab Mol Oncol, Canc Inst & Canc Hosp, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China.",zhanqimin@pumc.edu.cn,"Li, Yingrui/K-1064-2015; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016","Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 program) [2012AA02A209, 2012AA02A503]; National Natural Science Foundation Fund [81021061]; Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program [2009010016]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U0932001]; National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 program) [2011CB911004, 2009CB521801, 2012CB526608]","This work is supported by the funding from the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 program no. 2012AA02A209 and 2012AA02A503), National Natural Science Foundation Fund (81021061), Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program (2009010016), the National Natural Science Foundation of China-GuangDong Joint Fund (U0932001), and the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 program no. 2011CB911004, 2009CB521801 and 2012CB526608).

Huntington's disease is characterized by highly selective and profound damage to the corpus striatum, which regulates motor function. Striatal selectivity of Huntington's disease may reflect the striatally selective small G protein Rhes binding to mHtt and enhancing its neurotoxicity(2). Specific molecular mechanisms by which mHtt elicits neurodegeneration have been hard to determine. Here we show a major depletion of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, in Huntington's disease tissues, which may mediate Huntington's disease pathophysiology. The defect occurs at the transcriptional level and seems to reflect influences of mHtt on specificity protein 1, a transcriptional activator for CSE. Consistent with the notion of loss of CSE as a pathogenic mechanism, supplementation with cysteine reverses abnormalities in cultures of Huntington's disease tissues and in intact mouse models of Huntington's disease, suggesting therapeutic potential.","[Paul, Bindu D.; Sbodio, Juan I.; Xu, Risheng; Vandiver, M.

However, these poorly defined maternal factors presumably decline sharply after fertilization, as the cytoplasm of pronuclear-stage zygotes is reportedly inactive(4,5). Recent evidence suggests that zygotic cytoplasm, if maintained at metaphase, can also support derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells after SCNT6-8, albeit at low efficiency. This led to the conclusion that critical oocyte reprogramming factors present in the metaphase but not in the interphase cytoplasm are 'trapped' inside the nucleus during interphase and effectively removed during enucleation(9). Here we investigated the presence of reprogramming activity in the cytoplasm of interphase two-cell mouse embryos (I2C). First, the presence of candidate reprogramming factors was documented in both intact and enucleated metaphase and interphase zygotes and two-cell embryos. Consequently, enucleation did not provide a likely explanation for the inability of interphase cytoplasm to induce reprogramming. Second, when we carefully synchronized the cell cycle stage between the transplanted nucleus (ES cell, fetal fibroblast or terminally differentiated cumulus cell) and the recipient I2C cytoplasm, the reconstructed SCNT embryos developed into blastocysts and ES cells capable of contributing to traditional germline and tetraploid chimaeras. Last, direct transfer of cloned embryos, reconstructed with ES cell nuclei, into recipients resulted in live offspring. Thus, the cytoplasm of I2C supports efficient reprogramming, with cell cycle synchronization between the donor nucleus and recipient cytoplasm as the most critical parameter determining success. The ability to use interphase cytoplasm in SCNT could aid efforts to generate autologous human ES cells for regenerative applications, as donated or discarded embryos are more accessible than unfertilized MII oocytes.","[Kang, Eunju; Ma, Hong; Li, Ying; Tippner-Hedges, Rebecca; Tachibana, Masahito; Sparman, Michelle; Wolf, Don P.; Mitalipov, Shoukhrat] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Reprod & Dev Sci, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Wu, Guangming; Schoeler, Hans R.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Mitalipov, S (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Reprod & Dev Sci, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.",mitalipo@ohsu.edu,,"Scholer, Hans/0000-0003-2643-5136","National Institutes of Health [R01HD063276, R01HD057121, R01HD059946, R01EY021214, P51OD011092]; Leducq Fondation; Collins Medical Trust","The authors would like to acknowledge the Small Lab Animal Unit at Oregon National Primate Research Center for providing expertise and services that contributed to this project.

Much of our understanding of this process has emerged from analysis of bulk cytoplasmic autophagy, but our understanding of how specific cargo, including organelles, proteins or intracellular pathogens, are targeted for selective autophagy is limited(3). Here we use quantitative proteomics to identify a cohort of novel and known autophagosome-enriched proteins in human cells, including cargo receptors. Like known cargo receptors, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) was highly enriched in autophagosomes, and associated with ATG8 proteins that recruit cargo-receptor complexes into autophagosomes. Unbiased identification of NCOA4-associated proteins revealed ferritin heavy and light chains, components of an iron-filled cage structure that protects cells from reactive iron species(4) but is degraded via autophagy to release iron(5,6) through an unknown mechanism. We found that delivery of ferritin to lysosomes required NCOA4, and an inability of NCOA4-deficient cells to degrade ferritin led to decreased bioavailable intracellular iron. This work identifies NCOA4 as a selective cargo receptor for autophagic turnover of ferritin (ferritinophagy), which is critical for iron homeostasis, and provides a resource for further dissection of autophagosomal cargo-receptor connectivity.","[Mancias, Joseph D.; Wang, Xiaoxu; Kimmelman, Alec C.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Genom Stabil & DNA Repair, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mancias, Joseph D.; Gygi, Steven P.; Harper, J.

In the conventional view, ubiquitin alters the signalling activity of the target protein through covalent modification, but accumulating evidence points to the emerging role of noncovalent interaction between ubiquitin and the target. In the innate immune signalling pathway of a viral RNA sensor, RIG-I, both covalent and non-covalent interactions with K63-linked ubiquitin chains (K63-Ub(n)) were shown to occur in its signalling domain, a tandem caspase activation and recruitment domain (hereafter referred to as 2CARD)(1,2). Non-covalent binding of K63-Ub(n) to 2CARD induces its tetramer formation, a requirement for downstream signal activation(3). Here we report the crystal structure of the tetramer of human RIG-I 2CARD bound by three chains of K63-Ub(2). 2CARD assembles into a helical tetramer resembling a 'lock-washer', in which the tetrameric surface serves as a signalling platform for recruitment and activation of the downstream signalling molecule, MAVS. Ubiquitin chains are bound along the outer rim of the helical trajectory, bridging adjacent subunits of 2CARD and stabilizing the 2CARD tetramer. The combination of structural and functional analyses reveals that binding avidity dictates the K63-linkage and chain-length specificity of 2CARD, and that covalent ubiquitin conjugation of 2CARD further stabilizes the Ub-2CARD interaction and thus the 2CARD tetramer. Our work provides unique insights into the novel types of ubiquitin-mediated signal-activation mechanism, and previously unexpected synergism between the covalent and non-covalent ubiquitin interaction modes.","[Peisley, Alys; Wu, Bin; Hur, Sun] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Peisley, Alys; Wu, Bin; Hur, Sun] Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xu, Hui; Chen, Zhijian J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chen, Zhijian J.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Hur, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Sun.Hur@childrens.harvard.edu,"Wu, Bin/C-4715-2015",,GSK; Welch Foundation [I-1389]; NIH [R01-GM63692]; Pew Scholarship; BCH,"We thank G.

There are a total of eight distinct functional P2YRs expressed in human, which are subdivided into P2Y1-like receptors and P2Y(12)-like receptors(1). Their ligands are generally charged molecules with relatively low bioavailability and stability in vivo(2), which limits our understanding of this receptor family. P2Y(12)R regulates platelet activation and thrombus formation(3,4), and several antithrombotic drugs targeting P2Y(12)R-including the prodrugs clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Effient) that are metabolized and bind covalently, and the nucleoside analogue ticagrelor (Brilinta) that acts directly on the receptor-have been approved for the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction. However, limitations of these drugs (for example, a very long half-life of clopidogrel action and a characteristic adverse effect profile of ticagrelor) 5,6 suggest that there is an unfulfilled medical need for developing a new generation of P2Y(12)R inhibitors(7,8). Here we report the 2.6 angstrom resolution crystal structure of human P2Y(12)R in complex with a non-nucleotide reversible antagonist, AZD1283. The structure reveals a distinct straight conformation of helix V, which sets P2Y(12)R apart from all other known class A GPCR structures. With AZD1283 bound, the highly conserved disulphide bridge in GPCRs between helix III and extracellular loop 2 is not observed and appears to be dynamic. Along with the details of the AZD1283-binding site, analysis of the extracellular interface reveals an adjacent ligand-binding region and suggests that both pockets could be required for dinucleotide binding. The structure provides essential insights for the development of improved P2Y(12)R ligands and allosteric modulators as drug candidates.","[Zhang, Kaihua; Zhang, Jin; Zhang, Dandan; Zhu, Lan; Lu, Weizhen; Zhang, Wenru; Wu, Beili; Zhao, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zhan-Guo; Moss, Steven M.; Paoletta, Silvia; Kiselev, Evgeny; Jacobson, Kenneth A.] NIDDK, Mol Recognit Sect, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Han, Gye Won; Fenalti, Gustavo; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mueller, Christa E.] PharmaCtr Bonn, Inst Pharmaceut, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Huaiyu; Jiang, Hualiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Stevens, Raymond C.] ShanghaiTech Univ, iHuman Inst, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Zhao, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",zhaoq@simm.ac.cn,"Jacobson, Kenneth/A-1530-2009; Cherezov, Vadim/L-9812-2013; Katritch, Vsevolod/Q-8357-2016; Muller, Christa/C-7748-2014","Jacobson, Kenneth/0000-0001-8104-1493; Cherezov, Vadim/0000-0002-5265-3914; Muller, Christa/0000-0002-0013-6624; Stevens, Raymond/0000-0002-4522-8725; Zhang, Kaihua/0000-0003-3734-3624; Katritch, Vsevolod/0000-0003-3883-4505","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB910400, 2012CB518000]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 AI100604, U54 GM094618]; National Science Foundation of China [31370729, 31170683]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Associate program; NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Intramural Research Program","This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China grants 2012CB910400 and 2012CB518000 (B.

Although mutagenesis and modelling studies of the P2Y(12)R provided useful insights into ligand binding(1-4), the agonist and antagonist recognition and function at the P2Y(12)R remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report the structures of the human P2Y(12)R in complex with the full agonist 2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-diphosphate (2MeSADP, a close analogue of endogenous agonist ADP) at 2.5 angstrom resolution, and the corresponding ATP derivative 2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (2MeSATP) at 3.1 angstrom resolution. These structures, together with the structure of the P2Y(12)R with antagonist ethyl 6-(4-((benzylsulfonyl) carbamoyl)piperidin-1-yl)-5-cyano-2-methylnicotinate (AZD1283)(5), reveal striking conformational changes between nucleotide and non-nucleotide ligand complexes in the extracellular regions. Further analysis of these changes provides insight into a distinct ligand binding landscape inthed-group of class AG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Agonist and non-nucleotide antagonist adopt different orientations in the P2Y(12)R, with only partially overlapped binding pockets. The agonist-bound P2Y(12)R structure answers long-standing questions surrounding P2Y(12)R-agonist recognition, and reveals interactions with several residues that had not been reported to be involved in agonist binding. As a first example, to our knowledge, of a GPCR in which agonist access to the binding pocket requires large-scale rearrangements in the highly malleable extracellular region, the structural and docking studies will therefore provide invaluable insight into the pharmacology and mechanisms of action of agonists and different classes of antagonists for the P2Y(12)R and potentially for other closely related P2YRs.","[Zhang, Jin; Zhang, Kaihua; Zhang, Dandan; Li, Tingting; Ma, Limin; Zhang, Wenru; Wu, Beili; Zhao, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zhan-Guo; Paoletta, Silvia; Jacobson, Kenneth A.] Natl Inst Diabet & Digest & Kidney Dis, Mol Recognit Sect, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Han, Gye Won; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mueller, Christa E.] Univ Bonn, PharmaCtr Bonn, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Huaiyu; Jiang, Hualiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Stevens, Raymond C.] ShanghaiTech Univ, IHuman Inst, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Wu, BL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",beiliwu@simm.ac.cn; zhaoq@simm.ac.cn,"Jacobson, Kenneth/A-1530-2009; Cherezov, Vadim/L-9812-2013; Katritch, Vsevolod/Q-8357-2016; Muller, Christa/C-7748-2014","Jacobson, Kenneth/0000-0001-8104-1493; Cherezov, Vadim/0000-0002-5265-3914; Muller, Christa/0000-0002-0013-6624; Stevens, Raymond/0000-0002-4522-8725; Zhang, Kaihua/0000-0003-3734-3624; Katritch, Vsevolod/0000-0003-3883-4505","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB910400, 2012CB518000, 2014CB910400]; National Institutes of Health [R01AI100604, U54 GM094618]; National Science Foundation of China [31370729]; National Science and Technology Major Project [2013ZX09507001, 2012ZX09301001]; National Institutes of Health NIDDK Intramural Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91313000]","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China grants 2012CB910400, 2012CB518000 and 2014CB910400 (B.

Although nectar function and composition have been characterized, the mechanism of nectar secretion has remained unclear(2). Here we identify SWEET9 as a nectary-specific sugar transporter in three eudicot species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa (extrastaminal nectaries) and Nicotiana attenuata (gynoecial nectaries). We show that SWEET9 is essential for nectar production and can function as an efflux transporter. We also show that sucrose phosphate synthase genes, encoding key enzymes for sucrose biosynthesis, are highly expressed in nectaries and that their expression is also essential for nectar secretion. Together these data are consistent with a model in which sucrose is synthesized in the nectary parenchyma and subsequently secreted into the extracellular space via SWEET9, where sucrose is hydrolysed by an apoplasmic invertase to produce a mixture of sucrose, glucose and fructose. The recruitment of SWEET9 for sucrose export may have been a key innovation, and could have coincided with the evolution of core eudicots and contributed to the evolution of nectar secretion to reward pollinators.","[Lin, I.

Sea level has been documented using several independent methods over the past 0.5 million years (Myr). Older periods, however, lack such independent validation; all existing records are related to deep-sea oxygen isotope (delta O-18) data that are influenced by processes unrelated to sea level. For deep-sea temperature, only one continuous high-resolution (Mg/Ca-based) record exists, with related sea-level estimates, spanning the past 1.5 Myr. Here we present a novel sea-level reconstruction, with associated estimates of deep-sea temperature, which independently validates the previous 0-1.5 Myr reconstruction and extends it back to 5.3 Myr ago. We find that deep-sea temperature and sea level generally decreased through time, but distinctly out of synchrony, which is remarkable given the importance of ice-albedo feedbacks on the radiative forcing of climate. In particular, we observe a large temporal offset during the onset of Plio-Pleistocene ice ages, between a marked cooling step at 2.73 Myr ago and the first major glaciation at 2.15 Myr ago. Last, we tentatively infer that ice sheets may have grown largest during glacials with more modest reductions in deep-sea temperature.","[Rohling, E. J.; Grant, K. M.; Marino, G.; Roberts, A.

Here we identify folate receptor 4 (Folr4) as the receptor for Izumo1 on the mouse egg, and propose to rename it Juno. We show that the Izumo1-Juno interaction is conserved within several mammalian species, including humans. Female mice lacking Juno are infertile and Juno-deficient eggs do not fuse with normal sperm. Rapid shedding of Juno from the oolemma after fertilization suggests a mechanism for the membrane block to polyspermy, ensuring eggs normally fuse with just a single sperm. Our discovery of an essential receptor pair at the nexus of conception provides opportunities for the rational development of new fertility treatments and contraceptives.","[Bianchi, Enrica; Wright, Gavin J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cell Surface Signalling Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Doe, Brendan] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Mouse Prod Team, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Goulding, David] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England","Wright, GJ (reprint author), Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cell Surface Signalling Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England.",gw2@sanger.ac.uk,,"Bianchi, Enrica/0000-0001-8124-7328",Wellcome Trust [098051],This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust grant number 098051.

Here we trace Y evolution across 15 representative mammals on the basis of high-throughput genome and transcriptome sequencing. We uncover three independent sex chromosome originations in mammals and birds (the outgroup). The original placental and marsupial (therian) Y, containing the sex-determining gene SRY, emerged in the therian ancestor approximately 180 million years ago, in parallel with the first of five monotreme Y chromosomes, carrying the probable sex-determining gene AMH. The avian W chromosome arose approximately 140 million years ago in the bird ancestor. The small Y/W gene repertoires, enriched in regulatory functions, were rapidly defined following stratification (recombination arrest) and erosion events and have remained considerably stable. Despite expression decreases in therians, Y/W genes show notable conservation of proto-sex chromosome expression patterns, although various Y genes evolved testis-specificities through differential regulatory decay. Thus, although some genes evolved novel functions through spatial/temporal expression shifts, most Y genes probably endured, at least initially, because of dosage constraints.","[Cortez, Diego; Marin, Ray; Froidevaux, Laure; Liechti, Angelica; Kaessmann, Henrik] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cortez, Diego; Marin, Ray; Kaessmann, Henrik] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Toledo-Flores, Deborah; Gruetzner, Frank] Univ Adelaide, Robinson Res Inst, Sch Mol & Biomed Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Waters, Paul D.] UNSWAustralia, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Cortez, D (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",diegoclaudio.cortezquezada@unil.ch; henrik.kaessmann@unil.ch,"Kaessmann, Henrik/B-4989-2013; Waters, Paul/B-7871-2015","Grutzner, Frank/0000-0002-3088-7314",Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT); ARC; European Research Council [242597]; Swiss National Science Foundation [130287],"We thank K.

We reconstructed the evolution of the Y chromosome across eight mammals to identify biases in gene content and the selective pressures that preserved the surviving ancestral genes. Our findings indicate that survival was nonrandom, and in two cases, convergent across placental and marsupial mammals. We conclude that the gene content of the Y chromosome became specialized through selection to maintain the ancestral dosage of homologous X-Y gene pairs that function as broadly expressed regulators of transcription, translation and protein stability.

Quantum error correction(6) provides this protection by distributing a logical state among many physical quantum bits (qubits) by means of quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is a useful phenomenon in this regard, because it allows the construction of large quantum circuits and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits, the surface code approach to quantum computing(7) is a natural choice for error correction, because it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: the per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99 per cent. Here we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92 per cent and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.4 per cent. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerance threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state(8,9) using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits.","[Barends, R.; Kelly, J.; Megrant, A.; Sank, D.; Jeffrey, E.; White, T.

However, efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 and its derivatives into a desirable fuel(1-3) are not available at present. Although many catalysts(4-11) can reduce CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO), liquid fuel synthesis requires that CO is reduced further, using H2O as a H+ source. Copper (Cu) is the only known material with an appreciable CO electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use. In particular, H2O reduction to H-2 outcompetes CO reduction on Cu electrodes unless extreme overpotentials are applied, at which point gaseous hydrocarbons are the major CO reduction products(12,13). Here we show that nanocrystalline Cu prepared from Cu2O ('oxide-derivedCu') produces multi-carbon oxygenates (ethanol, acetate and n-propanol) with up to 57% Faraday efficiency at modest potentials (-0.25 volts to -0.5 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO-saturated alkaline H2O. By comparison, when prepared by traditional vapour condensation, Cu nanoparticles with an average crystallite size similar to that of oxide-derived copper produce nearly exclusive H-2 (96% Faraday efficiency) under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability to change the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu for this notoriously difficult reaction by growing interconnected nanocrystallites from the constrained environment of an oxide lattice. The selectivity for oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product, demonstrates the feasibility of a two-step conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel that could be powered by renewable electricity.","[Li, Christina W.; Kanan, Matthew W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ciston, Jim] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Kanan, MW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mkanan@stanford.edu,"Foundry, Molecular/G-9968-2014",,"Stanford University; NSF [CHE-1266401]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank Stanford University and the NSF (CHE-1266401) for support of this work.

It also influences ocean and crustal chemistry, provides a basis for chemosynthetic ecosystems, and has formed massive sulphide ore deposits throughout Earth's history. Despite this, how and under what conditions heat is extracted, in particular from the lower crust, remains largely unclear. Here we present high-resolution, whole-crust, two-and three-dimensional simulations of hydrothermal flow beneath fast-spreading ridges that predict the existence of two interacting flow components, controlled by different physical mechanisms, that merge above the melt lens to feed ridge-centred vent sites. Shallow on-axis flow structures develop owing to the thermodynamic properties of water, whereas deeper off-axis flow is strongly shaped by crustal permeability, particularly the brittleductile transition. About 60 per cent of the discharging fluid mass is replenished on-axis by warm (up to 300 degrees Celsius) recharge flow surrounding the hot thermal plumes, and the remaining 40 per cent or so occurs as colder and broader recharge up to several kilometres away from the axis that feeds hot (500-700 degrees Celsius) deep-rooted off-axis flow towards the ridge. Despite its lower contribution to the total mass flux, this deep off-axis flow carries about 70 per cent of the thermal energy released at the ridge axis. This combination of two flow components explains the seismically determined thermal structure of the crust and reconciles previously incompatible models favouring either shallower on-axis(3-5) or deeper off-axis hydrothermal circulation(6-8).","[Hasenclever, Joerg; Ruepke, Lars H.; Iyer, Karthik; Petersen, Sven; Devey, Colin W.] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, GEOMAR, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Theissen-Krah, Sonja] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Theissen-Krah, Sonja] Univ Oslo, CEED, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Morgan, Jason P.] Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Hasenclever, J (reprint author), Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, GEOMAR, Wischhofstr 1-3, D-24148 Kiel, Germany.",jhasenclever@geomar.de,"Ruepke, Lars/B-8597-2015; Devey, Colin/I-3898-2016; Iyer, Karthik/N-4763-2016; Petersen, Sven/N-9528-2016","Ruepke, Lars/0000-0001-7025-4362; Devey, Colin/0000-0002-0930-7274; Iyer, Karthik/0000-0003-4689-5543; Petersen, Sven/0000-0002-5469-105X; Theissen-Krah, Sonja/0000-0002-6163-5515",,,,46,15,15,1,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Apr,2014,508,7497,,,,,508,+,,10.1038/nature13174,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AF5GI,WOS:000334741600033,24759413,No,,,11/20/17

The time lag between the first proto-subduction (about 4 billion years ago) and global tectonics (approximately 3 billion years ago) suggests that plates and plate boundaries became widespread over a period of 1 billion years. The reason for this time lag is unknown but fundamental to understanding the origin of plate tectonics. Here we suggest that when sufficient lithospheric damage (which promotes shear localization and long-lived weak zones) combines with transient mantle flow and migrating proto-subduction, it leads to the accumulation of weak plate boundaries and eventually to fully formed tectonic plates driven by subduction alone. We simulate this process using a grain evolution and damage mechanism with a composite rheology (which is compatible with field and laboratory observations of polycrystalline rocks(1,2)), coupled to an idealized model of pressure-driven lithospheric flow in which a low-pressure zone is equivalent to the suction of convective downwellings. In the simplest case, for Earth-like conditions, a few successive rotations of the driving pressure field yield relic damaged weak zones that are inherited by the lithospheric flow to forma nearly perfect plate, with passive spreading and strike-slip margins that persist and localize further, even though flow is driven only by subduction. But for hotter surface conditions, such as those on Venus, accumulation and inheritance of damage is negligible; hence only subduction zones survive and plate tectonics does not spread, which corresponds to observations. After plates have developed, continued changes in driving forces, combined with inherited damage and weak zones, promote increased tectonic complexity, such as oblique subduction, strike-slip boundaries that are subparallel to plate motion, and spalling of minor plates.","[Bercovici, David] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ricard, Yanick] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ENS Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Bercovici, D (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",david.bercovici@yale.edu,"ricard, yanick/C-6287-2009","ricard, yanick/0000-0002-0998-4670",National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche,"D.

Ecological theory predicts these changes should be strongly counteractive: nutrient addition drives plant species loss through intensified competition for light, whereas herbivores prevent competitive exclusion by increasing ground-level light, particularly in productive systems(8,9). Here we use experimental data spanning a globally relevant range of conditions to test the hypothesis that herbaceous plant species losses caused by eutrophication may be offset by increased light availability due to herbivory. This experiment, replicated in 40 grasslands on 6 continents, demonstrates that nutrients and herbivores can serve as counteracting forces to control local plant diversity through light limitation, independent of site productivity, soil nitrogen, herbivore type and climate. Nutrient addition consistently reduced local diversity through light limitation, and herbivory rescued diversity at sites where it alleviated light limitation. Thus, species loss from anthropogenic eutrophication can be ameliorated in grasslands where herbivory increases ground-level light.","[Borer, Elizabeth T.; Seabloom, Eric W.; Lind, Eric M.; Hautier, Yann; Wragg, Peter D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Harpole, W.

However, it remains unknown whether these findings are relevant to natural ecosystems, especially those for which species diversity is threatened by anthropogenic global change(8-11). Here we analyse diversity-stability relationships from 41 grasslands on five continents and examine how these relationships are affected by chronic fertilization, one of the strongest drivers of species loss globally(8). Unmanipulated communities with more species had greater species asynchrony, resulting in more stable biomass production, generalizing a result from biodiversity experiments to real-world grasslands. However, fertilization weakened the positive effect of diversity on stability. Contrary to expectations, this was not due to species loss after eutrophication but rather to an increase in the temporal variation of productivity in combination with a decrease in species asynchrony in diverse communities. Our results demonstrate separate and synergistic effects of diversity and eutrophication on stability, emphasizing the need to understand how drivers of global change interactively affect the reliable provisioning of ecosystem services in real-world systems.","[Hautier, Yann; Seabloom, Eric W.; Borer, Elizabeth T.; Lind, Eric M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Harpole, W.

The parasite was named ""histolytica'' for its ability to destroy host tissues, which is probably driven by direct killing of human cells. The mechanism of human cell killing has been unclear, although the accepted model was that the parasites use secreted toxic effectors to kill cells before ingestion(1). Here we report the discovery that amoebae kill by ingesting distinct pieces of living human cells, resulting in intracellular calcium elevation and eventual cell death. After cell killing, amoebae detach and cease ingestion. Ingestion of human cell fragments is required for cell killing, and also contributes to invasion of intestinal tissue. The internalization of fragments of living human cells is reminiscent of trogocytosis (from Greek trogo, nibble) observed between immune cells(2-6), but amoebic trogocytosis differs because it results in death. The ingestion of live cell material and the rejection of corpses illuminate a stark contrast to the established model of dead cell clearance in multicellular organisms(7). These findings change the model for tissue destruction in amoebiasis and suggest an ancient origin of trogocytosis as a form of intercellular exchange.","[Ralston, Katherine S.; Mackey-Lawrence, Nicole M.; Petri, William A., Jr.] Univ Virginia, Dept Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Solga, Michael D.; Petri, William A., Jr.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Canc Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Somlata; Bhattacharya, Alok] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Life Sci, New Delhi 110067, India; [Petri, William A., Jr.] Univ Virginia, Dept Pathol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Petri, WA (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",wap3g@virginia.edu,,"Ralston, Katherine/0000-0002-1604-7634","Howard Hughes Medical Institute from the Life Sciences Research Foundation; Hartwell Foundation; NIH [AI07046-32, 5R01 AI-26649]","We thank J.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated in heart failure(4,5) but whether they control contractility or constitute therapeutic targets remains speculative. Using high-throughput functional screening of the human microRNAome, here we identify miRNAs that suppress intracellular calcium handling in heart muscle by interacting with messenger RNA encoding the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake pump SERCA2a (also known as ATP2A2). Of 875 miRNAs tested, miR-25 potently delayed calcium uptake kinetics in cardiomyocytes in vitro and was upregulated in heart failure, both in mice and humans. Whereas adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of miR-25 in vivo resulted in a significant loss of contractile function, injection of an antisense oligonucleotide (antagomiR) against miR-25 markedly halted established heart failure in a mouse model, improving cardiac function and survival relative to a control antagomiR oligonucleotide. These data reveal that increased expression of endogenous miR-25 contributes to declining cardiac function during heart failure and suggest that it might be targeted therapeutically to restore function.","[Wahlquist, Christine; Rojas-Munoz, Agustin; van Mil, Alain; Mercola, Mark] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wahlquist, Christine; Rojas-Munoz, Agustin; van Mil, Alain; Mercola, Mark] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Muscle Dev & Regenerat Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jeong, Dongtak; Kho, Changwon; Lee, Ahyoung; Mitsuyama, Shinichi; Hajjar, Roger J.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, New York, NY 10029 USA; [van Mil, Alain; Sluijter, Joost P.

Here we find that the transcription factor Foxc1 is preferentially expressed in the adipo-osteogenic progenitor CAR cells essential for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell maintenance in vivo(5,13,18) in the developing and adult bone marrow. When Foxc1 was deleted in all marrow mesenchymal cells or CAR cells, from embryogenesis onwards, osteoblasts appeared normal, but haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were markedly reduced and marrow cavities were occupied by adipocytes (yellow adipose marrow) with reduced CAR cells. Inducible deletion of Foxc1 in adult mice depleted haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reduced CXCL12 and stem cell factor expression in CAR cells but did not induce a change to yellow marrow. These data suggest a role for Foxc1 in inhibiting adipogenic processes in CAR progenitors. Foxc1 might also promote CAR cell development, upregulating CXCL12 and stem cell factor expression. This study identifies Foxc1 as a specific transcriptional regulator essential for development and maintenance of the mesenchymal niches for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.","[Omatsu, Yoshiki; Seike, Masanari; Sugiyama, Tatsuki; Nagasawa, Takashi] Kyoto Univ, Dept Immunobiol & Hematol, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Omatsu, Yoshiki; Seike, Masanari; Sugiyama, Tatsuki; Nagasawa, Takashi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Kume, Tsutomu] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Cardiovasc Res Inst, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Nagasawa, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Immunobiol & Hematol, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",tnagasa@frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Sugiyama, Tatsuki/0000-0002-9349-0824","JST, CREST; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","We appreciate the technical assistance provided by K.

Akt hyperactivation contributes to many pathophysiological conditions, including human cancers(1-3), and is closely associated with poor prognosis and chemo-or radio-therapeutic resistance(4). Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. However, it remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt activation, and whether Akt hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle progression, another cancer hallmark(7). Here we report that Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct physiological conditions, promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or functionally compensating for, S473 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deletion of the cyclin A2 allele in the mouse olfactory bulb leads to reduced S477/T479 phosphorylation and elevated cellular apoptosis. Notably, cyclin A2-deletion-induced cellular apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells is partly rescued by S477D/T479E-Akt1, supporting a physiological role for cyclin A2 in governing Akt activation. Together, the results of our study show Akt S477/T479 phosphorylation to be an essential layer of the Akt activation mechanism to regulate its physiological functions, thereby providing a new mechanistic link between aberrant cell cycle progression and Akt hyperactivation in cancer.","[Liu, Pengda; Inuzuka, Hiroyuki; Gao, Daming; Gan, Wenjian; Papa, Antonella; Wan, Lixin; Wang, Zhiwei; Toker, Alex; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo; Wei, Wenyi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Begley, Michael; Tsou, Peiling; Papa, Antonella; Yuan, Min; Lu, Kun-Ping; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo; Asara, John M.; Cantley, Lewis] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Begley, Michael; Tsou, Peiling; Kirschner, Marc W.; Cantley, Lewis] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Michowski, Wojciech; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Michowski, Wojciech; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ginzberg, Miriam; Zhai, Bo; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Papa, Antonella; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Papa, Antonella; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Genet, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Singh, Amrik] Cell Signaling Technol, Danvers, MA 01923 USA; [Kim, Byeong Mo; Lee, Tae Ho] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Gerontol, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Wei, WY (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",wwei2@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Cantley, Lewis/D-1800-2014","Cantley, Lewis/0000-0002-1298-7653; Papa, Antonella/0000-0001-8653-7121","National Institutes of Health [GM089763, GM094777, CA177910, 2P01CA120964, R01CA132740];  [5T32HL007893]","We thank J.

The construction of such compounds in an enantioselective fashion remains a long-standing challenge to synthetic organic chemists. In particular, methods for synthesizing quaternary stereocentres that are remote from other functional groups are underdeveloped. Here we report a catalytic and enantioselective intermolecular Heck-type reaction of trisubstituted-alkenyl alcohols with aryl boronic acids. This method provides direct access to quaternary all-carbon-substituted beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-or zeta-aryl carbonyl compounds, because the unsaturation of the alkene is relayed to the alcohol, resulting in the formation of a carbonyl group. The scope of the process also includes incorporation of pre-existing stereocentres along the alkyl chain, which links the alkene and the alcohol, in which the stereocentre is preserved.

To assess the perturbations of gene expression in trisomy 21, and to eliminate the noise of genomic variability, we studied the transcriptome of fetal fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21. Here we show that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along all chromosomes that are either upregulated or downregulated. These gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs)can be defined by the expression level of their gene content, and are well conserved in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the twins' fibroblasts. Comparison of the transcriptome of the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down's syndrome and normal littermate mouse fibroblasts also showed GEDDs along the mouse chromosomes that were syntenic in human. The GEDDs correlate with the lamina- associated (LADs)and replication domains of mammalian cells. The overall position of LADs was not altered in trisomic cells; however, the H3K4me3 profile of the trisomic fibroblasts was modified and accurately followed the GEDD pattern. These results indicate that the nuclear compartments of trisomic cells undergo modifications of the chromatin environment influencing the overall transcriptome, and that GEDDs may therefore contribute to some trisomy 21 phenotypes.","[Letourneau, Audrey; Santoni, Federico A.; Bonilla, Ximena; Sailani, M.

One class of spinal interneurons implicated in the control of mammalian forelimb movement, cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs), has the potential to convey an internal copy of premotor signals through dual innervation of forelimb-innervating motor neurons and precerebellar neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus. Here we examine whether the PNinternal copy pathway functions in the control of goal-directed reaching. In mice, PNs include a genetically accessible subpopulation of cervical V2a interneurons, and their targeted ablation perturbs reaching while leaving intact other elements of forelimb movement. Moreover, optogenetic activation of the PN internal copy branch recruits a rapid cerebellar feedback loop that modulates forelimb motor neuron activity and severely disrupts reaching kinematics. Our findings implicate V2a PNs as the focus of an internal copy pathway assigned to the rapid updating of motor output during reaching behaviour.","[Azim, Eiman; Jessell, Thomas M.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, Mortimer B Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst,Dept N, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Azim, Eiman; Jessell, Thomas M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jiang, Juan; Alstermark, Bror] Umea Univ, Physiol Sect, Dept Integrat Med Biol, Umea, Sweden","Jessell, TM (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, Mortimer B Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst,Dept N, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ea2471@columbia.edu; bror.alstermark@umu.se; tmj1@columbia.edu,,"Azim, Eiman/0000-0002-1015-1772",Umea University; Swedish Research Council; National Institutes of Health [NS033245]; Harold and Leila Y.

The degree to which Martian magmas may have assimilated crustal material, thus altering the geochemical signatures acquired from their mantle sources, is unclear(1). This issue features prominently in efforts to understand whether the source of light rare-earth elements in enriched shergottites lies in crustal material incorporated into melts(1,2) or in mixing between enriched and depleted mantle reservoirs(3). Sulphur isotope systematics offer insight into some aspects of crustal assimilation. The presence of igneous sulphides in Martian meteorites with sulphur isotope signatures indicative of mass-independent fractionation suggests the assimilation of sulphur both during passage of magmas through the crust of Mars and at sites of emplacement. Here we report isotopic analyses of 40 Martian meteorites that represent more than half of the distinct known Martian meteorites, including 30 shergottites (28 plus 2 pairs, where pairs are separate fragments of a single meteorite), 8 nakhlites (5 plus 3 pairs), Allan Hills 84001 and Chassigny. Our data provide strong evidence that assimilation of sulphur into Martian magmas was a common occurrence throughout much of the planet's history. The signature of mass-independent fractionation observed also indicates that the atmospheric imprint of photochemical processing preserved in Martian meteoritic sulphide and sulphate is distinct from that observed in terrestrial analogues, suggesting fundamental differences between the dominant sulphur chemistry in the atmosphere of Mars and that in the atmosphere of Earth(4).","[Franz, Heather B.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Ctr Res & Explorat Space Sci & Technol, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Franz, Heather B.; Farquhar, James; Hoek, Joost; Dottin, James, III] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Franz, Heather B.; Farquhar, James; Hoek, Joost; Dottin, James, III] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kim, Sang-Tae] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Day, James M.

Nevertheless, although transport in superconducting wires is perfectly lossless for direct current, transport of radio-frequency signals can be dissipative in the presence of quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap(1). Moreover, the exact mechanism of this dissipation in Josephson junctions has never been fully resolved experimentally. In particular, Josephson's key theoretical prediction that quasiparticle dissipation should vanish in transport through a junction when the phase difference across the junction is pi ( ref. 2) has never been observed(3). This subtle effect can be understood as resulting from the destructive interference of two separate dissipative channels involving electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles. Here we report the experimental observation of this quantum coherent suppression of quasiparticle dissipation across a Josephson junction. As the average phase bias across the junction is swept through p, we measure an increase of more than one order of magnitude in the energy relaxation time of a superconducting artificial atom. This striking suppression of dissipation, despite the presence of lossy quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap, provides a powerful tool for minimizing decoherence in quantum electronic systems and could be directly exploited in quantum information experiments with superconducting quantum bits.","[Pop, Ioan M.; Geerlings, Kurtis; Catelani, Gianluigi; Schoelkopf, Robert J.; Glazman, Leonid I.; Devoret, Michel H.] Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Catelani, Gianluigi] Peter Grunberg Inst PGI 2, Forschungszentrum Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Pop, IM (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, 15 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",ioan.pop@yale.edu,"Catelani, Gianluigi/E-7134-2011","Catelani, Gianluigi/0000-0002-0421-7325; Pop, Ioan/0000-0002-6776-9792","YINQE; NSF MRSEC DMR [1119826]; IARPA [W911NF-09-1-0369]; ARO [W911NF-09-1-0514]; NSF [DMR-1006060, DMR-0653377]; DOE [DE-FG02-08ER46482]; EU under REA [CIG-618258]","We acknowledge discussions with L.

The efficiency of thermoelectric materials is dictated by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT (where Z is the figure of merit and T is absolute temperature), which governs the Carnot efficiency for heat conversion. Enhancements above the generally high threshold value of 2.5 have important implications for commercial deployment(1,2), especially for compounds free of Pb and Te. Here we report an unprecedented ZT of 2.6 +/- 0.3 at 923 K, realized in SnSe single crystals measured along the b axis of the room-temperature orthorhombic unit cell. This material also shows a high ZT of 2.3 +/- 0.3 along thec axis but a significantly reduced ZT of 0.8 +/- 0.2 along the a axis. We attribute the remarkably high ZT along the b axis to the intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in SnSe. The layered structure of SnSe derives from a distorted rock-salt structure, and features anomalously high Gruneisen parameters, which reflect the anharmonic and anisotropic bonding. We attribute the exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity (0.2 +/- 0.03 Wm(-1) K-1 at 973 K) in SnSe to the anharmonicity. These findings highlight alternative strategies to nanostructuring for achieving high thermoelectric performance.","[Zhao, Li-Dong; Tan, Gangjian; Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lo, Shih-Han; Zhang, Yongsheng; Wolverton, C.; Dravid, Vinayak P.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Sun, Hui; Uher, Ctirad] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Kanatzidis, MG (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",m-kanatzidis@northwestern.edu,"Wolverton, Christopher/B-7542-2009; Dravid, Vinayak/B-6688-2009; Tan, Gangjian/M-3509-2014; Sun, Hui/D-3411-2014","Tan, Gangjian/0000-0002-9087-4048; Sun, Hui/0000-0002-9745-3510","Revolutionary Materials for Solid State Energy Conversion; Energy Frontier Research Center; US Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-SC0001054]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0001054]; NSF-NSEC; Keck Foundation; State of Illinois; Northwestern University; NSF-MRSEC","This work was supported in part by Revolutionary Materials for Solid State Energy Conversion, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, and Office of Basic Energy Sciences under award number DE-SC0001054 (L.-D.Z., S.-H.L., Y.Z., H.S., G.T., C.U., C.W., V.P.D. and M.G.K.).

For instance, Chinese and Brazilian subtropical speleothem (cave formations such as stalactites and stalagmites) records show opposite trends in time series of oxygen isotopes (a proxy for precipitation variability) at millennial to orbital timescales(2,3), suggesting that hydrologic cycles were antiphased in the northerly versus southerly subtropics. This tropical to subtropical hydrologic phenomenon is likely to be an initial and important climatic response to orbital forcing(3). The impacts of such an interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw on higher-latitude regions and the global climate system, however, are unknown. Here we show that the antiphasing seen in the tropical records is also present in both hemispheres of the mid-latitude western Pacific Ocean. Our results are based on a new 550,000-year record of the growth frequency of speleothems from the Korean peninsula, which we compare to Southern Hemisphere equivalents(4). The Korean data are discontinuous and derived from 24 separate speleothems, but still allow the identification of periods of peak speleothem growth and, thus, precipitation. The clear hemispheric antiphasing indicates that the sphere of influence of the interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw over the past 550,000 years extended at least to the mid-latitudes, such as northeast Asia, and that orbital-timescale ITCZshifts can have serious effects on temperate climate systems. Furthermore, our result implies that insolationdriven ITCZ dynamics may provoke water vapour and vegetation feedbacks in northern mid-latitude regions and could have regulated global climate conditions throughout the late Quaternary ice age cycles.","[Jo, Kyoung-nam; Yi, Sangheon; Yang, Dong Yoon] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Taejon 305350, South Korea; [Woo, Kyung Sik] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Geol, Gangwondo 200701, South Korea; [Lim, Hyoun Soo] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Wang, Yongjin] Nanjing Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Nanjing 210097, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Hai] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Global Environm Change, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Hai; Edwards, R.

Among echolocating vertebrates, odontocetes are unique in producing high-frequency vocalizations at the phonic lips, a constriction in the nasal passages just beneath the blowhole, and then using air sinuses and the melon to modulate their transmission(2,3). Allextant odontocetes seem to echolocate(2,4); however, exactly when and how this complex behaviour-and its underlying anatomy-evolved is largely unknown. Here we report an odontocete fossil, Oligocene in age (approximately 28 Myr ago), from South Carolina (Cotylocara macei, gen. et sp. nov.) that has several features suggestive of echolocation: a dense, thick and downturned rostrum; air sac fossae; cranial asymmetry; and exceptionally broad maxillae. Our phylogenetic analysis places Cotylocara in a basal clade of odontocetes, leading us to infer that a rudimentary form of echolocation evolved in the early Oligocene, shortly after odontocetes diverged from the ancestors of filter-feedingwhales (mysticetes). This was followed by enlargement of the facial muscles that modulate echolocation calls, which in turn led to marked, convergent changes in skull shape in the ancestors of Cotylocara, and in the lineage leading to extant odontocetes.","[Geisler, Jonathan H.] New York Inst Technol, Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Anat, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA; [Colbert, Matthew W.] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Carew, James L.] Coll Charleston, Nat Hist Museum, Dept Geol & Environm Geosci, Charleston, SC 29424 USA","Geisler, JH (reprint author), New York Inst Technol, Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Anat, Northern Blvd, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA.",jgeisler@nyit.edu,,,"New York Institute of Technology, College of Charleston; NSF [IIS-987-4781]","This research was supported by funds from the New York Institute of Technology, College of Charleston, and M.

Such 'wet programming'is positioned to transform a wide and diverse swathe of biotechnology ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to water treatment strategies. Although progress in the development of a library of genetic modules continues apace(1-4), a major challenge for their integration into larger circuits is the generation of sufficiently fast and precise communication between modules(5,6). Anattractive approach is to integrate engineered circuits with host processes that facilitate robust cellular signalling(7). In this context, recent studies have demonstrated that bacterial protein degradation can trigger a precise response to stress by overloading a limited supply of intracellular proteases(8-10). Here we use protease competition to engineer rapid and tunable coupling of genetic circuits across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We characterize coupling delay times that are more than an order of magnitude faster than standard transcription factor- based coupling methods (less than 1 min compared with 2040 min) and demonstrate tunability through manipulation of the linker between the protein and its degradation tag. We use this mechanism as a platform to couple genetic clocks at the intracellular and colony level, then synchronize the multi-colony dynamics to reduce variability in both clocks. We show how the coupled clock network can be used to encode independent environmental inputs into a single time series output, thus enabling frequency multiplexing (information transmitted on a common channel by distinct frequencies) in a genetic circuit context. Our results establish a general framework for the rapid and tunable coupling of genetic circuits through the use of native `queueing' processes such as competitive protein degradation.","[Prindle, Arthur; Selimkhanov, Jangir; Li, Howard; Razinkov, Ivan; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Hasty, J (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,,,National Science Foundation [MCB-1121748]; San Diego Center for Systems Biology (NIH) [P50 GM085764]; US Department of Defense National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (MCB-1121748) and by the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (NIH Grant P50 GM085764) and the US Department of Defense National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (A.P.).

Little is known, however, about how forces produced near the apical surface of the tissue are transmitted within individual cells to generate the global changes in cell shape that characterize tissue deformation. Here we apply particle tracking velocimetry in gastrulating Drosophila embryos to measure the movement of cytoplasm and plasma membrane during ventral furrow formation(2,3). We find that cytoplasmic redistribution during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation can be precisely described by viscous flows that quantitatively match the predictions of hydrodynamics. Cell membranes move with the ambient cytoplasm, with little resistance to, or driving force on, the flow. Strikingly, apical constriction produces similar flow patterns in mutant embryos that fail to form cells before gastrulation ('acellular' embryos), such that the global redistribution of cytoplasm mirrors the summed redistribution occurring in individual cells of wild-type embryos. Our results indicate that during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation, hydrodynamic behaviour of the cytoplasm provides the predominant mechanism transmitting apically generated forces deep into the tissue and that cell individualization is dispensable.

Their diversity and similarities with previously characterized natural killer (NK) cells and lymphoid tissue inducers (LTi) have prompted a provisional classification of all innate lymphocytes into groups 1, 2 and 3 solely on the basis of cytokine properties(10), but their developmental pathways and lineage relationships remain elusive. Here we identify and characterize a novel subset of lymphoid precursors in mouse fetal liver and adult bone marrow that transiently express high amounts of PLZF, a transcription factor previously associated with NK T cell development(11,12), by using lineage tracing and transfer studies. PLZF(high) cells were committed ILC progenitors with multiple ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 potential at the clonal level. They excluded classical LTi and NK cells, but included a peculiar subset of NK1.1(+)DX5(-) 'NK-like' cells residing in the liver. Deletion of PLZF markedly altered the development of several ILC subsets, but not LTi or NK cells.

Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref. 1). Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule. We provide additional pharmacological characterizations supporting the potential development of BCX4430 as a countermeasure against human filovirus diseases and other viral diseases representing major public health threats.","[Warren, Travis K.; Wells, Jay; Panchal, Rekha G.; Stuthman, Kelly S.; Garza, Nicole L.; Van Tongeren, Sean A.; Dong, Lian; Retterer, Cary J.; Eaton, Brett P.; Pegoraro, Gianluca; Honnold, Shelley; Welch, Lisa S.; Bavari, Sina] US Army Med Res Inst Infect Dis USAMRIID, Therapeut Discovery Ctr, Div Mol & Translat Sci, Ft Detrick, MD 21702 USA; [Bantia, Shanta; Kotian, Pravin; Chen, Xilin; Taubenheim, Brian R.; Babu, Yarlagadda S.; Sheridan, William P.] BioCryst Pharmaceut Inc, Durham, NC 27703 USA; [Minning, Dena M.] MedExpert Consulting Inc, Indialantic, FL 32903 USA","Bavari, S (reprint author), US Army Med Res Inst Infect Dis USAMRIID, Therapeut Discovery Ctr, Div Mol & Translat Sci, Ft Detrick, MD 21702 USA.",sina.bavari.civ@mail.mil,,"Pegoraro, Gianluca/0000-0003-2843-9464; Sheridan, William/0000-0001-8320-1323","Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency [TMTI0048_09_RD_T, CB3675]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [HHSN272201100019I]; BioQual Inc. under NIAID [HHSN27220110005I]; University of Alabama Birmingham under NIAID [HHSN272201100016I]","J.

Caenorhabditis elegans normally responds to mitochondrial dysfunction with activation of mitochondrial-repair, drug-detoxification and pathogen-response pathways(1-7). Here, from a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified 45 C. elegans genes that are required to upregulate detoxification, pathogen-response and mitochondrial-repair pathways after inhibition of mitochondrial function by drug-induced or genetic disruption. Animals defective in ceramide biosynthesis are deficient in mitochondrial surveillance, and addition of particular ceramides can rescue the surveillance defects. Ceramide can also rescue the mitochondrial surveillance defects of other gene inactivations, mapping these gene activities upstream of ceramide. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, either by RNAi or statin drugs, also disrupts mitochondrial surveillance. Growth of C. elegans with a significant fraction of bacterial species from their natural habitat causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Other bacterial species inhibit C. elegans defence responses to a mitochondrial toxin, revealing bacterial countermeasures to animal defence.","[Liu, Ying; Samuel, Buck S.; Breen, Peter C.; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Liu, Ying; Samuel, Buck S.; Breen, Peter C.; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Ruvkun, G (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Samuel, Buck/0000-0002-4347-3997",Helen Hay Whitney research fellowship; Charles King Trust postdoctoral fellowship; National Institutes of Health [NIH AG043184-16],"We thank C.

Transposons can also give rise to abundant 21-nucleotide 'epigenetically activated' small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) in DECREASED DNA METHYLATION 1 (ddm1) and DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (met1) mutants, as well as in the vegetative nucleus of pollen grains(5) and in dedifferentiated plant cell cultures(6). Here we show that easiRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana resemble secondary siRNAs, in that thousands of transposon transcripts are specifically targeted by more than 50 miRNAs for cleavage and processing by RDR6. Loss of RDR6, DCL4 or DCL1 in a ddm1 background results in loss of 21-nucleotide easiRNAs and severe infertility, but 24-nucleotide hetsi-RNAs are partially restored, supporting an antagonistic relationship between PTGS and TGS. Thus miRNA-directed easiRNA biogenesis is a latent mechanism that specifically targets transposon transcripts, but only when they are epigenetically reactivated during reprogramming of the germ line. This ancient recognition mechanism may have been retained both by transposons to evade long-term heterochromatic silencing and by their hosts for genome defence.","[Creasey, Kate M.; Borges, Filipe; Van Ex, Frederic; Regulski, Michael; Martienssen, Robert A.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Zhai, Jixian; Meyers, Blake C.] Univ Delaware, Delaware Biotechnol Inst, Newark, DC 19711 USA; [Zhai, Jixian; Meyers, Blake C.] Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DC 19711 USA; [Martienssen, Robert A.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Martienssen, Robert A.] IBENS, Chaire Blaise Pascal, F-75230 Paris, France","Martienssen, RA (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",martiens@cshl.edu,"Meyers, Blake/B-6535-2012","Meyers, Blake/0000-0003-3436-6097; Borges, Filipe/0000-0002-7388-2118",DuPont Pioneer; Belgian American Educational Foundation; University of Delaware Graduate fellowship; National Institutes of Health [RO1GM067014]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF3033]; Cancer Center Support Grant [5PP30CA045508],"We thank V.

These enzyme complexes unwind and digest the DNA duplex from the broken end until they encounter a chi sequence(5), whereupon they produce a 3' single-stranded DNA tail onto which they initiate loading of the RecA protein(6). Consequently, regulation of the AddAB/RecBCD complex by chi is a key control point in DNA repair and other processes involving genetic recombination. Here we report crystal structures of Bacillus subtilis AddAB in complex with different chi-containing DNA substrates either with or without a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. Comparison of these structures suggests a mechanism for DNA translocation and unwinding, suggests how the enzyme binds specifically to chi sequences, and explains how chi recognition leads to the arrest of AddAB (and RecBCD) translocation that is observed in single-molecule experiments(7-9).","[Krajewski, Wojciech W.; Fu, Xin; Wilkinson, Martin; Cronin, Nora B.; Wigley, Dale B.] Chester Beatty Labs, Inst Canc Res, Div Struct Biol, London SW3 6JB, England; [Dillingham, Mark S.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biochem, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England","Wigley, DB (reprint author), Chester Beatty Labs, Inst Canc Res, Div Struct Biol, 237 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",Dale.Wigley@icr.ac.uk,,"Dillingham, Mark/0000-0002-4612-7141",Royal Society; Wellcome Trust; European Research Council; Cancer Research UK; EMBO,"We thank the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and Diamond synchrotrons for access to beamlines.

Cytoarchitectural differences between human and mouse have molecular correlates, including species differences in gene expression in subplate, although surprisingly we find minimal differences between the inner and outer subventricular zones even though the outer zone is expanded in humans. Both germinal and post-mitotic cortical layers exhibit fronto-temporal gradients, with particular enrichment in the frontal lobe.

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.","[Oh, Seung Wook; Harris, Julie A.; Ng, Lydia; Winslow, Brent; Cain, Nicholas; Mihalas, Stefan; Wang, Quanxin; Lau, Chris; Kuan, Leonard; Henry, Alex M.; Mortrud, Marty T.; Ouellette, Benjamin; Nguyen, Thuc Nghi; Sorensen, Staci A.; Slaughterbeck, Clifford R.; Wakeman, Wayne; Li, Yang; Feng, David; Ho, Anh; Nicholas, Eric; Hirokawa, Karla E.; Bohn, Phillip; Joines, Kevin M.; Peng, Hanchuan; Hawrylycz, Michael J.; Phillips, John W.; Hohmann, John G.; Wohnoutka, Paul; Koch, Christof; Bernard, Amy; Dang, Chinh; Jones, Allan R.; Zeng, Hongkui] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Gerfen, Charles R.] NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Zeng, HK (reprint author), Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",,,"Nguyen, Thuc Nghi/0000-0002-6466-5883; Koch, Christof/0000-0001-6482-8067",Allen Institute for Brain Science,"We wish to thank the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas Advisory Council members, D.

The MTH1 protein sanitizes oxidized dNTP pools to prevent incorporation of damaged bases during DNA replication. Although MTH1 is non-essential in normal cells, we show that cancer cells require MTH1 activity to avoid incorporation of oxidized dNTPs, resulting in DNA damage and cell death. We validate MTH1 as an anticancer target in vivo and describe small molecules TH287 and TH588 as first-in-class nudix hydrolase family inhibitors that potently and selectively engage and inhibit the MTH1 protein in cells. Protein co-crystal structures demonstrate that the inhibitors bindin the active site of MTH1. The inhibitors cause incorporation of oxidized dNTPs in cancer cells, leading to DNA damage, cytotoxicity and therapeutic responses in patient-derived mouse xenografts.

Cellular models of RAS-dependent cancers have been used to identify experimental small molecules, such as SCH51344, but their molecular mechanism of action remains generally unknown. Here, using a chemical proteomic approach, we identify the target of SCH51344 as the human mutT homologue MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a nucleotide pool sanitizing enzyme. Loss-of-function of MTH1 impaired growth of KRAS tumour cells, whereas MTH1 overexpression mitigated sensitivity towards SCH51344. Searching for more drug-like inhibitors, we identified the kinase inhibitor crizotinib as a nanomolar suppressor of MTH1 activity. Surprisingly, the clinically used (R)-enantiomer of the drug was inactive, whereas the (S)-enantiomer selectively inhibited MTH1 catalytic activity. Enzymatic assays, chemical proteomic profiling, kinome-wide activity surveys and MTH1 co-crystal structures of both enantiomers provide a rationale for this remarkable stereospecificity. Disruption of nucleotide pool homeostasis via MTH1 inhibition by (S)-crizotinib induced an increase in DNA single-strand breaks, activated DNA repair in human colon carcinoma cells, and effectively suppressed tumour growth in animal models. Our results propose (S)-crizotinib as an attractive chemical entity for further pre-clinical evaluation, and small-molecule inhibitors of MTH1 in general as a promising novel class of anticancer agents.","[Huber, Kilian V.

Regolith generation has traditionally been attributed to the fall back of impact ejecta and by the break-up of boulders by micrometeoroid impact(4,5). Laboratory experiments(6) and impact models(4), however, show that crater ejecta velocities are typically greater than several tens of centimetres per second, which corresponds to the gravitational escape velocity of kilometre-sized asteroids. Therefore, impact debris cannot be the main source of regolith on small asteroids(4). Here we report that thermal fatigue(7-9), a mechanism of rock weathering and fragmentation with no subsequent ejection, is the dominant process governing regolith generation on small asteroids. We find that thermal fragmentation induced by the diurnal temperature variations breaks up rocks larger than a few centimetres more quickly than do micrometeoroid impacts. Because thermal fragmentation is independent of asteroid size, this process can also contribute to regolith production on larger asteroids.

Two particularly promising applications have been explored during the past decade: photon-based quantum communication, which guarantees unbreakable encryption(1) but which still has to be scaled to high rates over large distances, and quantum computation, which will fundamentally enhance computability(2) if it can be scaled to a large number of quantum bits (qubits). It was realized early on that a hybrid system of light qubits and matter qubits(3) could solve the scalability problem of each field-that of communication by use of quantum repeaters4, and that of computation by use of an optical interconnect between smaller quantum processors(5,6). To this end, the development of a robust two-qubit gate that allows the linking of distant computational nodes is ""a pressing challenge""(6). Here we demonstrate such a quantum gate between the spin state of a single trapped atom and the polarization state of an optical photon contained in a faint laser pulse. The gate mechanism presented(7,8) is deterministic and robust, and is expected to be applicable to almost any matter qubit. It is based on reflection of the photonic qubit from a cavity that provides strong light-matter coupling. To demonstrate its versatility, we use the quantum gate to create atom-photon, atom-photon-photon and photon-photon entangled states from separable input states. We expect our experiment to enable various applications, including the generation of atomic(9) and photonic(10) cluster states and Schrodinger-cat states(11), deterministic photonic Bell-state measurements(12), scalable quantum computation(7) and quantum communication using a redundant quantum parity code(13).","[Reiserer, Andreas; Kalb, Norbert; Rempe, Gerhard; Ritter, Stephan] Max Planck Inst Quanten Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Rempe, G (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quanten Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",gerhard.rempe@mpq.mpg.de,"Reiserer, Andreas/J-3243-2014; Ritter, Stephan/F-1579-2010; Reiserer, Andreas/G-4980-2017","Reiserer, Andreas/0000-0001-9595-7363; Ritter, Stephan/0000-0001-9002-7407; Reiserer, Andreas/0000-0001-9595-7363",European Union; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [IKT 2020],This work was supported by the European Union (Collaborative Project SIQS) and by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung via IKT 2020 (QK_QuOReP).,,30,115,115,8,99,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Apr,2014,508,7495,,,,,237,+,,10.1038/nature13177,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AE4UK,WOS:000333979900042,24717512,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here, by strongly coupling a photon to a single atom trapped in the near field of a nanoscale photonic crystal cavity, we realize a system in which a single atom switches the phase of a photon and a single photon modifies the atom's phase. We experimentally demonstrate an atom-induced optical phase shift(8) that is nonlinear at the two-photon level(9), a photon number router that separates individual photons and photon pairs into different output modes(10), and a single-photon switch in which a single 'gate' photon controls the propagation of a subsequent probe field(11,12).

The accretionary mountain belts (orogens) that format these convergent plate margins have been the principal sites of lateral continental growth through Earth's history. Modern examples of accretionary margins are the North American Cordilleras and southwest Pacific subduction zones. The geologic record contains abundant accretionary orogens, such as the Tasmanides(1), along the eastern margin of the supercontinent Gondwana, and the Altaides, which formed on the southern margin of Laurasia(2). In modern and ancient examples of long-lived accretionary orogens, the overriding plate is subjected to episodes of crustal extension and back-arc basin development, often related to subduction rollback(3) and transient episodes of orogenesis and crustal shortening(4-7), coincident with accretion of exotic crust. Here we present three-dimensional dynamic models that show how accretionary margins evolve from the initial collision, through a period of plate margin instability, to re-establishment of a stable convergent margin. The models illustrate how significant curvature of the orogenic system develops, as well as the mechanism for tectonic escape of the back-arc region. The complexity of the morphology and the evolution of the system are caused by lateral rollback of a tightly arcuate trench migrating parallel to the plate boundary and orthogonally to the convergence direction. We find geological and geophysical evidence for this process in the Tasmanides of eastern Australia, and infer that this is a recurrent and global phenomenon.","[Moresi, L.; Betts, P.

The extent to which epistasis influences complex traits(1) and contributes to their variation(2,3) is a fundamental question in evolution andhuman genetics. Although oftendemonstrated in artificial gene manipulation studies in model organisms(4,5), and some examples have been reported in other species(6), few examples exist for epistasis among natural polymorphisms in human traits(7,8). Its absence from empirical findingsmay simply be due to low incidence in the genetic control of complex traits(2,3), but an alternative view is that it has previously been too technically challenging to detect owing to statistical and computational issues(9). Here we show, using advanced computation(10) and a gene expression study design, that many instances of epistasis are found between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In a cohort of 846 individualswith 7,339 gene expression levels measured in peripheral blood, we found 501 significant pairwise interactions between commonSNPs influencing the expression of 238 genes (P < 2.91 x 10(-16)). Replication of these interactions in two independent data sets11,12 showed both concordance of direction of epistatic effects (P = 55.5 x 10(-31)) and enrichment of interaction P values, with 30 being significant at a conservative threshold of P < 9.98 x 10(-5). Forty-four of the genetic interactions are located within 5 megabases of regions of known physical chromosome interactions(13) (P=1.8x10(-10)). Epistatic networks of three SNPs or more influence the expression levels of 129 genes, whereby one cis-acting SNP is modulated by several trans-acting SNPs. For example, MBNL1 is influenced by an additive effect at rs13069559, which itself is masked by trans-SNPs on 14 different chromosomes, with nearly identical genotype-phenotype maps for each cis-trans interaction. This study presents the first evidence, to our knowledge, for many instances of segregating common polymorphisms interacting to influence human traits.","[Hemani, Gibran; Shakhbazov, Konstantin; McRae, Allan F.; Yang, Jian; Visscher, Peter M.; Powell, Joseph E.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hemani, Gibran; Shakhbazov, Konstantin; McRae, Allan F.; Visscher, Peter M.; Powell, Joseph E.] Univ Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hosp, Diamantina Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Westra, Harm-Jan; Franke, Lude] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Genet, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Esko, Tonu; Metspalu, Andres] Univ Tartu, Estonian Genome Ctr, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Esko, Tonu] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Esko, Tonu] Childrens Hosp, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Henders, Anjali K.; Martin, Nicholas G.; Montgomery, Grant W.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia; [Gibson, Greg] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Gibson, Greg] Georgia Inst Technol, Ctr Integrat Genom, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Hemani, G (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",g.hemani@uq.edu.au,"; Powell, Joseph/G-3027-2014; McRae, Allan/J-2644-2014; Montgomery, Grant/B-7148-2008; Franke, Lude/P-7036-2016; Yang, Jian/A-5852-2010","Martin, Nicholas/0000-0003-4069-8020; Esko, Tonu/0000-0003-1982-6569; Henders, Anjali/0000-0003-3672-1451; Visscher, Peter/0000-0002-2143-8760; Powell, Joseph/0000-0001-9031-6356; McRae, Allan/0000-0001-5286-5485; Montgomery, Grant/0000-0002-4140-8139; Franke, Lude/0000-0002-5159-8802; Yang, Jian/0000-0003-2001-2474","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [389892, 496667, 613601, 1010374, 1046880]; Australian Research Council (ARC) [DE130100691]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM057091, GM099568]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [389892, 241944, 389875, 389891, 389938, 442915, 442981, 496739, 496688, 552485]; National Institutes of Health [AA07535, AA10248, AA014041, AA13320, AA13321, AA13326, DA12854]; Georgia Institute of Technology Research Foundation; Celiac Disease Consortium [BSIK03009]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [918.66.620, 916.10.135]; Dutch Digestive Disease Foundation [MLDS WO11-30]; Horizon Breakthrough grant from the Netherlands Genomics Initiative [92519031]; Prinses Beatrix Fonds; VSB fonds; Kersten Foundation; Netherlands ALS Foundation; J.

However, the factors that mediate the emergence of RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) are still incompletely understood(2,3). Phylogenetic inference is crucial to reconstructing the origins and tracing the flow of IAV within and between hosts(3-8). Here we show that explicitly allowing IAV host lineages to have independent rates of molecular evolution is necessary for reliable phylogenetic inference of IAV and that methods that do not do so, including 'relaxed' molecular clock models(9), can be positively misleading. A phylogenomic analysis using a host-specific local clock model recovers extremely consistent evolutionary histories across all genomic segments and demonstrates that the equine H7N7 lineage is a sister clade to strains from birds-as well as those from humans, swine and the equine H3N8 lineage-sharing an ancestor with them in the mid to late 1800s. Moreover, major western and eastern hemisphere avian influenza lineages inferred for each gene coalesce in the late 1800s. On the basis of these phylogenies and the synchrony of these key nodes, we infer that the internal genes of avian influenza virus (AIV) underwent a global selective sweep beginning in the late 1800s, a process that continued throughout the twentieth century and up to the present. The resulting western hemispheric AIV lineage subsequently contributed most of the genomic segments to the 1918 pandemic virus and, independently, the 1963 equine H3N8 panzootic lineage. This approach provides a clear resolution of evolutionary patterns and processes in IAV, including the flow of viral genes and genomes within and between host lineages.","[Worobey, Michael; Han, Guan-Zhu] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rambaut, Andrew] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Rambaut, Andrew] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Worobey, M (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",worobey@email.arizona.edu; a.rambaut@ed.ac.uk,"Han, Guan-Zhu/A-6818-2011","Rambaut, Andrew/0000-0003-4337-3707",David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Wellcome Trust [092807]; European Union [278433-PREDEMICS]; European Research Council [260864]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI084691],"We thank J.

Adipose-specific knockout or overexpression of Glut4 alters systemic insulin sensitivity(2). Here we show, using DNA array analyses, that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) is the most strongly reciprocally regulated gene when comparing gene expression in white adipose tissue(WAT) from adipose-specific Glut4k-nockout or adipose-specific Glut4-overexpressing mice with their respective controls. NNMT methylates nicotinamide (vitamin B3) using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor(3,4). Nicotinamide is a precursor of NAD(+), an important cofactor linking cellular redox states with energy metabolism(5). SAM provides propylamine for polyamine biosynthesis and donates a methyl group for histone methylation(6). Polyamine flux including synthesis, catabolism and excretion, is controlled by the rate-limiting enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and spermidine-spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SSAT; encoded by Sat1) and by polyamine oxidase (PAO), and has a major role in energy metabolism(7,8). We report that NNMT expression is increased in WAT and liver of obese and diabetic mice. Nnmt knockdown in WAT and liver protects against diet-induced obesity by augmenting cellular energy expenditure. NNMT inhibition increases adipose SAM and NAD(+) levels and upregulates ODC and SSAT activity as well as expression, owing to the effects of NNMT on histone H3 lysine 4 methylation in adipose tissue. Direct evidence for increased polyamine flux resulting from NNMT inhibition includes elevated urinary excretion and adipocyte secretion of diacetylspermine, a product of polyamine metabolism. NNMT inhibition in adipocytes increases oxygen consumption in an ODC-, SSAT- and PAO-dependent manner. Thus, NNMT is a novel regulator of histone methylation, polyamine flux and NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 signalling, and is a unique and attractive target for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.","[Kraus, Daniel; Yang, Qin; Kong, Dong; Zhang, Lin; Pulinilkunnil, Thomas C.; Gong, Fengying; Wang, Ya-chin; Peroni, Odile D.; Kahn, Barbara B.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kraus, Daniel; Yang, Qin; Kong, Dong; Zhang, Lin; Pulinilkunnil, Thomas C.; Gong, Fengying; Wang, Ya-chin; Asara, John M.; Peroni, Odile D.; Kahn, Barbara B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Banks, Alexander S.; Rodgers, Joseph T.; Puigserver, Pere] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pirinen, Eija; Alhonen, Leena] Univ Eastern Finland, Bioctr Kuopio, AI Virtanen Inst Mol Sci, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Cen, Yana; Sauve, Anthony A.] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Asara, John M.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Signal Transduct, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Monia, Brett P.; Bhanot, Sanjay] ISIS Pharmaceut, Carlsbad, CA 92008 USA","Kahn, BB (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, 330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",qin.yang@uci.edu; bkahn@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Cen, Yana/F-4731-2014; Pirinen, Eija/H-9153-2015; Banks, Alexander/B-4832-2012; Pulinilkunnil, Thomas/L-5511-2016","Cen, Yana/0000-0001-6436-5744; Pirinen, Eija/0000-0003-1495-3972; Banks, Alexander/0000-0003-1787-6925; Pulinilkunnil, Thomas/0000-0003-1228-893X","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KR 3475/1-1]; American Heart Association (AHA) [09POST2250499]; NIH [R37 DK43051, P30 DK57521, KO8 DK090149, R01 DK100385, BNORC P30 DK046200, NORCH P30 DK040561]; JPB foundation; AHA [13SDG14620005, PF P30 DK0460200]; Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholar in Aging Award; academy of Finland [118590];  [RO1 DK69966];  [P01CA120964];  [P30CA006516-46]","We thank R.

H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions after RNA polymerase II elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin to a relatively repressive state, thus suppressing cryptic transcription(2). However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. This is further complicated by the transcription-coupled incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 in gene bodies(3). Here we show that the candidate tumour suppressor ZMYND11 specifically recognizes H3K36me3 on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) and regulates RNA polymerase II elongation. Structural studies show that in addition to the trimethyl-lysine binding by an aromatic cage within the PWWP domain, the H3.3-dependent recognition is mediated by the encapsulation of the H3.3-specific 'Ser 31' residue in a composite pocket formed by the tandem bromo-PWWP domains of ZMYND11. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing shows a genome-wide co-localization of ZMYND11 with H3K36me3 and H3.3 in gene bodies, and its occupancy requires the pre-deposition of H3.3K36me3. Although ZMYND11 is associated with highly expressed genes, it functions as an unconventional transcription corepressor by modulating RNA polymerase II at the elongation stage. ZMYND11 is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for tumour cell growth; low expression levels of ZMYND11 in breast cancer patients correlate with worse prognosis. Consistently, overexpression of ZMYND11 suppresses cancer cell growth in vitro and tumour formation in mice. Together, this study identifies ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific reader of H3K36me3 that links the histone-variant-mediated transcription elongation control to tumour suppression.","[Wen, Hong; Jiang, Shiming; Stratton, Sabrina; Peng, Danni; Tanaka, Kaori; Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wen, Hong; Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Canc Epigenet, Ctr Genet & Genom, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wen, Hong; Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Stem Cell & Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Li, Yuanyuan; Ren, Yongfeng; Li, Haitao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, MOE Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuanyuan; Ren, Yongfeng; Li, Haitao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Dept Basic Med Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xi, Yuanxin; Xia, Zheng; Li, Wei] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wu, Jun; Li, Bing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Genes & Dev Grad Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Shi, XB (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",hwen@mdanderson.org; WL1@bcm.edu; lht@tsinghua.edu.cn; xbshi@mdanderson.org,"Xia, Zheng/F-6561-2014; Li, Haitao/B-2668-2012","Xia, Zheng/0000-0003-3364-8324; Li, Haitao/0000-0001-6741-293X; Barton, Michelle/0000-0002-4042-1374; Shi, Xiaobing/0000-0001-5242-8189; Wen, Hong/0000-0001-8739-4572",American Cancer Society [RSG-13-290-01-TBE]; National institutes of Health (NIH)/MDACC [CCSG CA016672]; Major State Basic Research Development Program in China [2011CB965300]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2012M510413]; Kimmel Scholar Award;  [CPRITRP110471];  [Welch G1719];  [NIH R01HG007538];  [NIH R01GM090077];  [Welch I1713],"We thank J.

Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is commonly thought to be a shared niche characteristic in maintaining quiescence in multiple stem cell types(2-4). However, support for the existence of a hypoxic niche has largely come from indirect evidence such as proteomic analysis(5), expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha) and related genes(6), and staining with surrogate hypoxic markers (for example, pimonidazole)(6-8). Here we perform direct in vivo measurements of local oxygen tension (p(O2)) in the bone marrow of live mice. Using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy, we determined the absolute p(O2) of the bone marrow to be quite low (<32 mm Hg) despite very high vascular density. We further uncovered heterogeneities in local p(O2), with the lowest p(O2) (similar to 9.9 mm Hg, or 1.3%) found in deeper peri-sinusoidal regions. The endosteal region, by contrast, is less hypoxic as it is perfused with small arteries that are often positive for the marker nestin. These p(O2) values change markedly after radiation and chemotherapy, pointing to the role of stress in altering the stem cell metabolic microenvironment.","[Spencer, Joel A.; Roussakis, Emmanuel; Wu, Juwell; Runnels, Judith M.; Zaher, Walid; Mortensen, Luke J.; Alt, Clemens; Turcotte, Raphael; Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Wellman Ctr Photomed, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Spencer, Joel A.; Wu, Juwell; Runnels, Judith M.; Zaher, Walid; Mortensen, Luke J.; Alt, Clemens; Turcotte, Raphael; Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Spencer, Joel A.] Tufts Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Ferraro, Francesca; Klein, Alyssa; Yusuf, Rushdia; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ferraro, Francesca; Klein, Alyssa; Yusuf, Rushdia; Scadden, David T.; Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ferraro, Francesca; Klein, Alyssa; Yusuf, Rushdia; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Roussakis, Emmanuel; Vinogradov, Sergei A.] Univ Penn, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Zaher, Walid] King Saud Univ, Coll Med, Dept Anat, Stem Cell Unit, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia; [Turcotte, Raphael] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cote, Daniel] Univ Laval, Dept Phys Genie Phys & Opt, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; [Cote, Daniel] Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Inst Univ Sante Mentale Quebec, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada","Lin, CP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Wellman Ctr Photomed, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",charles_lin@hms.harvard.edu,,"Mortensen, Luke/0000-0002-4331-4099","US National Institutes of Health [HL097748, EB017274, HL097794, HL096372, EB014703]","We thank S.

Whether blood flow is controlled solely by arteriole smooth muscle, or also by capillary pericytes, is controversial. We demonstrate that neuronal activity and the neurotransmitter glutamate evoke the release of messengers that dilate capillaries by actively relaxing pericytes. Dilation is mediated by prostaglandin E-2, but requires nitric oxide release to suppress vasoconstricting 20-HETE synthesis. In vivo, when sensory input increases blood flow, capillaries dilate before arterioles and are estimated to produce 84% of the blood flow increase. In pathology, ischaemia evokes capillary constriction by pericytes. We show that this is followed by pericyte death in rigor, which may irreversibly constrict capillaries and damage the blood-brain barrier. Thus, pericytes are major regulators of cerebral blood flow and initiators of functional imaging signals. Prevention of pericyte constriction and death may reduce the long-lasting blood flow decrease that damages neurons after stroke.","[Hall, Catherine N.; Reynell, Clare; Hamilton, Nicola B.; Mishra, Anusha; O'Farrell, Fergus M.; Attwell, David] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gesslein, Bodil; Lauritzen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Neurosci & Pharmacol, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Gesslein, Bodil; Lauritzen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Hlth Aging, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Sutherland, Brad A.; Buchan, Alastair M.] Univ Oxford, Radcliffe Dept Med, Acute Stroke Programme, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Lauritzen, Martin] Glostrup Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark","Attwell, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",mlauritz@sund.ku.dk; d.attwell@ucl.ac.uk,"; Sutherland, Brad/J-3920-2014; Buchan, Alastair/B-9095-2009; Hall, Catherine/A-5802-2016; Hamilton-Whitaker, Nicola/H-8867-2012","O'Farrell, Fergus/0000-0002-7378-9175; Sutherland, Brad/0000-0002-0791-0950; Lauritzen, Martin/0000-0002-1517-1131; Buchan, Alastair/0000-0002-2918-5200; Hall, Catherine/0000-0002-2316-7714; Hamilton-Whitaker, Nicola/0000-0002-0168-8068; reynell, clare/0000-0003-2733-3334",Fondation Leducq; European Research Council; Wellcome Trust; UK Medical Research Council; Rosetrees Trust; Nordea Foundation via the Center for Healthy Aging; Lundbeck Foundation; NOVO-Nordisk Foundation; Danish Medical Research Council,"We thank B.

The structures reveal that, in addition to a translocation channel, TcA forms four receptor-binding sites and a neuraminidase-like region, which are important for its host specificity. pH-induced opening of the shell releases an entropic spring that drives the injection of the TcA channel into the membrane. Binding of TcB/TcC to TcA opens a gate formed by a six-bladed beta-propeller and results in a continuous protein translocation channel, whose architecture and properties suggest a novel mode of protein unfolding and translocation.

Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA-mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.","[Subtelny, Alexander O.; Eichhorn, Stephen W.; Chen, Grace R.; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Subtelny, Alexander O.; Eichhorn, Stephen W.; Chen, Grace R.; Sive, Hazel; Bartel, David P.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Subtelny, Alexander O.; Eichhorn, Stephen W.; Chen, Grace R.; Sive, Hazel; Bartel, David P.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Subtelny, Alexander O.] MIT, Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Bartel, DP (reprint author), MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dbartel@wi.mit.edu,,,NIH [GM067031]; NIH Medical Scientist Training Program [T32GM007753],"We thank D.

Rings are natural laboratories in which to study dynamical processes analogous to those that take place during the formation of planetary systems and galaxies. Their presence also tells us about the origin and evolution of the body they encircle. Here we report observations of a multichord stellar occultation that revealed the presence of a ring system around (10199) Chariklo, which is a Centaur-that is, one of a class of small objects orbiting primarily between Jupiter and Neptune-with an equivalent radius of 124 +/- 9 kilometres (ref. 2). There are two dense rings, with respective widths of about 7 and 3 kilometres, optical depths of 0.4 and 0.06, and orbital radii of 391 and 405 kilometres. The present orientation of the ring is consistent with an edge-on geometry in 2008, which provides a simple explanation for the dimming(3) of the Chariklo system between 1997 and 2008, and for the gradual disappearance of ice and other absorption features in its spectrum over the same period(4,5). This implies that the rings are partly composed of water ice. They may be the remnants of a debris disk, possibly confined by embedded, kilometre-sized satellites.","[Braga-Ribas, F.; Vieira-Martins, R.; Camargo, J. I.

One versatile and widely applied method to cool molecules is helium buffer-gas cooling in either a supersonic beam expansion(9,10) or a cryogenic trap environment(11,12). Another more recent method applicable to trapped molecular ions relies on sympathetic translational cooling, through collisional interactions with co-trapped, laser-cooled atomic ions, into spatially ordered structures called Coulomb crystals, combined with laser-controlled internal-state preparation(6,7,13-23). Here we present experimental results on helium buffer-gas cooling of the rotational degrees of freedom of MgH+ molecular ions, which have been trapped and sympathetically cooled(13) in a cryogenic linear radio-frequency quadrupole trap. With helium collision rates of only about ten per second-that is, four to five orders of magnitude lower than in typical buffer-gas cooling settings-we have cooled a single molecular ion to a rotational temperature of 7.5(-0.7)(+0.9) kelvin, the lowest such temperature so far measured. In addition, by varying the shape of, or the number of atomic and molecular ions in, larger Coulomb crystals, or both, we have tuned the effective rotational temperature from about 7 kelvin to about 60 kelvin by changing the translational micromotion energy of the ions(24). The extremely low helium collision rate may allow for sympathetic sideband cooling of single molecular ions, and eventually make quantum-logic spectroscopy(25) of buffer-gas-cooled molecular ions feasible. Furthermore, application of the present cooling scheme to complex molecular ions should enable single- or few-state manipulations of individual molecules of biological interest(4,5).","[Hansen, A.

The recent experimental achievements in this energy range include the demonstration of parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime(1), electromagnetically induced transparency in a cavity(2), the collective Lamb shift(3), vacuum-assisted generation of atomic coherences(4) and single-photon revival in nuclear absorbing multilayer structures(5). Also, realization of single-photon coherent storage(6) and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage(7) were recently proposed in this regime. More related work is discussed in a recent review(8). However, the number of tools for the coherent manipulation of interactions between gamma-ray photons and nuclear ensembles remains limited. Here we suggest and implement an efficient method to control the waveforms of gamma-ray photons coherently. In particular, we demonstrate the conversion of individual recoilless gamma-ray photons into a coherent, ultrashort pulse train and into a double pulse. Our method is based on the resonant interaction of gamma-ray photons with an ensemble of nuclei with a resonant transition frequency that is periodically modulated in time. The frequency modulation, which is achieved by a uniform vibration of the resonant absorber, owing to the Doppler effect, renders resonant absorption and dispersion both time dependent, allowing us to shape the waveforms of the incident gamma-ray photons. We expect that this technique will lead to advances in the emerging fields of coherent and quantum gamma-ray photon optics, providing a basis for the realization of gamma-ray-photon/nuclear-ensemble interfaces and quantum interference effects at nuclear gamma-ray transitions.","[Vagizov, Farit; Antonov, Vladimir; Radeonychev, Y.

A key goal of geochemistry is to date this event, but different ages have been proposed. Some(1-3) argue for an early Moon-forming event, approximately 30 million years (Myr) after the condensation of the first solids in the Solar System, whereas others(4-6) claim a date later than 50 Myr (and possibly as late as around 100 Myr) after condensation. Here we show that a Moon-forming event at 40 Myr after condensation, or earlier, is ruled out at a 99.9 per cent confidence level. We use a large number of N-body simulations to demonstrate a relationship between the time of the last giant impact on an Earth-like planet and the amount of mass subsequently added during the era known as Late Accretion. As the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accreted mass decreases in a predictable fashion. This relationship exists within both the classical scenario(7,8) and the Grand Tack scenario(9,10) of terrestrial planet formation, and holds across a wide range of disk conditions. The concentration of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle constrains the mass of chondritic material added to Earth during Late Accretion(11,12). Using HSE abundance measurements(13,14), we determine a Moon-formation age of 95 +/- 32 Myr after condensation. The possibility exists that some late projectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete HSE record in Earth's mantle. Even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest that the late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of Earth's mass, and so the HSE clock still robustly limits the timing of the Moon-forming event to significantly later than 40 Myr after condensation.","[Jacobson, Seth A.; Morbidelli, Alessandro] Observ Cote Azur, Lab Lagrange, F-06304 Nice 4, France; [Jacobson, Seth A.; Rubie, David C.] Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Raymond, Sean N.] Univ Bordeaux, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France; [Raymond, Sean N.] CNRS, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France; [O'Brien, David P.] Planetary Sci Inst, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Walsh, Kevin J.] Planetary Sci Directorate, SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA","Jacobson, SA (reprint author), Observ Cote Azur, Lab Lagrange, Blvd Observ,BP 4229, F-06304 Nice 4, France.",seth.jacobson@oca.eu,"Jacobson, Seth/I-7029-2015","Jacobson, Seth/0000-0002-4952-9007",European Research Council [290568]; NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics research programme [NNX09AE36G]; NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory lead team; NASA [NNH05ZDA001C],"S.A.J., A.

Mnemonic information is processed in the hippocampus through several parallel routes involving distinct subregions. In the classic trisynaptic pathway, information proceeds from entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate gyrus to CA3 and then to CA1, the main hippocampal output(2). Genetic lesions of EC(ref. 3) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (ref. 4), CA3 (ref. 5) and CA1 (ref. 6) regions have revealed their distinct functions in learning and memory. In contrast, little is known about the role of CA2, a relatively small area interposed between CA3 and CA1 that forms the nexus of a powerful disynaptic circuit linking EC input with CA1 output(7). Here we report a novel transgenic mouse line that enabled us to selectively examine the synaptic connections and behavioural role of the CA2 region in adult mice. Genetically targeted inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons caused a pronounced loss of social memory-the ability of an animal to remember a conspecific-with no change in sociability or several other hippocampus-dependent behaviours, including spatial and contextual memory. These behavioural and anatomical results thus reveal CA2 as a critical hub of sociocognitive memory processing.","[Hitti, Frederick L.; Siegelbaum, Steven A.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Kavli Inst, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Siegelbaum, Steven A.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Siegelbaum, SA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Kavli Inst, Dept Neurosci, 1051 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10032 USA.",sas8@columbia.edu,,,Ruth L.

However, despite progress in advancing the differentiation of iPSCs into hepatocytes (iPSC-Heps) in vitro(1-3), cells that replicate the ability of human primary adult hepatocytes (aHeps) to proliferate extensively in vivo have not been reported. This deficiency has hampered efforts to recreate human liver diseases in mice, and has cast doubt on the potential of iPSC-Heps for liver cell therapy. The reason is that extensive post-transplant expansion is needed to establish and sustain a therapeutically effective liver cell mass in patients, a lesson learned from clinical trials of aHep transplantation(4). Here, as a solution to this problem, we report the generation of human fibroblast-derived hepatocytes that can repopulate mouse livers. Unlike current protocols for deriving hepatocytes from human fibroblasts, ours did not generate iPSCs but cut short reprogramming to pluripotency to generate an induced multipotent progenitor cell (iMPC) state from which endoderm progenitor cells and subsequently hepatocytes (iMPC-Heps) could be efficiently differentiated. For this purpose we identified small molecules that aided endoderm and hepatocyte differentiation without compromising proliferation. After transplantation into an immune-deficient mouse model of human liver failure, iMPC-Heps proliferated extensively and acquired levels of hepatocyte function similar to those of aHeps. Unfractionated iMPC-Heps did not form tumours, most probably because they never entered a pluripotent state. Our results establish the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, which removes a long-standing roadblock on the path to autologous liver cell therapy.","[Zhu, Saiyong; Ding, Sheng] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rezvani, Milad; Mattis, Aras N.; Willenbring, Holger] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Harbell, Jack; Willenbring, Holger] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Transplantat, Dept Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Mattis, Aras N.; Willenbring, Holger] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Liver, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA; [Mattis, Aras N.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wolfe, Alan R.; Benet, Leslie Z.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ding, Sheng] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Willenbring, H (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, 35 Med Ctr Way, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",willenbringh@stemcell.ucsf.edu; sheng.ding@gladstone.ucsf.edu,"Wolfe, Alan/A-6853-2009; Mattis, Aras/C-5558-2014; Benet, Leslie/K-8286-2016","Wolfe, Alan/0000-0002-0932-4146; ","California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [RN2-00950]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P30 DK26743]; CIRM [TG2-01160, TG2-01153]; NIH; Gladstone Institutes; German Academic Exchange Service","We thank the Gladstone Institutes' Bioinformatics Core for data analysis, A.

This can potentially generate correlated copy-number alterations across hundreds of linked genes, as exemplified by the 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with recurrent amplification of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21)(2,3). We used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. Here we show that individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have approximately 2,700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by a chromothripsis event involving both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome, a novel mechanism for cancer predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles are typically the initiating event, often followed by chromothripsis. In both sporadic and rob(15;21)c-associated iAMP21, the final stages frequently involve duplications of the entire abnormal chromosome. The end-product is a derivative of chromosome 21 or the rob(15;21)c chromosome with gene dosage optimized for leukaemic potential, showing constrained copy-number levels over multiple linked genes. Thus, dicentric chromosomes may be an important precipitant of chromothripsis, as we show rob(15;21) c to be constitutionally dicentric and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles generate dicentric chromosomes somatically. Furthermore, our data illustrate that several cancer-specific mutational processes, applied sequentially, can coordinate to fashion copy-number profiles over large genomic scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of aggregated gene dosage changes.","[Li, Yilong; Papaemmanuil, Elli; Joseph, Olivia; Robinson, Ben; Maddison, Mark; Stephens, Philip J.; Van Loo, Peter; Stratton, Michael R.; Campbell, Peter J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Canc Genome Project, Hinxton CB10 1SA, England; [Schwab, Claire; Ryan, Sarra L.; Moorman, Anthony V.; Young, Bryan D.; Sinclair, Paul; Rand, Vikki; Harrison, Christine J.] Newcastle Univ, Northern Inst Canc Res, Leukaemia Res Cytogenet Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Robinson, Hazel M.; Dyer, Sara; Borrow, Julian; Griffiths, Mike] Birmingham Womens NHS Fdn Trust, West Midlands Reg Genet Lab, Birmingham B15 2TG, W Midlands, England; [Jacobs, Patricia; Ross, Fiona M.] Salisbury NHS Fdn Trust, Wessex Reg Genet Lab, Salisbury SP2 8BJ, Wilts, England; [Dyer, Sara; Borrow, Julian; Griffiths, Mike] Univ Birmingham, Sch Canc Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Heerema, Nyla A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Pathol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Carroll, Andrew J.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Genet, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Talley, Polly] Sheffield Childrens NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield Diagnost Genet Serv, Sheffield S10 2TH, S Yorkshire, England; [Bown, Nick] Northern Genet Serv, Cytogenet Lab, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE7 7DN, Tyne & Wear, England; [Telford, Nick] Christie NHS Fdn Trust, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Gaunt, Lorraine] Cent Manchester Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, St Marys Hosp, Reg Cytogenet Unit, Manchester M13 9WL, Lancs, England; [McNally, Richard J.

One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein(UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours(4-6), but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)-is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options(7,8). Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44(high)CD24(low) population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs9,10. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1 alpha that regulates the expression of HIF1 alpha targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1 alpha and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and indicate that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.","[Chen, Xi; Adoro, Stanley; Song, Minkyung; Tan, Chen; Glimcher, Laurie H.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Sandra & Edward Meyer Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Chen, Xi; Adoro, Stanley; Song, Minkyung; Tan, Chen; Ferrari, Mauro; Chang, Jenny C.; Glimcher, Laurie H.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Iliopoulos, Dimitrios; Hatziapostolou, Maria] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Digest Dis, Ctr Syst Biomed, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Iliopoulos, Dimitrios; Hatziapostolou, Maria] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Qing] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Tang, Qianzi] Tongji Univ, Dept Bioinformat, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Tang, Qianzi] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Inst Anim Genet & Breeding, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Greenblatt, Matthew B.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lim, Elgene; Ni, Min; Brown, Myles] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lim, Elgene; Ni, Min; Brown, Myles] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tam, Wai Leong] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chen, Yiwen; Liu, X.

Abetter understanding of these adaptations might reveal cancer cell liabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit. Here we developed a continuous-flow culture apparatus (Nutrostat) for maintaining proliferating cells in low-nutrient media for long periods of time, and used it to undertake competitive proliferation assays on a pooled collection of barcoded cancer cell lines cultured in low-glucose conditions. Sensitivity to low glucose varies amongst cell lines, and an RNA interference (RNAi) screen pinpointed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as the major pathway required for optimal proliferation in low glucose. We found that cell lines most sensitive to low glucose are defective in the OXPHOS upregulation that is normally caused by glucose limitation as a result of either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in complex I genes or impaired glucose utilization. These defects predict sensitivity to biguanides, antidiabetic drugs that inhibit OXPHOS3,4, when cancer cells are grown in low glucose or as tumour xenografts. Notably, the biguanide sensitivity of cancer cells with mtDNA mutations was reversed by ectopic expression of yeast NDI1, a ubiquinone oxidoreductase that allows bypass of complex I function(5). Thus, we conclude that mtDNA mutations and impaired glucose utilization are potential biomarkers for identifying tumours with increased sensitivity to OXPHOS inhibitors.","[Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Lorbeer, Franziska K.; Bayraktar, Erol C.; Thiru, Prathapan; Yucel, Burcu; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Clish, Clary B.; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Clish, Clary B.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Sabatini, DM (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sabatini@wi.mit.edu,,"Chen, Walter/0000-0002-7752-9581; /0000-0002-1446-7256; Possemato, Richard/0000-0002-2401-0030","Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Jane Coffin Childs Fund; Council of Higher Education Turkey; Karadeniz T.

As carcinogenesis involves a breakdown in the cell-cell cooperation that normally maintains epithelial tissue architecture, individual subclones within a malignant microenvironment are commonly depicted as self-interested competitors(5,6). Alternatively, breast cancer subclones might interact cooperatively to gain a selective growth advantage in some cases. Although interclonal cooperation has been shown to drive tumorigenesis in fruitfly models(7,8), definitive evidence for functional cooperation between epithelial tumour cell subclones in mammals is lacking. Here we use mouse models of breast cancer to show that interclonal cooperation can be essential for tumour maintenance. Aberrant expression of the secreted signalling molecule Wnt1 generates mixed-lineage mammary tumours composed of basal and luminal tumour cell subtypes, which purportedly derive from a bipotent malignant progenitor cell residing atop a tumour cell hierarchy(9). Using somatic Hras mutations as clonal markers, we show that some Wnt tumours indeed conform to a hierarchical configuration, but that others unexpectedly harbour genetically distinct basal Hras mutant and luminal Hras wild-type subclones. Both subclones are required for efficient tumour propagation, which strictly depends on luminally produced Wnt1. When biclonal tumours were challenged with Wnt withdrawal to simulate targeted therapy, analysis of tumour regression and relapse revealed that basal subclones recruit heterologous Wnt-producing cells to restore tumour growth. Alternatively, in the absence of a substitute Wnt source, the original subclones often evolve to rescue Wnt pathway activation and drive relapse, either by restoring cooperation or by switching to a defector strategy. Uncovering similar modes of interclonal cooperation in human cancers may inform efforts aimed at eradicating tumour cell communities.","[Cleary, Allison S.; Leonard, Travis L.; Gestl, Shelley A.; Gunther, Edward J.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Labs Canc Res, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Cleary, Allison S.; Leonard, Travis L.; Gestl, Shelley A.; Gunther, Edward J.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Penn State Hershey Canc Inst, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Gunther, Edward J.] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Hematol Oncol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA","Gunther, EJ (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Jake Gittlen Labs Canc Res, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",ejg12@psu.edu,,,National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute; Mary Kay Foundation; Donald B. and Dorothy L.

In contrast, colon cancers that harbour the same BRAF(V600E) mutation are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors, due to feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)(3,4). Here we show that 6 out of 16 melanoma tumours analysed acquired EGFR expression after the development of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using a chromatin-regulator-focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, we find that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10(SOX10) in melanoma causes activation of TGF-beta signalling, thus leading to upregulation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB), which confer resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Expression of EGFR in melanoma or treatment with TGF-beta results in a slow-growth phenotype with cells displaying hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence. However, EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-beta becomes beneficial for proliferation in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. In a heterogeneous population of melanoma cells having varying levels of SOX10 suppression, cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are rapidly enriched in the presence of drug, but this is reversed when the drug treatment is discontinued. We find evidence for SOX10 loss and/or activation of TGF-beta signalling in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples. Our findings provide a rationale for why some BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma patients may regain sensitivity to these drugs after a 'drug holiday' and identify patients with EGFR-positive melanoma as a group that may benefit from re-treatment after a drug holiday.","[Sun, Chong; Wang, Liqin; Huang, Sidong; Heynen, Guus J.

Development of secondary lymphoid organs occurs during embryogenesis and is considered to be developmentally programmed(2,3). Secondary lymphoid organ formation depends on a subset of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) named lymphoid tissue inducer(LTi) cells(2-5). Here we show that mouse fetal ILC3s are controlled by cell-autonomous retinoic acid (RA) signalling in utero, which pre-sets the immune fitness in adulthood. We found that embryonic lymphoid organs contain ILC progenitors that differentiate locally into mature LTi cells. Local LTi cell differentiation was controlled by maternal retinoid intake and fetal RA signalling acting in a haematopoietic cell-autonomous manner. RA controlled LTi cell maturation upstream of the transcription factor ROR gamma t. Accordingly, enforced expression of Rorgt restored maturation of LTi cells with impaired RA signalling, whereas RA receptors directly regulated the Rorgt locus. Finally, we established that maternal levels of dietary retinoids control the size of secondary lymphoid organs and the efficiency of immune responses in the adult offspring. Our results reveal a molecular link between maternal nutrients and the formation of immune structures required for resistance to infection in the offspring.","[van de Pavert, Serge A.; Molenaar, Rosalie; Goverse, Gera; Konijn, Tanja; Schooneman, Dennis; O'Toole, Tom; Mizee, Mark R.; Habani, Yasmin; Mebius, Reina E.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Cell Biol & Immunol, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ferreira, Manuela; Domingues, Rita G.; Ribeiro, Helder; Moreira-Santos, Lara; Almeida, Francisca F.; Ibiza, Sales; Barbosa, Ines; Labao-Almeida, Carlos; Godinho-Silva, Cristina; Simas, J.

Here we show a strong coupling between mitochondrial function and ageing by in vivo visualization of the mitochondrial flash (mitoflash), a frequency-coded optical readout reflecting free-radical production and energy metabolism at the single-mitochondrion level(2,3). Mitoflash activity in Caenorhabditis elegans pharyngeal muscles peaked on adult day 3 during active reproduction and on day 9 when animals started to die off. A plethora of genetic mutations and environmental factors inversely modified the lifespan and the day-3 mitoflash frequency. Even within an isogenic population, the day-3 mitoflash frequency was negatively correlated with the lifespan of individual animals. Furthermore, enhanced activity of the glyoxylate cycle contributed to the decreased day-3 mitoflash frequency and the longevity of daf-2 mutant animals. These results demonstrate that the day-3 mitoflash frequency is a powerful predictor of C. elegans lifespan across genetic, environmental and stochastic factors. They also support the notion that the rate of ageing, although adjustable in later life, has been set to a considerable degree before reproduction ceases.","[Shen, En-Zhi; Song, Chun-Qing] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Shen, En-Zhi; Song, Chun-Qing; Zhang, Wen-Hong; Liu, Wen-Yuan; Zhang, Pan; Zhan, Cheng; Dong, Meng-Qiu] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yuan; Xu, Jiejia; Lin, Na; Wang, Xianhua; Cheng, Heping] Peking Univ, Inst Mol Med, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci,Beijing Key Lab Card, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Su, Pei-Fang] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Stat, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Shyr, Yu] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Ctr Quantitat Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Dong, MQ (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",chengp@pku.edu.cn; dongmengqiu@nibs.ac.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China (973) [2010CB835203, 2013CB531200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31130067, 31221002]; municipal government of Beijing; National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]","We thank B.

Here we show that induction of the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST; also known as neuron-restrictive silencer factor, NRSF) is a universal feature of normal ageing in human cortical and hippocampal neurons. REST is lost, however, in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing and expression analysis show that REST represses genes that promote cell death and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and induces the expression of stress response genes. Moreover, REST potently protects neurons from oxidative stress and amyloid beta-protein toxicity, and conditional deletion of REST in the mouse brain leads to age-related neurodegeneration. A functional orthologue of REST, Caenorhabditis elegans SPR-4, also protects against oxidative stress and amyloid beta-protein toxicity. During normal ageing, REST is induced in part by cell non-autonomous Wnt signalling. However, in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, REST is lost from the nucleus and appears in autophagosomes together with pathological misfolded proteins. Finally, REST levels during ageing are closely correlated with cognitive preservation and longevity. Thus, the activation state of REST may distinguish neuroprotection from neurodegeneration in the ageing brain.","[Lu, Tao; Aron, Liviu; Zullo, Joseph; Pan, Ying; Kim, Haeyoung; Yang, Tun-Hsiang; Kim, Hyun-Min; Drake, Derek; Colaiacovo, Monica P.; Yankner, Bruce A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Yiwen; Liu, X.

Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.","[Andersson, Robin; Hoof, Ilka; Bornholdt, Jette; Boyd, Mette; Chen, Yun; Zhao, Xiaobei; Valen, Eivind; Li, Kang; Lilje, Berit; Rapin, Nicolas; Bagger, Frederik Otzen; Jorgensen, Mette; Sandelin, Albin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Andersson, Robin; Hoof, Ilka; Bornholdt, Jette; Boyd, Mette; Chen, Yun; Zhao, Xiaobei; Valen, Eivind; Li, Kang; Lilje, Berit; Rapin, Nicolas; Bagger, Frederik Otzen; Jorgensen, Mette; Sandelin, Albin] Univ Copenhagen, Biotech Res & Innovat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gebhard, Claudia; Schmidl, Christian; Schwarzfischer, Lucia; Glatz, Dagmar; Raithel, Johanna; Rehli, Michael] Univ Hosp Regensburg, Dept Internal Med 3, D-93042 Regensburg, Germany; [Gebhard, Claudia; Rehli, Michael] Regensburg Ctr Intervent Immunol RCI, D-93042 Regensburg, Germany; [Miguel-Escalada, Irene; Mueller, Ferenc] Univ Birmingham, Sch Clin & Expt Med, Coll Med & Dent Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Zhao, Xiaobei] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Suzuki, Takahiro; Arner, Erik; Bertin, Nicolas; Rackham, Owen; Burroughs, A.

Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly 'housekeeping', whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis revealskey transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.","[Forrest, Alistair R.

The 1,000-kilometre-diameter dwarf planet Sedna was discovered ten years ago and was unique in that its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is 76 AU, far greater than that of any other Solar System body(1). Formation models indicate that Sedna could be a link between the Kuiper belt objects and the hypothesized outer Oort cloud at around 10,000 AU from the Sun(2-6). Here we report the presence of a second Sedna-like object, 2012 VP113, whose perihelion is 80 AU. The detection of 2012 VP113 confirms that Sedna is not an isolated object; instead, both bodies may be members of the inner Oort cloud, whose objects could outnumber all other dynamically stable populations in the Solar System.","[Trujillo, Chadwick A.] Gemini Observ, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Sheppard, Scott S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Trujillo, CA (reprint author), Gemini Observ, 670 North Aohoku Pl, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",trujillo@gemini.edu,,,National Science Foundation; NASA [NNX12AG26G]; Gemini Observatory,"We thank the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) team for obtaining observations during DECam commissioning, D.

As a result of this resolution, atoms can be made to scatter resonantly on demand, through the precise control of a magnetic field(1). For simple atoms, such as alkalis, scattering resonances are extremely well characterized(2). However, ultracold physics is now poised to enter a new regime, where much more complex species can be cooled and studied, including magnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules. For molecules, it has been speculated(3,4) that a dense set of resonances in ultracold collision cross-sections will probably exhibit essentially random fluctuations, much as the observed energy spectra of nuclear scattering do(5). According to the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, such fluctuations would imply chaotic dynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision(6-8). This would necessitate new ways of looking at the fundamental interactions in ultracold atomic and molecular systems, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states of ultracold matter. Here we describe the experimental demonstration that random spectra are indeed found at ultralow temperatures. In the experiment, an ultracold gas of erbium atoms is shown to exhibit many Fano-Feshbach resonances, of the order of three per gauss for bosons. Analysis of their statistics verifies that their distribution of nearest-neighbour spacings is what one would expect from random matrix theory(9). The density and statistics of these resonances are explained by fully quantum mechanical scattering calculations that locate their origin in the anisotropy of the atoms' potential energy surface. Our results therefore reveal chaotic behaviour in the native interaction between ultracold atoms.","[Frisch, Albert; Mark, Michael; Aikawa, Kiyotaka; Ferlaino, Francesca] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Bohn, John L.] Univ Colorado, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bohn, John L.] NIST, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Makrides, Constantinos; Petrov, Alexander; Kotochigova, Svetlana] Temple Univ, Dept Phys, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Petrov, Alexander] St Petersburg Nucl Phys Inst, Gatchina 188300, Russia; [Petrov, Alexander] St Petersburg State Univ, Div Quantum Mech, St Petersburg 198904, Russia","Ferlaino, F (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",francesca.ferlaino@uibk.ac.at,"Aikawa, Kiyotaka/D-4896-2016; Ferlaino, francesca/E-6726-2012; Petrov, Alexander/I-7865-2013","Petrov, Alexander/0000-0003-1342-3160",ARO MURI; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through a START grant [Y479-N20]; European Research Council [259435]; Lise-Meitner program of the FWF; AFOSR; NSF [PHY-1308573],"The Innsbruck group thanks R.

The rate at which the sinking carbon is converted into carbon dioxide by heterotrophic organisms at depth is important in controlling oceanic carbon storage(3). It remains uncertain, however, to what extent surface ocean carbon supply meets the demand of water-column biota; the discrepancy between known carbon sources and sinks is as much as two orders of magnitude(4-8). Here we present field measurements, respiration rate estimates and a steady-state model that allow us to balance carbon sources and sinks to within observational uncertainties at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain site in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. We find that prokaryotes are responsible for 70 to 92 per cent of the estimated remineralization in the twilight zone (depths of 50 to 1,000 metres) despite the fact that much of the organic carbon is exported in the form of large, fast-sinking particles accessible to larger zooplankton. We suggest that this occurs because zooplankton fragment and ingest half of the fast-sinking particles, of which more than 30 per cent may be released as suspended and slowly sinking matter, stimulating the deep-ocean microbial loop. The synergy between microbes and zooplankton in the twilight zone is important to our understanding of the processes controlling the oceanic carbon sink.","[Giering, Sarah L.

These fluctuations are probably a result of waves in the liquid core(4), although the precise nature of the waves is uncertain. Common suggestions include a type of magnetic wave, known as a torsional oscillation(5), but recent studies(6) favour periods that are too short to account for a 60-year fluctuation. Another possibility involves MAC waves(7), which arise from the interplay between magnetic, Archimedes and Coriolis forces. Waves with a suitable period can emerge when the top of the core is stably stratified. Here I show that MAC waves provide a good description of time-dependent zonal flow at the top of the core(8), as inferred from geomagnetic secular variation(9). The same wave motion can also account for unexplained fluctuations in the dipole field(10). Both of these independent predictions require a 140-kilometre-thick stratified layer with a buoyancy frequency comparable to the Earth's rotation rate. Such a stratified layer could have a thermal origin(11,12), implying a core heat flow of about 13 terawatts. Alternatively, the layer could result from chemical stratification(13,14). In either case, the existence of a stratified layer at the top of the core obscures the nature of flow deeper in the core, where the magnetic field is continually regenerated.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Buffett, B (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bbuffett@berkeley.edu,,,US National Science Foundation [EAR-1045277],A.

Recent calculations suggest that atmospheric CH4 emissions have been responsible for approximately 20% of Earth's warming since pre-industrial times(2). Understanding how CH4 emissions from ecosystems will respond to expected increases in global temperature is therefore fundamental to predicting whether the carbon cycle will mitigate or accelerate climate change. Methanogenesis is the terminal step in the remineralization of organic matter and is carried out by strictly anaerobic Archaea(3). Like most other forms of metabolism, methanogenesis is temperature-dependent(4,5). However, it is not yet known how this physiological response combines with other biotic processes (for example, methanotrophy(6), substrate supply(3,7), microbial community composition(8)) and abiotic processes (for example, water-table depth(9,10)) to determine the temperature dependence of ecosystem-level CH4 emissions. It is also not known whether CH4 emissions at the ecosystem level have a fundamentally different temperature dependence than other key fluxes in the carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration. Here we use meta-analyses to show that seasonal variations in CH4 emissions from a wide range of ecosystems exhibit an average temperature dependence similar to that of CH4 production derived from pure cultures of methanogens and anaerobic microbial communities. This average temperature dependence (0.96 electron volts (eV)), which corresponds to a 57-fold increase between 0 and 30 degrees C, is considerably higher than previously observed for respiration (approximately 0.65 eV)(11) and photosynthesis (approximately 0.3 eV)(12). As a result, we show that both the emission of CH4 and the ratio of CH4 to CO2 emissions increase markedly with seasonal increases in temperature. Our findings suggest that global warming may have a large impact on the relative contributions of CO2 and CH4 to total greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial wetlands and rice paddies.","[Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Allen, Andrew P.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Bastviken, David] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Conrad, Ralf] Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Gudasz, Cristian] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Gudasz, Cristian] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [St-Pierre, Annick; del Giorgio, Paul A.] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X8, Canada; [Nguyen Thanh-Duc] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Yvon-Durocher, G (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",g.yvon-durocher@exeter.ac.uk,"Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel/M-4600-2014","Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel/0000-0002-1749-3417; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152",,,,38,140,144,28,393,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Mar,2014,507,7493,,,,,488,491,,10.1038/nature13164,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AD6WN,WOS:000333402000038,24670769,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Nevertheless, changes in climate conditions are useful for predicting shifts in species distributions at global(4) and local scales(5). Here we use the velocity of climate change(6,7) to derive spatial trajectories for climatic niches from 1960 to 2009 (ref. 7) and from 2006 to 2100, and use the properties of these trajectories to infer changes in species distributions. Coastlines act as barriers and locally cooler areas act as attractors for trajectories, creating source and sink areas for local climatic conditions. Climate source areas indicate where locally novel conditions are not connected to areas where similar climates previously occurred, and are thereby inaccessible to climate migrants tracking isotherms: 16% of global surface area for 1960 to 2009, and 34% of ocean for the 'business as usual' climate scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5)(8) representing continued use of fossil fuels without mitigation. Climate sink areas are where climate conditions locally disappear, potentially blocking the movement of climate migrants. Sink areas comprise 1.0% of ocean area and 3.6% of land and are prevalent on coasts and high ground. Using this approach to infer shifts in species distributions gives global and regional maps of the expected direction and rate of shifts of climate migrants, and suggests areas of potential loss of species richness.","[Burrows, Michael T.; Molinos, Jorge Garcia] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Dept Ecol, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Schoeman, David S.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.; Poloczanska, Elvira S.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Ecosci Precinct, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, Ctr Applicat Nat Resource Math CARM, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hoffmann, Ary] Univ Melbourne, Dept Genet, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Buckley, Lauren B.; Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Moore, Pippa J.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DA, Dyfed, Wales; [Moore, Pippa J.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Perth, WA 6027, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Duarte, Carlos M.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Duarte, Carlos M.] IMEDEA UIB CSIC, Dept Global Change Res, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Esporles 07190, Spain; [Duarte, Carlos M.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Dept Marine Biol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Halpern, Benjamin S.; Kappel, Carrie V.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Halpern, Benjamin S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Kiessling, Wolfgang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, GeoZentrum Nordbayern, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Kiessling, Wolfgang] Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [O'Connor, Mary I.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [O'Connor, Mary I.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Pandolfi, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Parmesan, Camille] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Parmesan, Camille] Univ Plymouth, Marine Inst, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Sydeman, WilliamJ.] Farallon Inst Adv Ecosyst Res, Petaluma, CA 94952 USA; [Ferrier, Simon; Williams, Kristen J.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Burrows, MT (reprint author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Dept Ecol, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",mtb@sams.ac.uk,"Williams, Kristen/B-9941-2008; Pandolfi, John/A-3121-2009; Ferrier, Simon/C-1490-2009; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015; Poloczanska, Elvira/F-4366-2014; Brown, Christopher/G-4287-2011; Burrows, Michael/D-9844-2013; Richardson, Anthony/B-3649-2010; poloczanska, elvira/P-5356-2014; Kiessling, Wolfgang/E-2259-2015; Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; O'Connor, Mary/F-2275-2010; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013","Williams, Kristen/0000-0002-7324-5880; Pandolfi, John/0000-0003-3047-6694; Ferrier, Simon/0000-0001-7884-2388; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/0000-0001-7516-1835; Brown, Christopher/0000-0002-7271-4091; Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; Kiessling, Wolfgang/0000-0002-1088-2014; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Schoeman, David/0000-0003-1258-0885; poloczanska, elvira/0000-0001-8470-0925; Parmesan, Camille/0000-0002-1515-274X; Moore, Pippa/0000-0002-9889-2216","National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; NSF [EF-0553768]; University of California, Santa Barbara; State of California; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J024082/1]; Australian Research Council's Collaborative Research Network; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Research Council [DP0879365]; Future Fellowship [FT0991722]","This work was conducted as a part of the Towards Understanding Marine Biological Impacts of Climate Change Working Group supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a center funded by the NSF (grant no.

However, animals occupying this niche have not been identified from the early Palaeozoic era. Anomalocarids, a group of stem arthropods that were the largest nektonic animals of the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, are generally thought to have been apex predators(3-5). Here we describe new material from Tamisiocaris borealis(6), an anomalocarid from the Early Cambrian (Series 2) Sirius Passet Fauna of North Greenland, and propose that its frontal appendage is specialized for suspension feeding. The appendage bears long, slender and equally spaced ventral spines furnished with dense rows of long and fine auxiliary spines. This suggests that T. borealis was a microphagous suspension feeder, using its appendages for sweep-net capture of food items down to 0.5 mm, within the size range of mesozooplankton such as copepods. Our observations demonstrate that large, nektonic suspension feeders first evolved during the Cambrian explosion, as part of an adaptive radiation of anomalocarids. The presence of nektonic suspension feeders in the Early Cambrian, together with evidence for a diverse pelagic community containing phytoplankton(7,8) and mesozooplankton(7,9,10), indicate the existence of a complex pelagic ecosystem(11) supported by high primary productivity and nutrient flux(12,13). Cambrian pelagic ecosystems seem to have been more modern than previously believed.

These arise during development from just a few key differences in the growth patterns of the cranial primordia: notably, the nasal sacs and hypophysis originate from a single placode in cyclostomes but from separate placodes in gnathostomes, and infraoptic ectomesenchyme migrates forward either side of the single placode in cyclostomes but between the placodes in gnathostomes(3-8). Fossil stem gnathostomes preserve cranial anatomies rich in landmarks that provide proxies for developmental processes and allow the transition from jawless to jawed vertebrates to be broken down into evolutionary steps(7,9-12). Here we use propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography to image the cranial anatomy of the primitive placoderm (jawed stem gnathostome) Romundina(13), and show that itcombines jawed vertebrate architecture with cranial and cerebral proportions resembling those of cyclostomes and the galeaspid (jawless stem gnathostome) Shuyu(11). This combination seems to be primitive for jawed vertebrates, and suggests a decoupling between ectomesenchymal growth trajectory, ectomesenchymal proliferation, and cerebral shape change during the origin of gnathostomes.","[Dupret, Vincent; Sanchez, Sophie; Ahlberg, Per E.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Organismal Biol, Subdept Evolut & Dev, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sanchez, Sophie; Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Goujet, Daniel] UPMC, MNHN, CNRS, UMR 7207,CR2P, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Dupret, V (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Organismal Biol, Subdept Evolut & Dev, Norbyvagen 18A, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",vincent.dupret@ebc.uu.se; per.ahlberg@ebc.uu.se,,"Dupret, Vincent/0000-0002-6859-1041",European Research Council [233111]; Wallenberg Scholarship from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,"We thank the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility for granting us beam time at ID19 (proposal EC-203).

Although such movements lead to frequent and substantial displacements of the retinal image, these displacements go unnoticed. It is widely assumed that a primary mechanism underlying this apparent stability is an anticipatory shifting of visual receptive fields (RFs) from their presaccadic to their post-saccadic locations before movement onset(1). Evidence of this predictive 'remapping' of RFs has been particularly apparent within brain structures involved in gaze control(2-4). However, critically absent among that evidence are detailed measurements of visual RFs before movement onset. Here we show that during saccade preparation, rather than remap, RFs of neurons in a prefrontal gaze control area massively converge towards the saccadic target. We mapped the visual RFs of prefrontal neurons during stable fixation and immediately before the onset of eye movements, using multi-electrode recordings in monkeys. Following movements from an initial fixation point to a target, RFs remained stationary in retinocentric space. However, in the period immediately before movement onset, RFs shifted by as much as 18 degrees of visual angle, and converged towards the target location. This convergence resulted in a threefold increase in the proportion of RFs responding to stimuli near the target region. In addition, like in human observers(5,6), the population of prefrontal neurons grossly mislocalized presaccadic stimuli as being closer to the target. Our results show that RF shifts do not predict the retinal displacements due to saccades, but instead reflect the overriding perception of target space during eye movements.","[Zirnsak, Marc; Steinmetz, Nicholas A.; Noudoost, Behrad; Xu, Kitty Z.; Moore, Tirin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zirnsak, Marc; Moore, Tirin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Zirnsak, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mzirnsak@stanford.edu,,"Steinmetz, Nicholas/0000-0001-7029-2908",National Institutes of Health [EY014924]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant EY014924 and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (T.M.).

New therapeutic approaches to block inhibitory pathways of the immune system have renewed hopes for the utility of such therapies(2). Here we show that genetic deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b (casitas B-lineage lymphoma-b) or targeted inactivation of its E3 ligase activity licenses natural killer (NK) cells to spontaneously reject metastatic tumours. The TAM tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl and Mer (also known as Mertk) were identified as ubiquitylation substrates for Cbl-b. Treatment of wild-type NK cells with a newly developed small molecule TAM kinase inhibitor conferred therapeutic potential, efficiently enhancing anti-metastatic NK cell activity in vivo. Oral or intraperitoneal administration using this TAM inhibitor markedly reduced murine mammary cancer and melanoma metastases dependent on NK cells. We further report that the anticoagulant warfarin exerts anti-metastatic activity in mice via Cbl-b/TAM receptors in NK cells, providing a molecular explanation for a 50-year-old puzzle in cancer biology(3). This novel TAM/Cbl-b inhibitory pathway shows that it might be possible to develop a 'pill' that awakens the innate immune system to kill cancer metastases.","[Paolino, Magdalena; Pranjic, Blanka; Uribesalgo, Iris; Loeser, Stefanie; Ikeda, Fumiyo; Fededa, Juan Pablo; Cronin, Shane J.; Nitsch, Roberto; Penninger, Josef M.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Choidas, Axel; Schultz-Fademrecht, Carsten; Eickhoff, Jan; Menninger, Sascha; Unger, Anke; Klebl, Bert M.] Lead Discovery Ctr GmbH, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Wallner, Stephanie; Gruber, Thomas; Hinterleitner, Reinhard; Baier, Gottfried; Wolf, Dominik] Med Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Jamieson, Amanda M.] Brown Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Langdon, Wallace Y.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Pathol & Lab Med, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Torka, Robert; Ullrich, Axel] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Wolf, Dominik] Univ Hosp Bonn, D-53127 Bonn, Germany","Penninger, JM (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013","Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777; nitsch, roberto/0000-0001-8766-6267; Jamieson, Amanda/0000-0002-5781-9231; Ikeda, Fumiyo/0000-0003-0407-2768",European Research Council (ERC); Era of Hope/DoD Innovator Award; Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA); Austrian National Foundation; Austrian Academy of Sciences; GEN-AU (AustroMouse); EU ERC,"We thank T.

Although Bcl6 has been shown to be essential in T-FH-cell function, it may not regulate the initial migration of T cells(3) or the induction of the T-FH program, as exemplified by C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) upregulation(4). Here we show that expression of achaete-scute homologue 2 (Ascl2)-a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor(5)-is ;selectively upregulated in T-FH cells. Ectopic expression of Ascl2 upregulates CXCR5 but not Bcl6, and downregulates C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression in T cells in vitro, as well as accelerating T-cell migration to the follicles and T-FH-cell development in vivo in mice. Genome-wide analysis indicates that Ascl2 directly regulates T-FH-related genes whereas it inhibits expression of T-helper cell 1 (T(H)1) and T(H)17 signature genes. Acute deletion of Ascl2, as well as blockade of its function with the Id3 protein in CD4(+) T cells, results in impaired T-FH-cell development and germinal centre response. Conversely, mutation of Id3, known to cause antibody-mediated autoimmunity, greatly enhances T-FH-cell generation. Thus, Ascl2 directly initiates T-FH-cell development.","[Liu, Xindong; Chen, Xin; Wang, Aibo; Wang, Xiaohu; Qi, Hai; Dong, Chen] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xindong; Zhong, Bo; Wang, Aibo; Wang, Xiaohu; Nurieva, Roza I.; Dong, Chen] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77054 USA; [Chu, Fuliang; Neelapu, Sattva S.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Lymphoma & Myeloma, Houston, TX 77054 USA; [Yan, Xiaowei; Tian, Qiang] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Chen, Ping] NEI, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [van der Flier, Laurens G.; Clevers, Hans] Hubrecht Inst KNAW, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [van der Flier, Laurens G.; Clevers, Hans] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Nakatsukasa, Hiroko; Chen, Wanjun] Natl Inst Dent & Craniofacial Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wei, Lai] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Dong, C (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",xindongliu@hotmail.com; cdonglab@hotmail.com,"liu, xindong/F-8422-2014; dong, chen /B-3181-2009","dong, chen /0000-0002-0084-9130","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI106654]; NIDCR; NIH Lymphoma SPORE; MD Anderson Cancer Center; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology '973' program [2014CB542501, 2012CB910402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81361120397]","We thank J.

So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomasto provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways, as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in microRNA sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent in-frame activating FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses (including HPV16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic targets in 69% of the tumours, including 42% with targets in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and 45% with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far, indicating the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin abnormalities.","[Weinstein, John N.; Akbani, Rehan; Broom, Bradley M.; Wang, Wenyi; Verhaak, Roeland G.

Osteogenesis is indispensable for the homeostatic renewal of bone as well as regenerative fracture healing, but these processes frequently decline in ageing organisms, leading to loss of bone mass and increased fracture incidence. Evidence indicates that the growth of blood vessels in bone and osteogenesis are coupled, but relatively little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here we identify a new capillary subtype in the murine skeletal system with distinct morphological, molecular and functional properties. These vessels are found in specific locations, mediate growth of the bone vasculature, generate distinct metabolic and molecular microenvironments, maintain perivascular osteoprogenitors and couple angiogenesis to osteogenesis. The abundance of these vessels and associated osteoprogenitors was strongly reduced in bone from aged animals, and pharmacological reversal of this decline allowed the restoration of bone mass.","[Kusumbe, Anjali P.; Ramasamy, Saravana K.; Adams, Ralf H.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Adams, Ralf H.] Univ Munster, Fac Med, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Adams, RH (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",ralf.adams@mpi-muenster.mpg.de,,"Ramasamy, Saravana/0000-0003-2658-2945",Max Planck Society; University of Munster; DFG cluster of excellence 'Cells in Motion'; European Research Council [AdG 339409 AngioBone],"We thank A.

Here we show that the quinolone antibiotic trovafloxacin is a novel PANX1 inhibitor, by using a small-molecule screen. Although quinolones are widely used to treat bacterial infections, some quinolones have unexplained side effects, including deaths among children. PANX1 is a direct target of trovafloxacin at drug concentrations seen in human plasma, and its inhibition led to dysregulated fragmentation of apoptotic cells. Genetic loss of PANX1 phenocopied trovafloxacin effects, revealing a non-redundant role for pannexin channels in regulating cellulardisassemblyduring apoptosis. Increase in drug-resistant bacteria worldwide and the dearth of new antibiotics is a major human health challenge. Comparing different quinolone antibiotics suggests that certain structural features may contribute to PANX1 blockade. These data identify a novel linkage between an antibiotic, pannexin channels and cellular integrity, and suggest that re-engineering certain quinolones might help develop newer antibacterials.","[Poon, Ivan K.

Observational evidence of accretion events is provided by the coherent stellar streams crossing the outer haloes of massive galaxies, such as the Milky Way(1) or Andromeda(2). At similar mass scales, around 1011 solar masses in stars, further evidence of merging activity is also ample(3-5). Mergers of lower-mass galaxies are expected within the hierarchical process of galaxy formation(6), but have hitherto not been seen for galaxies with less than about 10(9) solar masses in stars(7,8). Here we report the kinematic detection of a stellar stream in one of the satellite galaxies of Andromeda, the dwarf spheroidal Andromeda II, which has a mass of only 10(7) solar masses in stars(9). The properties of the stream show that we are observing the remnant of a merger between two dwarf galaxies. This had a drastic influence on the dynamics of the remnant, which is now rotating around its projected major axis(10). The stellar stream in Andromeda II illustrates the scale-free character of the formation of galaxies, down to the lowest galactic mass scales.","[Amorisco, N.

Although planetary rotation is considered to be important for particle acceleration at Jupiter and Saturn(5-9), the electric field produced in the inner magnetosphere by Earth's rotation can change the velocity of trapped particles by only about 1-2 kilometres per second, so rotation has been thought inconsequential for radiation-belt electrons with velocities of about 100,000 kilometres per second. Here we report that the distributions of energetic electrons across the entire spatial extent of Earth's inner radiation belt are organized in regular, highly structured and unexpected 'zebra stripes', even when the solar-wind activity is low. Modelling reveals that the patterns are produced by Earth's rotation. Radiation-belt electrons are trapped in Earth's dipole-like magnetic field, where they undergo slow longitudinal drift motion around the planet because of the gradient and curvature of the magnetic field. Earth's rotation induces global diurnal variations of magnetic and electric fields that resonantly interact with electrons whose drift period is close to 24 hours, modifying electron fluxes over a broad energy range into regular patterns composed of multiple stripes extending over the entire span of the inner radiation belt.","[Ukhorskiy, A.

Today's digital microwave components (synthesizers and analogue-to-digital converters) suffer from limited bandwidth with high noise at increasing frequencies(5-7), so that fully digital radar systems can work up to only a few gigahertz, and noisy analogue up-and downconversions are necessary for higher frequencies. In contrast, photonics provide high precision and ultrawide bandwidth(8,9), allowing both the flexible generation of extremely stable radio-frequency signals with arbitrary waveforms up to millimetre waves(10-22), and the detection of such signals and their precise direct digitization without downconversion(23-26). Until now, the photonics-based generation and detection of radio-frequency signals have been studied separately and have not been tested in a radar system. Here we present the development and the field trial results of a fully photonics-based coherent radar demonstrator carried out within the project PHODIR27. The proposed architecture exploits a single pulsed laser for generating tunable radar signals and receiving their echoes, avoiding radio-frequency up-and downconversion and guaranteeing both the software-defined approach and high resolution. Its performance exceeds state-of-the-art electronics at carrier frequencies above two gigahertz, and the detection of non-cooperating aeroplanes confirms the effectiveness and expected precision of the system.","[Ghelfi, Paolo; Laghezza, Francesco; Scotti, Filippo; Scaffardi, Mirco; Malacarne, Antonio; Lazzeri, Emma; Bogoni, Antonella] Interuniv Natl Consortium Telecommun CNIT, Natl Lab Photon Networks, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Serafino, Giovanni; Pinna, Sergio; Onori, Daniel; Porzi, Claudio; Vercesi, Valeria] Scuola Super Sant Anna, TeCIP Inst, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Capria, Amerigo; Berizzi, Fabrizio] Interuniv Natl Consortium Telecommun CNIT, Natl Lab Radars & Surveillance Syst, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Berizzi, Fabrizio] Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, I-56122 Pisa, Italy","Bogoni, A (reprint author), Interuniv Natl Consortium Telecommun CNIT, Natl Lab Photon Networks, Via Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",antonella.bogoni@cnit.it,"Laghezza, Francesco/K-8906-2016; Lazzeri, Emma/M-1642-2014","Laghezza, Francesco/0000-0003-3301-3142; Lazzeri, Emma/0000-0003-0506-046X; Capria, Amerigo/0000-0003-4855-5323","ERC [239640, 324629]; EU NEXPRESSO programme through the project INSIDE; Selex ES S.p.A.","This work was supported by the ERC projects PHODIR (contract number 239640) and PREPARE (contract number 324629), and by the EU NEXPRESSO programme through the project INSIDE with Selex Sistemi Integrati S.p.A.

During the Cenozoic era, spanning approximately the past 66 million years, the concurrent increases in the marine isotopic ratios of strontium, osmium and lithium(2-4) suggest that extensive uplift of mountain ranges may have stimulated CO2 consumption by silicate weathering(5), but reconstructions of sea-floor spreading(6) do not indicate a corresponding increase in CO2 inputs from volcanic degassing. The resulting imbalance would have depleted the atmosphere of all CO2 within a few million years(7). As a result, reconciling Cenozoic isotopic records with the need for mass balance in the long-term carbon cycle has been a major and unresolved challenge in geochemistry and Earth history. Here we show that enhanced sulphide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution can provide a transient source of CO2 to Earth's atmosphere that is relevant over geological timescales. Like drawdown by means of silicate weathering, this source is probably enhanced by tectonic uplift, and so may have contributed to the relative stability of the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic. A variety of other hypotheses(8-10) have been put forward to explain the 'Cenozoic isotope-weathering paradox', and the evolution of the carbon cycle probably depended on multiple processes. However, an important role for sulphide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution is consistent with records of radiogenic isotopes2,3, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure(11,12) and the evolution of the Cenozoic sulphur cycle, and could be accounted for by geologically reasonable changes in the global dioxygen cycle, suggesting that this CO2 source should be considered a potentially important but as yet generally unrecognized component of the long-term carbon cycle.","Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Li, Gaojun] Nanjing Univ, Dept Earth Sci, MOE Key Lab Surficial Geochem, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Li, GJ (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Dept Earth Sci, MOE Key Lab Surficial Geochem, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",marktorr@usc.edu; joshwest@usc.edu; ligaojun@nju.edu.cn,"Li, Gaojun/A-7244-2013","Li, Gaojun/0000-0002-2463-0774","USC College Fellowship; C-DEBI Graduate Fellowship; NSF [NSF-EAR/GLD-1053504, EAR/GLTG-1227192]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41173105, 41102103, 41321062]","Support for this work comes from a USC College Fellowship and a C-DEBI Graduate Fellowship to M.
