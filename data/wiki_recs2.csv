1,1.0,"Ancient DNA makes it possible to observe natural selection directly by analysing samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we report a genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the largest ancient DNA data set yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians who lived between 6500 and 300 BC, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones, and who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe's first farmers. We also report a transect of the steppe region in Samara between 5600 and 300 BC, which allows us to identify admixture into the steppe from at least two external sources. We detect selection at loci associated with diet, pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height.","Mathieson, Iain; Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan;

2,2.0,"Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be a two-step process catalysed by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia or nitrite. No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities.","Daims, Holger; Lebedeva, Elena V.; Pjevac, Petra; Han, Ping; Herbold, Craig; Albertsen, Mads; Jehmlich, Nico; Palatinszky, Marton; Vierheilig, Julia; Bulaev, Alexandr; Kirkegaard, Rasmus H.; von Bergen, Martin; Rattei, Thomas; Bendinger, Bernd; Nielsen, Per H.; Wagner, Michael",,"Daims, H; Lebedeva, EV; Pjevac, P; Han, P; Herbold, C; Albertsen, M; Jehmlich, N; Palatinszky, M; Vierheilig, J; Bulaev, A; Kirkegaard, RH; von Bergen, M; Rattei, T; Bendinger, B; Nielsen, PH; Wagner, M",,,,,504,,"[Daims, Holger; Pjevac, Petra; Han, Ping; Herbold, Craig; Palatinszky, Marton; Vierheilig, Julia; Wagner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lebedeva, Elena V.; Bulaev, Alexandr] Russian Acad Sci, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Albertsen, Mads; Kirkegaard, Rasmus H.; Nielsen, Per H.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Ctr Microbial Communities, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Jehmlich, Nico; von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Prote, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Metabol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Rattei, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Div Computat Syst Biol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Bendinger, Bernd] Hamburg Univ Technol, DVGW Forsch Stelle TUHH, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16461,Article,1476-4687,wagner@microbial-ecology.net,+,"European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27319-B21, P25231-B21]; European Research Council Advanced Grant [NITRICARE 294343]; Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-4005-00369]; Innovation Fund Denmark (EcoDesign)","We thank T.

13,13.0,"Nitrification is a two-step process where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and/or archaea, and subsequently to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Already described by Winogradsky in 18901, this division of labour between the two functional groups is a generally accepted characteristic of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle(2). Complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in one organism (complete ammonia oxidation; comammox) is energetically feasible, and it was postulated that this process could occur under conditions selecting for species with lower growth rates but higher growth yields than canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms(3). Still, organisms catalysing this process have not yet been discovered. Here we report the enrichment and initial characterization of two Nitrospira species that encode all the enzymes necessary for ammonia oxidation via nitrite to nitrate in their genomes, and indeed completely oxidize ammonium to nitrate to conserve energy. Their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from currently identified AMOs, rendering recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from known ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms unlikely. We also found highly similar amoA sequences (encoding the AMO subunit A) in public sequence databases, which were apparently misclassified as methane monooxygenases. This recognition of a novel amoA sequence group will lead to an improved understanding of the environmental abundance and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Furthermore, the discovery of the long-sought-after comammox process will change our perception of the nitrogen cycle.","van Kessel, Maartje A. H.

17,17.0,"Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene activity, yet they bind only a fraction of their corresponding DNA sequence motifs in any given cell type(1). Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown(1,2). To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.","Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk",,"Domcke, S; Bardet, AF; Ginno, PA; Hartl, D; Burger, L; Schubeler, D",,,,,575,,"[Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Domcke, Silvia; Hartl, Dominik; Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Burger, Lukas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16462,Article,1476-4687,dirk@fmi.ch,+,Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE 'EpiGeneSys') [FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Union ('Blueprint' consortium) [FP7-282510]; European Research Council (EpiGePlas); Swiss initiative in Systems Biology (RTD Cell Plasticity); EMBO postdoctoral long-term fellowships; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We are grateful to S.

18,18.0,"A central question in protein evolution is the extent to which naturally occurring proteins sample the space of folded structures accessible to the polypeptide chain. Repeat proteins composed of multiple tandem copies of a modular structure unit(1) are widespread in nature and have critical roles in molecular recognition, signalling, and other essential biological processes(2). Naturally occurring repeat proteins have been re-engineered for molecular recognition and modular scaffolding applications(3-5). Here we use computational protein design to investigate the space of folded structures that can be generated by tandem repeating a simple helix-loop-helix-loop structural motif. Eighty-three designs with sequences unrelated to known repeat proteins were experimentally characterized. Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95 degrees C, and 43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models. Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 angstrom. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular engineering.","Brunette, T.

19,19.0,"Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of fibrous materials(1,2). The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks(3,4). The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures-which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks-is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners(5-9), to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis(10). Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed alpha-solenoid(11) repeat structures (alpha-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering(12-20), our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed alpha-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that-to our knowledge-is not yet present in the protein structure database(21).","Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip",,"Doyle, L; Hallinan, J; Bolduc, J; Parmeggiani, F; Baker, D; Stoddard, BL; Bradley, P",,,,,585,,"[Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Bradley, Philip] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98019 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16191,Article,1476-4687,pbradley@fredhutch.org,+,"National Institutes of Health [R21GM106117, R01GM49857]; Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoc Fellowship [PBZHP3-125470]; Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship [LT000070/2009-L]","The authors thank Scientific Computing at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for providing the computational infrastructure necessary for this project.

24,24.0,"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can amplify the local magnetic field over very short timescales(1,2). Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action(3-6) have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion(7-10) of a rotating massive star(11,12). Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae(13,14), which make up all supernovae that are connected to long gamma-ray bursts(15,16). The magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three dimensions(17-19), and with global two-dimensional simulations(20), but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae(13,21,22) and long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of magnetars(23,24). Moreover, our findings suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae(25,26).","Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.; Schnetter, Erik; Haas, Roland",,"Mosta, P; Ott, CD; Radice, D; Roberts, LF; Schnetter, E; Haas, R",,,,,376,,"[Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.] CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Moesta, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schnetter, Erik] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Univ Guelph, Dept Phys, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Haas, Roland] Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15755,Article,1476-4687,pmoesta@berkeley.edu,+,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST-1212170, PHY-1151197, OCI-0905046]; NASA [PF5-160140, PF3-140114]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Sherman Fairchild Foundation","We thank S.

27,27.0,"Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3). Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for the rational design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat transfer.","Kim, Kyeongtae; Song, Bai; Fernandez-Hurtado, Victor; Lee, Woochul; Jeong, Wonho; Cui, Longji; Thompson, Dakotah; Feist, Johannes; Reid, M.

35,35.0,"DNA repair by homologous recombination(1) is highly suppressed in G1 cells(2,3) to ensure that mitotic recombination occurs solely between sister chromatids(4). Although many homologous recombination factors are cell-cycle regulated, the identity of the events that are both necessary and sufficient to suppress recombination in G1 cells is unknown. Here we report that the cell cycle controls the interaction of BRCA1 with PALB2-BRCA2 to constrain BRCA2 function to the S/G2 phases in human cells. We found that the BRCA1-interaction site on PALB2 is targeted by an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of KEAP1, a PALB2-interacting protein(5), in complex with cullin-3 (CUL3)-RBX1 (ref.6). PALB2 ubiquitylation suppresses its interaction with BRCA1 and is counteracted by the deubiquitylase USP11, which is itself under cell cycle control. Restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction combined with the activation of DNA-end resection is sufficient to induce homologous recombination in G1, as measured by RAD51 recruitment, unscheduled DNA synthesis and a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-targeting assay. We conclude that the mechanism prohibiting homologous recombination in G1 minimally consists of the suppression of DNA-end resection coupled with a multi-step block of the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA damage sites that involves the inhibition of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex assembly. We speculate that the ability to induce homologous recombination in G1 cells with defined factors could spur the development of gene-targeting applications in non-dividing cells.","Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Enchev, Radoslav I.; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham; Xia, Bing; Peter, Matthias; Durocher, Daniel",,"Orthwein, A; Noordermeer, SM; Wilson, MD; Landry, S; Enchev, RI; Sherker, A; Munro, M; Pinder, J; Salsman, J; Dellaire, G; Xia, B; Peter, M; Durocher, D",,,,,422,,"[Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Durocher, Daniel] Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Enchev, Radoslav I.; Peter, Matthias] ETH, Inst Biochem, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sherker, Alana; Durocher, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pathol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Canc Inst New Jersey, Dept Radiat Oncol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16142,Article,1476-4687,durocher@lunenfeld.ca,+,"Dutch Cancer Society (KWF); Human Frontier Science Program fellowship; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship; Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute (BHCRI); Harvey Graham Cancer Research Fund as part of the Terry Fox Foundation Strategic Health Research Training Program in Cancer Research at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Krembil Foundation; CIHR [FDN143343, MOP84260]","We are grateful to R.

47,47.0,"In recent years, several associations between common chronic human disorders and altered gut microbiome composition and function have been reported(1,2). In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis(3,4). Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa(3,4). These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.","Forslund, Kristoffer; Hildebrand, Falk; Nielsen, Trine; Falony, Gwen; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Prifti, Edi; Vieira-Silva, Sara; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Pedersen, Helle Krogh; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Kristiansen, Karsten; Voigt, Anita Yvonne; Vestergaard, Henrik; Hercog, Rajna; Costea, Paul Igor; Kultima, Jens Roat; Li, Junhua; Jorgensen, Torben; Levenez, Florence; Dore, Joel; Nielsen, H.

49,49.0,"Skeletal growth relies on both biosynthetic and catabolic processes(1,2). While the role of the former is clearly established, how the latter contributes to growth-promoting pathways is less understood. Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that plays a fundamental part in tissue homeostasis(3). We investigated the role of autophagy during bone growth, which is mediated by chondrocyte rate of proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in growth plates(4). Here we show that autophagy is induced in growth-plate chondrocytes during post-natal development and regulates the secretion of type II collagen (Col2), the major component of cartilage ECM. Mice lacking the autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) in chondrocytes experience endoplasmic reticulum storage of type II procollagen (PC2) and defective formation of the Col2 fibrillary network in the ECM. Surprisingly, post-natal induction of chondrocyte autophagy is mediated by the growth factor FGF18 through FGFR4 and JNK-dependent activation of the autophagy initiation complex VPS34-beclin-1. Autophagy is completely suppressed in growth plates from Fgf18(-/-) embryos, while Fgf18(+/-) heterozygous and Fgfr4(-/-) mice fail to induce autophagy during post-natal development and show decreased Col2 levels in the growth plate. Strikingly, the Fgf18(+/-) and Fgfr4(-/-) phenotypes can be rescued in vivo by pharmacological activation of autophagy, pointing to autophagy as a novel effector of FGF signalling in bone. These data demonstrate that autophagy is a developmentally regulated process necessary for bone growth, and identify FGF signalling as a crucial regulator of autophagy in chondrocytes.","Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Rossi, Antonio; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine",,"Cinque, L; Forrester, A; Bartolomeo, R; Svelto, M; Venditti, R; Montefusco, S; Polishchuk, E; Nusco, E; Rossi, A; Medina, DL; Polishchuk, R; De Matteis, MA; Settembre, C",,,,,272,,"[Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine] Telethon Inst Genet & Med TIGEM, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Forrester, Alison; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Med & Translat Sci, Med Genet Unit, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Rossi, Antonio] Univ Pavia, Biochem Unit, Dept Mol Med, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16063,Article,1476-4687,settembre@tigem.it,+,Italian Telethon Foundation [TCP12008]; Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-618805]; STAR/Banco di Napoli; Italian Ministry of Research [FIRB RBFR13LH4X],"We thank A.

51,51.0,"During asymmetric division, fate determinants at the cell cortex segregate unequally into the two daughter cells. It has recently been shown that Sara (Smad anchor for receptor activation) signalling endosomes in the cytoplasm also segregate asymmetrically during asymmetric division(1,2). Biased dispatch of Sara endosomes mediates asymmetric Notch/Delta signalling during the asymmetric division of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila(1). In flies, this has been generalized to stem cells in the gut(3) and the central nervous system(1), and, in zebrafish, to neural precursors of the spinal cord(4). However, the mechanism of asymmetric endosome segregation is not understood. Here we show that the plus-end kinesin motor Klp98A targets Sara endosomes to the central spindle, where they move bidirectionally on an antiparallel array of microtubules. The microtubule depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A and its antagonist Patronin generate central spindle asymmetry. This asymmetric spindle, in turn, polarizes endosome motility, ultimately causing asymmetric endosome dispatch into one daughter cell. We demonstrate this mechanism by inverting the polarity of the central spindle by polar targeting of Patronin using nanobodies (single-domain antibodies). This spindle inversion targets the endosomes to the wrong cell. Our data uncover the molecular and physical mechanism by which organelles localized away from the cellular cortex can be dispatched asymmetrically during asymmetric division.","Derivery, Emmanuel; Seum, Carole; Daeden, Alicia; Loubery, Sylvain; Holtzer, Laurent; Juelicher, Frank; Gonzalez-Gaitan, Marcos",,"Derivery, E; Seum, C; Daeden, A; Loubery, S; Holtzer, L; Julicher, F; Gonzalez-Gaitan, M",,,,,280,,"[Derivery, Emmanuel; Seum, Carole; Daeden, Alicia; Loubery, Sylvain; Holtzer, Laurent; Gonzalez-Gaitan, Marcos] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Juelicher, Frank] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16443,Article,1476-4687,emmanuel.derivery@unige.ch; julicher@pks.mpg.de; marcos.gonzalez@unige.ch,+,Human Frontier Science Program; Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship; Departement de l'Instruction Publique of the Canton of Geneva; SNF; SystemsX epiPhysX program; NCCR Chemical Biology program; ERC; Polish-Swiss research programs,"We thank A.

56,56.0,"Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is now being studied in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. However, measuring entanglement remains a challenge. This is especially so in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Making use of our single-site-resolved control of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare two identical copies of a many-body state and interfere them. This enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Renyi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems.","Islam, Rajibul; Ma, Ruichao; Preiss, Philipp M.; Tai, M.

60,60.0,"Overflow metabolism refers to the seemingly wasteful strategy in which cells use fermentation instead of the more efficient respiration to generate energy, despite the availability of oxygen. Known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.","Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Williamson, James R.; Hwa, Terence",,"Basan, M; Hui, S; Okano, H; Zhang, ZG; Shen, Y; Williamson, JR; Hwa, T",,,,,99,,"[Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Basan, Markus] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Williamson, James R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hwa, Terence] ETH, Inst Theoret Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15765,Article,1476-4687,hwa@ucsd.edu,+,"NIH [R01-GM109069]; Simons Foundation [330378]; M.

62,62.0,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Gu, Wei-Min; Liu, Qing-Zhong; Di Stefano, Rosanne; Guo, Jin-Cheng; Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro; Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri",,"Liu, JF; Bai, Y; Wang, S; Justham, S; Lu, YJ; Gu, WM; Liu, QZ; Di Stefano, R; Guo, JC; Cabrera-Lavers, A; Alvarez, P; Cao, Y; Kulkarni, S",,,,,108,,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15751,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

70,70.0,"DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian cells(1-3). Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells(4,5). Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G> C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.","Jin, Wenfei; Tang, Qingsong; Wan, Mimi; Cui, Kairong; Zhang, Yi; Ren, Gang; Ni, Bing; Sklar, Jeffrey; Przytycka, Teresa M.; Childs, Richard; Levens, David; Zhao, Keji",,"Jin, WF; Tang, QS; Wan, MM; Cui, KR; Zhang, Y; Ren, G; Ni, B; Sklar, J; Przytycka, TM; Childs, R; Levens, D; Zhao, KJ",,,,,142,,"[Jin, Wenfei; Tang, Qingsong; Cui, Kairong; Zhang, Yi; Ren, Gang; Zhao, Keji] NHLBI, Syst Biol Ctr, Div Intramural Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wan, Mimi; Sklar, Jeffrey] Yale Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhang, Yi; Ni, Bing] Peoples Liberat Army, Mil Med Univ 3, Inst Immunol, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China; [Ren, Gang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Przytycka, Teresa M.] Natl Lib Med, Computat Biol Branch, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Childs, Richard] NHLBI, Hematol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Levens, David] NCI, Pathol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15740,Article,1476-4687,zhaok@nhlbi.nih.gov,+,"Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Intramural Research Program of National Library of Medicine; Center for Cancer Research of the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health","We thank J.

71,71.0,"One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several TFs(1), indicating that TFs function synergistically and combinatorially(2,3). However, while TF binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of TFs and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which TFs participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different TFs form functionally distinct groups, or if certain TFs might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of TFs and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusions of 812 Drosophila TFs and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of TFs that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar TFs can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging TF motifs, and TF-cofactor pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of TFs and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.","Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander",,"Stampfel, G; Kazmar, T; Frank, O; Wienerroither, S; Reiter, F; Stark, A",,,,,147,,"[Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15545,Article,1476-4687,stark@starklab.org,+,European Research Council (ERC) [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"We are grateful to K.

72,72.0,"Tuberculosis is a major source of global mortality caused by infection, partly because of a tremendous ongoing burden of undiagnosed disease. Improved diagnostic technology may play an increasingly crucial part in global efforts to end tuberculosis, but the ability of diagnostic tests to curb tuberculosis transmission is dependent on multiple factors, including the time taken by a patient to seek health care, the patient's symptoms, and the patterns of transmission before diagnosis. Novel diagnostic assays for tuberculosis have conventionally been evaluated on the basis of characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, using assumptions that probably overestimate the impact of diagnostic tests on transmission. We argue for a shift in focus to the evaluation of such tests' incremental value, defining outcomes that reflect each test's purpose (for example, transmissions averted) and comparing systems with the test against those without, in terms of those outcomes. Incremental value can also be measured in units of outcome per incremental unit of resource (for example, money or human capacity). Using a novel, simplified model of tuberculosis transmission that addresses some of the limitations of earlier tuberculosis diagnostic models, we demonstrate that the incremental value of any novel test depends not just on its accuracy, but also on elements such as patient behaviour, tuberculosis natural history and health systems. By integrating these factors into a single unified framework, we advance an approach to the evaluation of new diagnostic tests for tuberculosis that considers the incremental value at the population level and demonstrates how additional data could inform more-effective implementation of tuberculosis diagnostic tests under various conditions.","Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Dowdy, David",,"Arinaminpathy, N; Dowdy, D",,,,,S60,,"[Arinaminpathy, Nimalan] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, MRC Ctr Outbreak Anal & Modelling, London W2 1PG, England; [Dowdy, David] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16045,Article,1476-4687,ddowdy1@jhmi.edu,S67,B.

87,87.0,"Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade(1). In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents-inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.","Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Pezet, Sophie; Desailly, Yann; Lenkei, Zsolt; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael",,"Rrico, CE; Pierre, J; Pezet, S; Desailly, Y; Lenkei, Z; Couture, O; Tanter, M",,,,,499,,"[Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] INSERM, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] CNRS, UMR 8249, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Brain Plast Unit, F-75005 Paris, France",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16066,Article,1476-4687,mickael.tanter@espci.fr,+,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI; Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes; LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence) within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"" [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]","This work was supported principally by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI.

92,92.0,"For more than a century, fungal pathogens and symbionts have been known to orient hyphal growth towards chemical stimuli from the host plant(1,2). However, the nature of the plant signals as well as the mechanisms underlying the chemotropic response have remained elusive(3). Here we show that directed growth of the soil-inhabiting plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum towards the roots of the host tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is triggered by the catalytic activity of secreted class III peroxidases, a family of haem-containing enzymes present in all land plants(4). The chemotropic response requires conserved elements of the fungal cell integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade(5) and the seven-pass transmembrane protein Ste2, a functional homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sex pheromone a receptor(6). We further show that directed hyphal growth of F. oxysporum towards nutrient sources such as sugars and amino acids is governed by a functionally distinct MAPK cascade. These results reveal a potentially conserved chemotropic mechanism in root-colonizing fungi, and suggest a new function for the fungal pheromone-sensing machinery in locating plant hosts in a complex environment such as the soil.","Turra, David; El Ghalid, Mennat; Rossi, Federico; Di Pietro, Antonio",,"Turra, D; El Ghalid, M; Rossi, F; Di Pietro, A",,,,,521,,"[Turra, David; El Ghalid, Mennat; Rossi, Federico; Di Pietro, Antonio] Univ Cordoba, Dept Genet, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15516,Article,1476-4687,ge2dipia@uco.es,+,"Spanish Ministerio de Innovacion y Competitividad (MINECO) [BIO2010-15505, BIO2013-47870-R]; MINECO/ERA-NET PathoGenoMics [BIO2008-04479]; Marie Curie ITN ARIADNE from the European Commission [FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-237936]; ERASMUS student exchange program","The authors are grateful to E.

99,99.0,"Ever since Stephen Paget's 1889 hypothesis, metastatic organotropism has remained one of cancer's greatest mysteries. Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse and human lung-, liver-and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins alpha(6)beta(4) and alpha(6)beta(1) were associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin alpha(v)beta(5) was linked to liver metastasis. Targeting the integrins alpha(6)beta(4) and alpha(v)beta(5) decreased exosome uptake, as well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.","Hoshino, Ayuko; Costa-Silva, Bruno; Shen, Tang-Long; Rodrigues, Goncalo; Hashimoto, Ayako;

103,103.0,"The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens(1-4) or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures(5-7). These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone(8-10), allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied.","Liebi, Marianne; Georgiadis, Marios; Menzel, Andreas; Schneider, Philipp; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel",,"Liebi, M; Georgiadis, M; Menzel, A; Schneider, P; Kohlbrecher, J; Bunk, O; Guizar-Sicairos, M",,,,,349,,"[Liebi, Marianne; Menzel, Andreas; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Georgiadis, Marios] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] Univ Southampton, Bioengn Sci Res Grp, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16056,Article,1476-4687,marianne.liebi@psi.ch; manuel.guizar-sicairos@psi.ch,+,ETH Research Grant [ETH-39 11-1],"We thank M.

104,104.0,"When used in combination with raster scanning, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique of the nanoscale(1), for example of bone, teeth and brain matter(2-5). Although two-dimensional projection imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomography, poses substantial challenges, which have yet to be overcome. Previous work(6-11) using SAXS computed tomography was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction. Here we present a solution to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed tomography, which preserves oriented scattering information. By introducing virtual tomography axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of the three-dimensional object in real space. The presented method could be of interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features with length scales ranging from a few nanometres to a few millimetres-for example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as fuel-cell or battery components.","Schaff, Florian; Bech, Martin; Zaslansky, Paul; Jud, Christoph; Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel; Pfeiffer, Franz",,"Schaff, F; Bech, M; Zaslansky, P; Jud, C; Liebi, M; Guizar-Sicairos, M; Pfeiffer, F",,,,,353,,"[Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biomed Phys, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Med Tech, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bech, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Med Radiat Phys, Clin Sci, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Zaslansky, Paul] Charite, Julius Wolff Inst, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Inst Diagnost & Interventionelle Radiol, D-81675 Munich, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16060,Article,1476-4687,florian.schaff@tum.de; martin.bech@med.lu.se; franz.pfeiffer@tum.de,+,DFG Cluster of Excellence Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics (MAP); DFG Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz program; DFG (German Research Foundation) [SPP1420]; TUM Graduate School; TUM Institute for Advanced Studies (TUM-IAS),"The SAXS experiments were performed at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland.

107,107.0,"Classical sexual selection theory(1-4) provides a well-supported conceptual framework for understanding the evolution and signalling function of male ornaments. It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","Dale, James; Dey, Cody J.; Delhey, Kaspar; Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai",,"Dale, J; Dey, CJ; Delhey, K; Kempenaers, B; Valcu, M",,,,,367,,"[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15509,Article,1476-4687,j.dale@massey.ac.nz,+,Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate Scholarship; Australian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck Society,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

108,108.0,"The neural crest is an evolutionary novelty that fostered the emergence of vertebrate anatomical innovations such as the cranium and jaws(1). During embryonic development, multipotent neural crest cells are specified at the lateral borders of the neural plate before delaminating, migrating and differentiating into various cell types. In invertebrate chordates (cephalochordates and tunicates), neural plate border cells express conserved factors such as Msx, Snail and Pax3/7 and generate melanin-containing pigment cells(2-4), a derivative of the neural crest in vertebrates. However, invertebrate neural plate border cells have not been shown to generate homologues of other neural crest derivatives. Thus, proposed models of neural crest evolution postulate vertebrate-specific elaborations on an ancestral neural plate border program, through acquisition of migratory capabilities and the potential to generate several cell types(5-7). Here we show that a particular neuronal cell type in the tadpole larva of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the bipolar tail neuron, shares a set of features with neural-crest-derived spinal ganglia neurons in vertebrates. Bipolar tail neuron precursors derive from caudal neural plate border cells, delaminate and migrate along the paraxial mesoderm on either side of the neural tube, eventually differentiating into afferent neurons that form synaptic contacts with both epidermal sensory cells and motor neurons. We propose that the neural plate borders of the chordate ancestor already produced migratory peripheral neurons and pigment cells, and that the neural crest evolved through the acquisition of a multipotent progenitor regulatory state upstream of multiple, pre-existing neural plate border cell differentiation programs.","Stolfi, Alberto; Ryan, Kerrianne; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.; Christiaen, Lionel",,"Stolfi, A; Ryan, K; Meinertzhagen, IA; Christiaen, L",,,,,371,,"[Stolfi, Alberto; Christiaen, Lionel] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Ryan, Kerrianne; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Life Sci Ctr, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15758,Article,1476-4687,lc121@nyu.edu,+,National Science Foundation [NSF-1161835]; National Institutes of Health [GM096032]; NSERC (Ottawa) [DIS0000065],"The authors would like to thank F.

111,111.0,"Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs), proteins that recognize short DNA sequence motifs(1-3). Such sequences are very common in the human genome, and an important determinant of the specificity of gene expression is the cooperative binding of multiple TFs to closely located motifs(4-6). However, interactions between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized. To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF-TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs. Together, our results indicate that the DNA molecule commonly plays an active role in cooperative interactions that define the gene regulatory lexicon.","Jolma, Arttu; Yin, Yimeng; Nitta, Kazuhiro R.; Dave, Kashyap; Popov, Alexander; Taipale, Minna; Enge, Martin; Kivioja, Teemu; Morgunova, Ekaterina; Taipale, Jussi",,"Jolma, A; Yin, YM; Nitta, KR; Dave, K; Popov, A; Taipale, M; Enge, M; Kivioja, T; Morgunova, E; Taipale, J",,,,,384,,"[Jolma, Arttu; Yin, Yimeng; Nitta, Kazuhiro R.; Dave, Kashyap; Taipale, Minna; Enge, Martin; Morgunova, Ekaterina; Taipale, Jussi] Karolinska Inst, Dept Biosci & Nutr, SE-14183 Stockholm, Sweden; [Popov, Alexander] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Kivioja, Teemu; Taipale, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Genome Scale Biol Program, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15518,Article,1476-4687,jussi.taipale@ki.se,+,Finnish Academy CoE in Cancer Genetics; Center for Innovative Medicine; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Goran Gustafsson Foundation; Vetenskapsradet,"We thank J.

112,112.0,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger non-proteolytic ubiquitylation of adjacent chromatin areas to generate binding sites for DNA repair factors. This depends on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (refs 1-6), and UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that specifically generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains(7). Whereas RNF168 is known to catalyse ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, leading to the recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 (refs 8-10), the critical substrates of RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitylation remain elusive. Here we elucidate how RNF8 and UBC13 promote recruitment of RNF168 and downstream factors to DSB sites in human cells. We establish that UBC13-dependent K63-linked ubiquitylation at DSB sites is predominantly mediated by RNF8 but not RNF168, and that H1-type linker histones, but not core histones, represent major chromatin-associated targets of this modification. The RNF168 module (UDM1) recognizing RNF8-generated ubiquitylations(11) is a high-affinity reader of K63-ubiquitylated H1, mechanistically explaining the essential roles of RNF8 and UBC13 in recruiting RNF168 to DSBs. Consistently, reduced expression or chromatin association of linker histones impair accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and repair factors at DSB-flanking chromatin. These results identify histone H1 as a key target of RNF8-UBC13 in DSB signalling and expand the concept of the histone code(12,13) by showing that posttranslational modifications of linker histones can serve as important marks for recognition by factors involved in genome stability maintenance, and possibly beyond.","Thorslund, Tina; Ripplinger, Anita; Hoffmann, Saskia; Wild, Thomas; Uckelmann, Michael; Villumsen, Bine; Narita, Takeo; Sixma, Titia K.; Choudhary, Chunaram; Bekker-Jensen, Simon; Mailand, Niels",,"Thorslund, T; Ripplinger, A; Hoffmann, S; Wild, T; Uckelmann, M; Villumsen, B; Narita, T; Sixma, TK; Choudhary, C; Bekker-Jensen, S; Mailand, N",,,,,389,,"[Thorslund, Tina; Ripplinger, Anita; Hoffmann, Saskia; Villumsen, Bine; Bekker-Jensen, Simon; Mailand, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Ubiquitin Signaling Grp,Prot Signaling Program, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wild, Thomas; Narita, Takeo; Choudhary, Chunaram] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Prot Res, Prote Program, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Uckelmann, Michael; Sixma, Titia K.] Netherlands Canc Inst, Canc Genom Ctr, Div Biochem, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15401,Article,1476-4687,niels.mailand@cpr.ku.dk,+,"Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF14CC0001, NNF12OC0002114]; European Research Council; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Chemische Wetenschappen (NWO-CW); Danish Cancer Society; Danish Council for Independent Research","We thank D.

114,114.0,"nxiety-related conditions are among the most difficult neuropsychiatric diseases to treat pharmacologically, but respond to cognitive therapies. There has therefore been interest in identifying relevant top-down pathways from cognitive control regions in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Identification of such pathways could contribute to our understanding of the cognitive regulation of affect, and provide pathways for intervention. Previous studies have suggested that dorsal and ventral mPFC subregions exert opposing effects on fear, as do subregions of other structures. However, precise causal targets for top-down connections among these diverse possibilities have not been established. Here we show that the basomedial amygdala (BMA) represents the major target of ventral mPFC in amygdala in mice. Moreover, BMA neurons differentiate safe and aversive environments, and BMA activation decreases fear-related freezing and high-anxiety states. Lastly, we show that the ventral mPFC-BMA projection implements top-down control of anxiety state and learned freezing, both at baseline and in stress-induced anxiety, defining a broadly relevant new top-down behavioural regulation pathway.","Adhikari, Avishek; Lerner, Talia N.; Finkelstein, Joel; Pak, Sally; Jennings, Joshua H.; Davidson, Thomas J.; Ferenczi, Emily; Gunaydin, Lisa A.; Irzabekov, Julie J.

125,125.0,"Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies(1,2), but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries(3,4). In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature(5), while poor countries respond only linearly(5,6). Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human-natural systems(7,8) and to anticipating the global impact of climate change(9,10). Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13 degrees C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change(11,12), with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.","Burke, Marshall; Hsiang, Solomon M.; Miguel, Edward",,"Burke, M; Hsiang, SM; Miguel, E",,,,,235,,"[Burke, Marshall] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Burke, Marshall] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hsiang, Solomon M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hsiang, Solomon M.; Miguel, Edward] Univ Calif Berkeley, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miguel, Edward] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15725,Article,1476-4687,mburke@stanford.edu,+,,,CV6RC,,Y,,N,CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODELS; US,7577.0,NATURE,Nature,English,,27.0,No,"Burke, Marshall/0000-0003-4288-5858","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Nov,16.0,LONDON,26503051.0,,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Burke, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,0028-0836,NATURE,,,65.0,Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production,25.0,94.0,WOS:000364396700045,527,Multidisciplinary Sciences,68,edward,miguel,18371,1015,male,1,okJiGugAAAAJ,33144061,1
128,128.0,"Epigenetic silencing including histone modifications and DNA methylation is an important tumorigenic mechanism(1). However, its role in cancer immunopathology and immunotherapy is poorly understood. Using human ovarian cancers as our model, here we show that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation repress the tumour production of T helper 1 (T(H)1)-type chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and subsequently determine effector T-cell trafficking to the tumour microenvironment. Treatment with epigenetic modulators removes the repression and increases effector T-cell tumour infiltration, slows down tumour progression, and improves the therapeutic efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-H1) checkpoint blockade(2-4) and adoptive T-cell transfusion(5) in tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, tumour EZH2 and DNMT1 are negatively associated with tumour-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and patient outcome. Thus, epigenetic silencing of T(H)1-type chemokines is a novel immune-evasion mechanism of tumours. Selective epigenetic reprogramming alters the T-cell landscape(6) in cancer and may enhance the clinical efficacy of cancer therapy.","Peng, Dongjun; Kryczek, Ilona; Nagarsheth, Nisha; Zhao, Lili; Wei, Shuang; Wang, Weimin; Sun, Yuqing; Zhao, Ende; Vatan, Linda; Szeliga, Wojciech; Kotarski, Jan; Tarkowski, Rafal; Dou, Yali; Cho, Kathleen; Hensley-Alford, Sharon; Munkarah, Adnan; Liu, Rebecca; Zou, Weiping",,"Peng, DJ; Kryczek, I; Nagarsheth, N; Zhao, LL; Wei, S; Wang, WM; Sun, YQ; Zhao, ED; Vatan, L; Szeliga, W; Kotarski, J; Tarkowski, R; Dou, YL; Cho, K; Hensley-Alford, S; Munkarah, A; Liu, R; Zou, WP",,,,,249,,"[Peng, Dongjun; Kryczek, Ilona; Nagarsheth, Nisha; Wei, Shuang; Wang, Weimin; Zhao, Ende; Vatan, Linda; Szeliga, Wojciech; Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kryczek, Ilona; Nagarsheth, Nisha; Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Grad Program Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zhao, Lili] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sun, Yuqing; Dou, Yali; Cho, Kathleen] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kotarski, Jan; Tarkowski, Rafal] Med Univ Lublin, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Gynecol 1, PL-20081 Lublin, Poland; [Cho, Kathleen; Liu, Rebecca; Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hensley-Alford, Sharon; Munkarah, Adnan] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Dept Womens Hlth Serv, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Liu, Rebecca] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zou, Weiping] Univ Michigan, Grad Program Tumor Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15520,Article,1476-4687,wzou@med.umich.edu,+,"NIH [CA190176, CA123088, CA099985, CA156685, CA193136, CA152470, CA171306, 5P30CA46592]; Rivkin Ovarian Cancer Center; Ovarian Cancer Research Fund","This work is supported (in part) by the NIH grants (CA190176; CA123088; CA099985; CA156685; CA193136; CA152470; CA171306; 5P30CA46592), the Rivkin Ovarian Cancer Center, and the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.

132,132.0,"Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many transcription factors activate in dynamic, and often stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.","Lin, Yihan; Sohn, Chang Ho; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Cai, Long; Elowitz, Michael B.",,"Lin, YH; Sohn, CH; Dalal, CK; Cai, L; Elowitz, MB",,,,,54,,"[Lin, Yihan; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Lin, Yihan; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Sohn, Chang Ho; Cai, Long] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15710,Article,1476-4687,melowitz@caltech.edu,58,"NIH [R01 GM079771B, R01 GM086793A]; NSF [1547056]; DARPA [HR0011-05-1-0057]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF2809]; Ellison foundation","We thank U.

138,138.0,"Spontaneous removal of condensed matter from surfaces is exploited in nature and in a broad range of technologies to achieve self-cleaning(1,2), anti-icing(3-6) and condensation control(7,8). But despite much progress(5-7,9-14), our understanding of the phenomena leading to such behaviour remains incomplete, which makes it challenging to rationally design surfaces that benefit from its manifestation(15-18). Here we show that water droplets resting on superhydrophobic textured surfaces in a low-pressure environment can self-remove through sudden spontaneous levitation and subsequent trampoline-like bouncing behaviour, in which sequential collisions with the surface accelerate the droplets. These collisions have restitution coefficients (ratios of relative speeds after and before collision) greater than unity(19) despite complete rigidity of the surface, and thus seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. However, these restitution coefficients result from an overpressure beneath the droplet produced by fast droplet vaporization while substrate adhesion and surface texture restrict vapour flow. We also show that the high vaporization rates experienced by the droplets and the associated cooling can result in freezing from a supercooled state(20,21) that triggers a sudden increase in vaporization, which in turn boosts the levitation process. This effect can spontaneously remove surface icing by lifting away icy drops the moment they freeze. Although these observations are relevant only to systems in a low-pressure environment, they show how surface texturing can produce droplet-surface interactions that prohibit liquid and freezing water-droplet retention on surfaces.","Schutzius, Thomas M.; Jung, Stefan; Maitra, Tanmoy; Graeber, Gustav; Koehme, Moritz; Poulikakos, Dimos",,"Schutzius, TM; Jung, S; Maitra, T; Graeber, G; Kohme, M; Poulikakos, D",,,,,82,,"[Schutzius, Thomas M.; Jung, Stefan; Maitra, Tanmoy; Graeber, Gustav; Koehme, Moritz; Poulikakos, Dimos] ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Lab Thermodynam Emerging Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15738,Article,1476-4687,dpoulikakos@ethz.ch,85,Marie Curie Actions for People COFUND programme [FEL-14 13-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_135479],"T.M.S. acknowledges the ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and the Marie Curie Actions for People COFUND programme (FEL-14 13-1).

141,141.0,"Bipolar disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania and depression; without treatment, 15% of patients commit suicide(1). Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity(2). Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder or animal models', such as reduced glial cell number in the prefrontal cortex of patients(4), upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and C pathways(5-7) and changes in neurotransmission(8-11). However, the roles and causation of these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca2+ imaging, we have observed hyperactive action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs aimed at its clinical treatment.","Mertens, Jerome; Wang, Qiu-Wen; Kim, Yongsung; Yu, Diana X.; Pham, Son; Yang, Bo; Zheng, Yi; Diffenderfer, Kenneth E.; Zhang, Jian; Soltani, Sheila; Eames, Tameji; Schafer, Simon T.; Boyer, Leah; Marchetto, Maria C.; Nurnberger, John I.; Calabrese, Joseph R.; Odegaard, Ketil J.; McCarthy, Michael J.; Zandi, Peter P.; Alba, Martin; Nievergelt, Caroline M.; Mi, Shuangli; Brennand, Kristen J.; Kelsoe, John R.; Gage, Fred H.; Yao, Jun",,"Mertens, J; Wang, QW; Kim, Y; Yu, DX; Pham, S; Yang, B; Zheng, Y; Diffenderfer, KE; Zhang, J; Soltani, S; Eames, T; Schafer, ST; Boyer, L; Marchetto, MC; Nurnberger, JI; Calabrese, JR; Odegaard, KJ; McCarthy, MJ; Zandi, PP; Alba, M; Nievergelt, CM; Mi, SL; Brennand, KJ; Kelsoe, JR; Gage, FH; Yao, J",,,,,95,,"[Mertens, Jerome; Wang, Qiu-Wen; Yang, Bo; Zheng, Yi; Yao, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, State Key Lab Membrane Biol,Tsinghua Peking Joint, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Mertens, Jerome; Kim, Yongsung; Yu, Diana X.; Pham, Son; Soltani, Sheila; Eames, Tameji; Schafer, Simon T.; Boyer, Leah; Marchetto, Maria C.; Gage, Fred H.; Yao, Jun] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Diffenderfer, Kenneth E.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Stem Cell Core, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zhang, Jian; Mi, Shuangli] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Genom, Key Lab Genom & Precis Med, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Nurnberger, John I.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychiat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Calabrese, Joseph R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychiat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Odegaard, Ketil J.] Univ Bergen, Dept Psychiat, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [McCarthy, Michael J.; Kelsoe, John R.] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92151 USA; [McCarthy, Michael J.; Nievergelt, Caroline M.; Kelsoe, John R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zandi, Peter P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychiat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Alba, Martin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychiat, Halifax, NS B3H 2E2, Canada; [Brennand, Kristen J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Yao, Jun] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Language Abil, Xuzhou 221009, Peoples R China",Pharmacogenomics Bipolar Disorder,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15526,Article,1476-4687,jkelsoe@ucsd.edu; gage@salk.edu; jyao@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,99,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471020, 31161120358, 31123004]; National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB910603, 2011CB510106]; Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Engmann Foundation; JPB Foundation; Helmsley Trust; Mather's Foundation; Glenn Foundation for Aging Research; National Institute of Health [MH106056]; New York Stem Cell Foundation - Robertson Award; National Institute of Mental Health [U01 MH92758]; Department of Veterans Affairs [5I01CX000363]","We thank the patients who participated in this study.

147,147.0,"Top-down prefrontal cortex inputs to the hippocampus have been hypothesized to be important in memory consolidation, retrieval, and the pathophysiology of major psychiatric diseases; however, no such direct projections have been identified and functionally described. Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1 region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this projection (here termed AC-CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus while stimulating AC-CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events; these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC-CA projection during memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory representations.","Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl",,"Rajasethupathy, P; Sankaran, S; Marshel, JH; Kim, CK; Ferenczi, E; Lee, SY; Berndt, A; Ramakrishnan, C; Jaffe, A; Lo, M; Liston, C; Deisseroth, K",,,,,653,,"[Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15389,Article,1476-4687,deissero@stanford.edu,659,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Neuro-FAST program; National Institute of Mental Health, National Science Foundation; National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Science Foundation; Simons Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Wiegers Family Fund; Nancy and James Grosfeld Foundation; H.L.

154,154.0,"Ice flow along land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) varies considerably in response to fluctuating inputs of surface meltwater to the bed of the ice sheet. Such inputs lubricate the ice-bed interface, transiently speeding up the flow of ice(1,2). Greater melting results in faster ice motion during summer, but slower motion over the subsequent winter, owing to the evolution of an efficient drainage system that enables water to drain from regions of the ice-sheet bed that have a high basal water pressure(2,3). However, the impact of hydrodynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales remains poorly constrained. Here we show that annual ice motion across an 8,000-km(2) land-terminating region of the west GIS margin, extending to 1,100 m above sea level, was 12% slower in 2007-14 compared with 198594, despite a 50% increase in surface meltwater production. Our findings suggest that, over these three decades, hydrodynamic coupling in this section of the ablation zone resulted in a net slow-down of ice motion (not a speed-up, as previously postulated(1)). Increases in meltwater production from projected climate warming may therefore further reduce the motion of land-terminating margins of the GIS. Our findings suggest that these sectors of the ice sheet are more resilient to the dynamic impacts of enhanced meltwater production than previously thought.","Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel; Hanna, Edward",,"Tedstone, AJ; Nienow, PW; Gourmelen, N; Dehecq, A; Goldberg, D; Hanna, E",,,,,692,,"[Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dehecq, Amaury] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Polytech Annecy Chambery, LISTIC, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15722,Article,1476-4687,a.j.tedstone@ed.ac.uk,695,"UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/152830X/1, NE/J500021/1]; Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award; University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship; European Space Agency Dragon 3 [10302]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales","A.J.T. acknowledges UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) studentships NE/152830X/1 and NE/J500021/1, a Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award, and a University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship.

156,156.0,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","Peifer, Martin;

163,163.0,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a frequent disease in which the genetic alterations determining the clinicobiological behaviour are not fully understood. Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 39 region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to >= 4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.","Puente, Xose S.; Bea, Silvia; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Villamor, Neus; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Munar, Marta; Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Jares, Pedro; Aymerich, Marta; Baumann, Tycho; Beekman, Renee; Belver, Laura; Carrio, Anna; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Colado, Enrique; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Delgado, Julio; Enjuanes, Anna; Estivill, Xavier; Ferrando, Adolfo A.; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Blanca; Gonzalez, Santiago; Gonzalez, Marcos; Gut, Marta; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Nicolas, Pilar; Orozco, Modesto; Payer, Angel R.; Pinyol, Magda; Pisano, David G.; Puente, Diana A.; Queiros, Ana C.; Quesada, Victor; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.; Royo, Cristina; Royo, Romina; Rozman, Maria; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar; Stamatopoulos, Kostas; Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.; Tamborero, David; Terol, Maria J.; Valencia, Alfonso; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Torrents, David; Gut, Ivo; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando; Lopez-Otin, Carlos; Campo, Elias",,"Puente, XS; Bea, S; Valdes-Mas, R; Villamor, N; Gutierrez-Abril, J; Martin-Subero, JI; Munar, M; Rubio-Perez, C; Jares, P; Aymerich, M; Baumann, T; Beekman, R; Belver, L; Carrio, A; Castellano, G; Clot, G; Colado, E; Colomer, D; Costa, D; Delgado, J; Enjuanes, A; Estivill, X; Ferrando, AA; Gelpi, JL; Gonzalez, B; Gonzalez, S; Gonzalez, M; Gut, M; Hernandez-Rivas, JM; Lopez-Guerra, M; Martin-Garcia, D; Navarro, A; Nicolas, P; Orozco, M; Payer, AR; Pinyol, M; Pisano, DG; Puente, DA; Queiros, AC; Quesada, V; Romeo-Casabona, CM; Royo, C; Royo, R; Rozman, M; Russinol, N; Salaverria, I; Stamatopoulos, K; Stunnenberg, HG; Tamborero, D; Terol, MJ; Valencia, A; Lopez-Bigas, N; Torrents, D; Gut, I; Lopez-Guillermo, A; Lopez-Otin, C; Campo, E",,,,,519,,"[Puente, Xose S.; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Puente, Diana A.; Quesada, Victor; Lopez-Otin, Carlos] Univ Oviedo, Inst Univ Oncol IUOPA, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bea, Silvia; Beekman, Renee; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Royo, Cristina; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar] IDIBAPS, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Villamor, Neus; Aymerich, Marta; Carrio, Anna; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Gonzalez, Blanca; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Rozman, Maria; Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Unitat Hematol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Queiros, Ana C.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anat Patol Microbiol & Farmacol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Munar, Marta; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Orozco, Modesto; Royo, Romina; Torrents, David] Univ Barcelona, Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Programa Conjunto Biol Computac, BSC,IRB, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Tamborero, David; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Res Unit Biomed Informat, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Jares, Pedro; Enjuanes, Anna; Pinyol, Magda] IDIBAPS, Unidad Genom, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Baumann, Tycho; Delgado, Julio; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando] IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Serv Hematol, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Belver, Laura; Ferrando, Adolfo A.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Colado, Enrique; Payer, Angel R.] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Serv Hematol, Oviedo 33011, Spain; [Estivill, Xavier] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Hosp Mar Res Inst IMIM, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gonzalez, Marcos; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.] Univ Salamanca, Hosp Univ Salamanca, Ctr Invest Canc, Serv Hematol,IBSAL,CSIC, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Gut, Marta; Gut, Ivo] Ctr Nacl Anal Genom, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Nicolas, Pilar; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.] Univ Basque Country, Univ Deusto, Catedra Interuniv Derecho & Genoma Humano, Bilbao 48007, Spain; [Pisano, David G.; Valencia, Alfonso] Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Stamatopoulos, Kostas] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Appl Biosci, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Mol Biol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Terol, Maria J.] Hosp Clin Valencia, Serv Hematol, Valencia 46010, Spain",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14666,Article,1476-4687,clo@uniovi.es; ecampo@clinic.ub.es,U115,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII); Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC); Banco Santander through its Santander Universities Global Division,"This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC).

169,169.0,"Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow(1-6). At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence(7) and fully turbulent flows(8,9).","Barkley, Dwight; Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Avila, Marc; Hof, Bjoern",,"Barkley, D; Song, BF; Mukund, V; Lemoult, G; Avila, M; Hof, B",,,,,550,,"[Barkley, Dwight] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Hof, Bjoern] IST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Song, Baofang] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Song, Baofang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Multiscale Simulat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Avila, Marc] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Fluid Mech, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15701,Article,1476-4687,D.Barkley@warwick.ac.uk; bhof@ist.ac.at,U191,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1182]; European Research Council under the European Union [306589]; Chinese State Scholarship Fund [2010629145]; International Max Planck Research School for the Physics of Biological and Complex Systems; Gottingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences; Julich Supercomputing Centre [HGU16],"We thank A.

174,174.0,"It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide(1). Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities(2). However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results(3-13). Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high-and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability(14), and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.","Isbell, Forest; Craven, Dylan; Connolly, John; Loreau, Michel; Schmid, Bernhard; Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Bezemer, T.

177,177.0,"The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate controls the emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the ocean floor(1,2). In marine sediments, AOM is performed by dual-species consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhabiting the methane-sulfate transition zone(3-5). The biochemical pathways and biological adaptations enabling this globally relevant process are not fully understood. Here we study the syntrophic interaction in thermophilic AOM (TAOM) between ANME-1 archaea and their consortium partner SRB HotSeep-1 (ref. 6) at 60 degrees C to test the hypothesis of a direct interspecies exchange of electrons(7,8.) The activity of TAOM consortia was compared to the first ANME-free culture of an AOM partner bacterium that grows using hydrogen as the sole electron donor. The thermophilic ANME-1 do not produce sufficient hydrogen to sustain the observed growth of the HotSeep-1 partner. Enhancing the growth of the HotSeep-1 partner by hydrogen addition represses methane oxidation and the metabolic activity of ANME-1. Further supporting the hypothesis of direct electron transfer between the partners, we observe that under TAOM conditions, both ANME and the HotSeep-1 bacteria overexpress genes for extracellular cytochrome production and form cell-to-cell connections that resemble the nanowire structures responsible for interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic consortia of Geobacter(9,10). HotSeep-1 highly expresses genes for pili production only during consortial growth using methane, and the nanowire-like structures are absent in HotSeep-1 cells isolated with hydrogen. These observations suggest that direct electron transfer is a principal mechanism in TAOM, which may also explain the enigmatic functioning and specificity of other methanotrophic ANME-SRB consortia.","Wegener, Gunter; Krukenberg, Viola; Riedel, Dietmar; Tegetmeyer, Halina E.; Boetius, Antje",,"Wegener, G; Krukenberg, V; Riedel, D; Tegetmeyer, HE; Boetius, A",,,,,587,,"[Wegener, Gunter; Krukenberg, Viola; Boetius, Antje] Max Planck Inst Marine Mikrobiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Wegener, Gunter; Boetius, Antje] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Tegetmeyer, Halina E.; Boetius, Antje] Alfred Wegener Inst Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Tegetmeyer, Halina E.] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Biotechnol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15733,Article,1476-4687,gwegener@mpi-bremen.de; vkrukenb@mpi-bremen.de,U315,"DFG Leibniz program; DFG excellence cluster MARUM, Center of Marine Environmental Sciences, Bremen; Max Planck Society","We thank K.

182,182.0,"The altered activity of the fructose transporter GLUT5, an isoform of the facilitated-diffusion glucose transporter family, has been linked to disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLUT5 is also overexpressed in certain tumour cells, and inhibitors are potential drugs for these conditions. Here we describe the crystal structures of GLUT5 from Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus in open outward-and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. GLUT5 has a major facilitator superfamily fold like other homologous monosaccharide transporters. On the basis of a comparison of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, we show that a single point mutation is enough to switch the substrate-binding preference of GLUT5 from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of Escherichia coli XylE suggests that, in addition to global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices TM7 and TM10 underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism in such monosaccharide transporters.","Nomura, Norimichi; Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sonoda, Yo; Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Iwanari, Hiroko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Hamakubo, Takao; Kasahara, Michihiro; Iwata, So; Drew, David",,"Nomura, N; Verdon, G; Kang, HJ; Shimamura, T; Nomura, Y; Sonoda, Y; Hussien, SA; Qureshi, AA; Coincon, M; Sato, Y; Abe, H; Nakada-Nakura, Y; Hino, T; Arakawa, T; Kusano-Arai, O; Iwanari, H; Murata, T; Kobayashi, T; Hamakubo, T; Kasahara, M; Iwata, S; Drew, D",,,,,397,,"[Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Iwata Human Receptor Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Sonoda, Yo; Iwata, So; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Res Complex Harwell, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Hamakubo, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Quantitat Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kasahara, Michihiro] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Lab, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920395, Japan",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14909,Article,1476-4687,nnomura@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; s.iwata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ddrew@dbb.su.se,+,"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Royal Society; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; ERATO Human Receptor Crystallography Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Research Acceleration Program of the JST; Targeted Proteins Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; MEXT [22570114]; MEXT; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Human Frontiers Postdoctoral fellowship; EMBO through Young Investigator Program (YIP)","We are grateful to D.

183,183.0,"The factors shaping cometary nuclei are still largely unknown, but could be the result of concurrent effects of evolutionary(1,2) and primordial processes(3,4). The peculiar bilobed shape of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko may be the result of the fusion of two objects that were once separate or the result of a localized excavation by outgassing at the interface between the two lobes(5). Here we report that the comet's major lobe is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of strata, up to 650 metres thick, which are independent of an analogous stratified envelope on the minor lobe. Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are closer to perpendicular to the strata than those calculated for the entire nucleus and adjacent to the neck separating the two lobes. Therefore comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with 'onion-like' stratification, which formed before they merged. We conclude that gentle, low-velocity collisions occurred between two fully formed kilometre-sized cometesimals in the early stages of the Solar System. The notable structural similarities between the two lobes of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko indicate that the early-forming cometesimals experienced similar primordial stratified accretion, even though they formed independently.","Massironi, Matteo; Simioni, Emanuele; Marzari, Francesco; Cremonese, Gabriele; Giacomini, Lorenza; Pajola, Maurizio; Jorda, Laurent; Naletto, Giampiero; Lowry, Stephen; El-Maarry, Mohamed Ramy; Preusker, Frank; Scholten, Frank; Sierks, Holger; Barbieri, Cesare; Lamy, Philippe; Rodrigo, Rafael; Koschny, Detlef; Rickman, Hans; Keller, Horst Uwe; A'Hearn, Michael F.; Agarwal, Jessica; Auger, Anne-Therese; Barucci, M.

191,191.0,"Execution of accurate eye movements depends critically on the cerebellum(1-3), suggesting that the major output neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, may predict motion of the eye. However, this encoding of action for rapid eye movements (saccades) has remained unclear: Purkinje cells show little consistent modulation with respect to saccade amplitude(4,5) or direction(4), and critically, their discharge lasts longer than the duration of a saccade(6,7). Here we analysed Purkinje-cell discharge in the oculomotor vermis of behaving rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)(8,9) and found neurons that increased or decreased their activity during saccades. We estimated the combined effect of these two populations via their projections to the caudal fastigial nucleus, and uncovered a simple-spike population response that precisely predicted the real-time motion of the eye. When we organized the Purkinje cells according to each cell's complex-spike directional tuning, the simple-spike population response predicted both the real-time speed and direction of saccade multiplicatively via a gain field. This suggests that the cerebellum predicts the real-time motion of the eye during saccades via the combined inputs of Purkinje cells onto individual nucleus neurons. A gain-field encoding of simple spikes emerges if the Purkinje cells that project onto a nucleus neuron are not selected at random but share a common complex-spike property.","Herzfeld, David J.; Kojima, Yoshiko; Soetedjo, Robijanto; Shadmehr, Reza",,"Herzfeld, DJ; Kojima, Y; Soetedjo, R; Shadmehr, R",,,,,439,,"[Herzfeld, David J.; Shadmehr, Reza] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Lab Computat Motor Control, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kojima, Yoshiko; Soetedjo, Robijanto] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington Natl Primate Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15693,Article,1476-4687,dherzfe1@jhmi.edu; shadmehr@jhu.edu,+,"NIH [R01NS078311, R01EY019258, R01EY023277, F31NS090860]","These data were collected in the laboratory of A.

192,192.0,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid-beta peptide(1). Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-beta generation from its precursor, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manne(r)1. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo(2). Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-eta, in addition to the long-known CTF-alpha and CTF-beta fragments generated by the alpha- and beta-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-eta generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as g-secretase activity. g-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP(695), releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-eta is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short A eta peptides (termed A eta-alpha and A eta-beta). CTFs produced by g-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-eta and A eta-alpha. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic A eta-alpha was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by A eta-alpha. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.","Willem, Michael; Tahirovic, Sabina; Busche, Marc Aurel; Ovsepian, Saak V.; Chafai, Magda; Kootar, Scherazad; Hornburg, Daniel; Evans, Lewis D.

196,196.0,"HIV-1 Nef, a protein important for the development of AIDS, has well-characterized effects on host membrane trafficking and receptor downregulation. By an unidentified mechanism, Nef increases the intrinsic infectivity of HIV-1 virions in a host-cell-dependent manner. Here we identify the host transmembrane protein SERINC5, and to a lesser extent SERINC3, as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 particle infectivity that is counteracted by Nef. SERINC5 localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is efficiently incorporated into budding HIV-1 virions and impairs subsequent virion penetration of susceptible target cells. Nef redirects SERINC5 to a Rab7-positive endosomal compartment and thereby excludes it from HIV-1 particles. The ability to counteract SERINC5 was conserved in Nef encoded by diverse primate immunodeficiency viruses, as well as in the structurally unrelated glycosylated Gag from murine leukaemia virus. These examples of functional conservation and convergent evolution emphasize the fundamental importance of SERINC5 as a potent anti-retroviral factor.","Rosa, Annachiara; Chande, Ajit; Ziglio, Serena; De Sanctis, Veronica; Bertorelli, Roberto; Goh, Shih Lin; McCauley, Sean M.; Nowosielska, Anetta; Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Luban, Jeremy; Santoni, Federico Andrea; Pizzato, Massimo",,"Rosa, A; Chande, A; Ziglio, S; De Sanctis, V; Bertorelli, R; Goh, SL; McCauley, SM; Nowosielska, A; Antonarakis, SE; Luban, J; Santoni, FA; Pizzato, M",,,,,212,,"[Rosa, Annachiara; Chande, Ajit; Ziglio, Serena; Pizzato, Massimo] Univ Trent, Ctr Integrat Biol, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [De Sanctis, Veronica; Bertorelli, Roberto] Univ Trent, Lab Biomol Sequence & Struct Anal Hlth, NGS Facil, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Goh, Shih Lin; McCauley, Sean M.; Nowosielska, Anetta; Luban, Jeremy] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Santoni, Federico Andrea] Univ Geneva, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Antonarakis, Stylianos E.] IGE3 Inst Genet & Genom Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15399,Article,1476-4687,massimo.pizzato@unitn.it,+,University of Trento; FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration grant [322130]; Caritro 'Ricerca Biomedica' grant [2013.0248]; National Institute of Health [DP1DA034990]; European Research Council [249968],"We thank the Centre for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, and NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, for cell lines, plasmids and antibodies.

199,199.0,"In the 1980s, excess infrared emission was discovered around main-sequence stars; subsequent direct-imaging observations revealed orbiting disks of cold dust to be the source(1). These 'debris disks' were thought to be by-products of planet formation because they often exhibited morphological and brightness asymmetries that may result from gravitational perturbation by planets. This was proved to be true for the beta Pictoris system, in which the known planet generates an observable warp in the disk(2-5). The nearby, young, unusually active late-type star AU Microscopii hosts a well-studied edge-on debris disk; earlier observations in the visible and near-infrared found asymmetric localized structures in the form of intensity variations along the midplane of the disk beyond a distance of 20 astronomical units(6-9). Here we report high-contrast imaging that reveals a series of five large-scale features in the southeast side of the disk, at projected separations of 10-60 astronomical units, persisting over intervals of 1-4 years. All these features appear to move away from the star at projected speeds of 4-10 kilometres per second, suggesting highly eccentric or unbound trajectories if they are associated with physical entities. The origin, localization, morphology and rapid evolution of these features are difficult to reconcile with current theories.","Boccaletti, Anthony; Thalmann, Christian; Lagrange, Anne-Marie; Janson, Markus; Augereau, Jean-Charles; Schneider, Glenn; Milli, Julien; Grady, Carol; Debes, John; Langlois, Maud; Mouillet, David; Henning, Thomas; Dominik, Carsten; Maire, Anne-Lise; Beuzit, Jean-Luc; Carson, Joseph; Dohlen, Kjetil; Engler, Natalia; Feldt, Markus; Fusco, Thierry; Ginski, Christian; Girard, Julien H.; Hines, Dean; Kasper, Markus; Mawet, Dimitri; Menard, Franois; Meyer, Michael R.; Moutou, Claire; Olofsson, Johan; Rodigas, Timothy; Sauvage, Jean-Francois; Schlieder, Joshua; Schmid, Hans Martin; Turatto, Massimo; Udry, Stephane; Vakili, Farrokh; Vigan, Arthur; Wahhaj, Zahed; Wisniewski, John",,"Boccaletti, A; Thalmann, C; Lagrange, AM; Janson, M; Augereau, JC; Schneider, G; Milli, J; Grady, C; Debes, J; Langlois, M; Mouillet, D; Henning, T; Dominik, C; Maire, AL; Beuzit, JL; Carson, J; Dohlen, K; Engler, N; Feldt, M; Fusco, T; Ginski, C; Girard, JH; Hines, D; Kasper, M; Mawet, D; Menard, F; Meyer, MR; Moutou, C; Olofsson, J; Rodigas, T; Sauvage, JF; Schlieder, J; Schmid, HM; Turatto, M; Udry, S; Vakili, F; Vigan, A; Wahhaj, Z; Wisniewski, J",,,,,230,,"[Boccaletti, Anthony] Univ Paris 06, Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Observ Paris,LESIA, F-92190 Meudon, France; [Thalmann, Christian; Engler, Natalia; Meyer, Michael R.; Schmid, Hans Martin] ETH, Inst Astron, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lagrange, Anne-Marie; Augereau, Jean-Charles; Mouillet, David; Beuzit, Jean-Luc] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Lagrange, Anne-Marie; Augereau, Jean-Charles; Milli, Julien; Beuzit, Jean-Luc; Girard, Julien H.; Kasper, Markus] IPAG, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Janson, Markus] Stockholm Univ, Dept Astron, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Janson, Markus; Henning, Thomas; Carson, Joseph; Olofsson, Johan] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schneider, Glenn] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Milli, Julien; Girard, Julien H.; Vigan, Arthur; Wahhaj, Zahed] ESO, Santiago 19001, Chile; [Grady, Carol] Eureka Sci, Oakland, CA 96002 USA; [Debes, John; Hines, Dean] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Langlois, Maud] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Ctr Rech Astrophys Lyon, ENS L, F-69561 St Genis Laval, France; [Langlois, Maud; Dohlen, Kjetil; Fusco, Thierry; Moutou, Claire; Sauvage, Jean-Francois; Vigan, Arthur; Wahhaj, Zahed] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LAM, UMR 7326, F-13388 Marseille, France; [Dominik, Carsten] Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Maire, Anne-Lise; Turatto, Massimo] INAF Osservatorio Astron Padova, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Carson, Joseph] Coll Charleston, Dept Phys & Astron, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Fusco, Thierry; Sauvage, Jean-Francois] Off Natl Etud & Rech Aerosp, F-92322 Chatillon, France; [Ginski, Christian] Sterrewacht Leiden, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Kasper, Markus] ESO, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Mawet, Dimitri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Menard, Franois] INSU France, CNRS, UMI, FCA,UMI 3386, Montpellier, France; [Menard, Franois] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; [Rodigas, Timothy] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Schlieder, Joshua] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Space Sci & Astrobiol Div, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Udry, Stephane] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneve, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Vakili, Farrokh] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis UNS, CNRS, Lab JL Lagrange, OCA, F-06108 Nice 2, France; [Wisniewski, John] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Phys & Astron, Norman, OK 73019 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15705,Article,1476-4687,anthony.boccaletti@obspm.fr,+,"ESO; CNRS; MPIA; INAF; FINES; NOVA; European Commission FP6 programme as part of OPTICON [RII3-Ct-2004-001566]; European Commission FP7 programme as part of OPTICON [226604, 312430]; Swiss National Science Foundation; SNSF; ESO Very Large Telescope [60.A-9249]; NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope [12228]; NASA [NAS 5-26555];  [ANR-14-CE33-0018]","SPHERE was built by a European consortium led by IPAG (France).

204,204.0,"The Trivers-Willard theory(1) proposes that the sex ratio of offspring should vary with maternal condition when it has sex-specific influences on offspring fitness. In particular, mothers in good condition in polygynous and dimorphic species are predicted to produce an excess of sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should do the opposite. Despite the elegance of the theory, support for it has been limited(2,3). Here we extend and generalize the Trivers-Willard theory to explain the disparity between predictions and observations of offspring sex ratio. In polygynous species, males typically have higher mortality rates(4), different age-specific reproductive schedules and more risk-prone life history tactics than females; however, these differences are not currently incorporated into the Trivers-Willard theory. Using two-sex models parameterized with data from free-living mammal populations with contrasting levels of sex differences in demography, we demonstrate how sex differences in life history traits over the entire lifespan can lead to a wide range of sex allocation tactics, and show that correlations between maternal condition and offspring sex ratio alone are insufficient to conclude that mothers adaptively adjust offspring sex ratio.","Schindler, Susanne; Gaillard, Jean-Michel; Gruening, Andre; Neuhaus, Peter; Traill, Lochran W.; Tuljapurkar, Shripad; Coulson, Tim",,"Schindler, S; Gaillard, JM; Gruning, A; Neuhaus, P; Traill, LW; Tuljapurkar, S; Coulson, T",,,,,249,,"[Schindler, Susanne; Coulson, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Gaillard, Jean-Michel] Univ Lyon 1, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Gruening, Andre] Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Neuhaus, Peter] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Traill, Lochran W.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Tuljapurkar, Shripad] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14968,Article,1476-4687,Susanne.Schindler@zoo.ox.ac.uk,+,ERC Advanced Grant; Swiss National Science Foundation [SNF 3100AO-109816]; European Commission (Marie Curie Fellowship) [254442]; Carnegie Corporation of New York [B8749.R01],"We thank Y.

205,205.0,"The high prevalence of sickle haemoglobin in Africa shows that malaria has been a major force for human evolutionary selection, but surprisingly few other polymorphisms have been proven to confer resistance to malaria in large epidemiological studies(1-3). To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.76, P value = 9.5 x 10(-11)) and is linked to polymorphisms that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees(4). Taken together with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O-1-3,O-5, these data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights into the host-parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome of malaria infection.","Band, Gavin; Rockett, Kirk A.; Spencer, Chris C.

In extensively phenotyped cohorts we characterize over 24 million novel sequence variants, generate a highly accurate imputation reference panel and identify novel alleles associated with levels of triglycerides (APOB), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLR and RGAG1) from single-marker and rare variant aggregation tests. We describe population structure and functional annotation of rare and low-frequency variants, use the data to estimate the benefits of sequencing for association studies, and summarize lessons from disease-specific collections. Finally, we make available an extensive resource, including individual-level genetic and phenotypic data and web-based tools to facilitate the exploration of association results.","Walter, Klaudia; Min, Josine L.; Huang, Jie; Crooks, Lucy; Memari, Yasin; McCarthy, Shane; Perry, John R.

215,215.0,"The fast growth of information technology has been sustained by continuous scaling down of the silicon-based metal-oxide field-effect transistor. However, such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling. First, the device electrostatics (the ability of the transistor's gate electrode to control its channel potential) are degraded when the channel length is decreased, using conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel. Recently, two-dimensional semiconducting materials(1-7) have emerged as promising candidates to replace silicon, as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at much reduced channel lengths. The second, more severe, challenge is that the supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of turn-on characteristics, or subthreshold swing(8,9). To enable scaling to continue without a power penalty, a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain subthermionic subthreshold swing, such as band-to-band tunnelling(10-16). Here we demonstrate band-to-band tunnel field-effect transistors (tunnelFETs), based on a two-dimensional semiconductor, that exhibit steep turn-on; subthreshold swing is a minimum of 3.9 millivolts per decade and an average of 31.1 millivolts per decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature. By using highly doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the channel, a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics, a strain-free heterointerface, a lowtunnelling barrier, and a large tunnelling area. Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET(ATLAS-TFET) is the only planar architecture tunnel-FET to achieve subthermionic subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current, as recommended in ref. 17, and is also the only tunnel-FET(inany architecture) to achieve this at a low power-supply voltage of 0.1 volts. Our device is at present the thinnest-channel subthermionic transistor, and has the potential to open up new avenues for ultra-dense and low-power integrated circuits, as well as for ultra-sensitive biosensors and gas sensors(18-21).","Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Gong, Yongji; Kraemer, Stephan; Ajayan, Pulickel M.; Banerjee, Kaustav",,"Sarkar, D; Xie, XJ; Liu, W; Cao, W; Kang, JH; Gong, YJ; Kraemer, S; Ajayan, PM; Banerjee, K",,,,,91,,"[Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Banerjee, Kaustav] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gong, Yongji; Ajayan, Pulickel M.] Rice Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Nanoengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Kraemer, Stephan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15387,Article,1476-4687,kaustav@ece.ucsb.edu,95,Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0268]; US NSF [CCF-1162633]; Army Research Office (MURI) [W911NF-11-1-0362]; MRSEC Program of the NSF [DMR1121053]; NSF-funded Materials Research Facilities Network,"This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant FA9550-14-1-0268) and the US NSF (grant CCF-1162633).

224,224.0,"Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer, metastasis remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality(1). Understanding metastasis initiation and progression is critical to developing new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic disease. Prevailing theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumour cells with unique properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and propagate metastatic tumours(2-5). However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer remains elusive, and whether metastases are hierarchically organized is unknown(2). Here we show at the single-cell level that early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression signature. To identify and isolate metastatic cells from patient-derived xenograft models of human breast cancer, we developed a highly sensitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based assay, which allowed us to enumerate metastatic cells in mouse peripheral tissues. We compared gene signatures in metastatic cells from tissues with low versus high metastatic burden. Metastatic cells from low-burden tissues were distinct owing to their increased expression of stem cell, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, pro-survival, and dormancy-associated genes. By contrast, metastatic cells from high-burden tissues were similar to primary tumour cells, which were more heterogeneous and expressed higher levels of luminal differentiation genes. Transplantation of stem-like metastatic cells from low-burden tissues showed that they have considerable tumour-initiating capacity, and can differentiate to produce luminal-like cancer cells. Progression to high metastatic burden was associated with increased proliferation and MYC expression, which could be attenuated by treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. These findings support a hierarchical model for metastasis, in which metastases are initiated by stem-like cells that proliferate and differentiate to produce advanced metastatic disease.","Lawson, Devon A.; Bhakta, Nirav R.; Kessenbrock, Kai; Prummel, Karin D.; Yu, Ying; Takai, Ken; Zhou, Alicia; Eyob, Henok; Balakrishnan, Sanjeev; Wang, Chih-Yang; Yaswen, Paul; Goga, Andrei; Werb, Zena",,"Lawson, DA; Bhakta, NR; Kessenbrock, K; Prummel, KD; Yu, Y; Takai, K; Zhou, A; Eyob, H; Balakrishnan, S; Wang, CY; Yaswen, P; Goga, A; Werb, Z",,,,,131,,"[Lawson, Devon A.; Kessenbrock, Kai; Prummel, Karin D.; Yu, Ying; Takai, Ken; Wang, Chih-Yang; Werb, Zena] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bhakta, Nirav R.; Goga, Andrei] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kessenbrock, Kai; Zhou, Alicia; Eyob, Henok; Balakrishnan, Sanjeev; Goga, Andrei] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Chih-Yang] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Basic Med Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Yaswen, Paul] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15260,Article,1476-4687,andrei.goga@ucsf.edu; zena.werb@ucsf.edu,+,"National Cancer Institute [CA180039, CA136717]; Stand Up To Cancer/AACR [DT0409]; Era of Hope Scholar Award [W81XWH-12-1-0272]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Atwater Foundation; US Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program postdoctoral fellowship [11-1-0742]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2917-I-006-002]","We thank A.

226,226.0,"Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and innerring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to forma central channel of similar to 60 nm in diameter(1). The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block-although compositionally identical-engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.","von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Vollmer, Benjamin; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Antonin, Wolfram; Glavy, Joseph S.; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin",,"von Appen, A; Kosinski, J; Sparks, L; Ori, A; DiGuilio, AL; Vollmer, B; Mackmull, MT; Banterle, N; Parca, L; Kastritis, P; Buczak, K; Mosalaganti, S; Hagen, W; Andres-Pons, A; Lemke, EA; Bork, P; Antonin, W; Glavy, JS; Bui, KH; Beck, M",,,,,140,,"[von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Glavy, Joseph S.] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Vollmer, Benjamin; Antonin, Wolfram] Max Planck Gesell, Friedrich Miescher Lab, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bui, Khanh Huy] McGill Univ, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C7, Canada",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15381,Article,1476-4687,huy.bui@mcgill.ca; martin.beck@embl.de,+,EMBL's mechanical workshop; Electron Microscopy and Proteomics Core Facilities; Centre for Statistical Data Analysis; Swiss National Science Foundation; European Molecular Biology Organization; Marie Curie Actions; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Robert Crooks Stanley Fellowship at the Stevens Institute of Technology; National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme under Marie Curie COFUND Actions; Ignition Grant Initiative from Stevens Institute of Technology; NIA [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL; European Research Council [309271-NPCAtlas],"We are grateful to W.

228,228.0,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, 43S complexes, comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1 and 1A, attach to the 59-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at,6 angstrom resolution. It reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits. The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are discussed.","des Georges, Amedee; Dhote, Vidya; Kuhn, Lauriane; Hellen, Christopher U.

239,239.0,"Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)(1,2), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers(3-5). While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies(6), mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9; Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistantmouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Roe, Jae-Seok; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Dow, Lukas E.; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Valent, Peter; Stark, Alexander; Kraut, Norbert; Vakoc, Christopher R.; Zuber, Johannes",,"Rathert, P; Roth, M; Neumann, T; Muerdter, F; Roe, JS; Muhar, M; Deswal, S; Cerny-Reiterer, S; Peter, B; Jude, J; Hoffmann, T; Boryn, LM; Axelsson, E; Schweifer, N; Tontsch-Grunt, U; Dow, LE; Gianni, D; Pearson, M; Valent, P; Stark, A; Kraut, N; Vakoc, CR; Zuber, J",,,,,543,,"[Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Stark, Alexander; Zuber, Johannes] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Roe, Jae-Seok; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Kraut, Norbert] Boehringer Ingelheim Reg Ctr Vienna GmbH, A-1121 Vienna, Austria; [Dow, Lukas E.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14898,Article,1476-4687,zuber@imp.ac.at,+,"European Research Council (ERC) [336860]; SFB of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4704, F4710]; European Union; ERC [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We thank M.

240,240.0,"To contend with hazards posed by environmental fluoride, microorganisms export this anion through F--specific ion channels of the Fluc family(1-4). Since the recent discovery of Fluc channels, numerous idiosyncratic features of these proteins have been unearthed, including strong selectivity for F- over Cl- and dual-topology dimeric assembly(5,6). To understand the chemical basis for F- permeation and how the antiparallel subunits convene to form a F--selective pore, here we solve the crystal structures of two bacterial Fluc homologues in complex with three different monobody inhibitors, with and without F- present, to a maximum resolution of 2.1 angstrom. The structures reveal a surprising 'double-barrelled' channel architecture in which two F- ion pathways span the membrane, and the dual-topology arrangement includes a centrally coordinated cation, most likely Na+center dot F- selectivity is proposed to arise from the very narrow pores and an unusual anion coordination that exploits the quadrupolar edges of conserved phenylalanine rings.","Stockbridge, Randy B.; Kolmakova-Partensky, Ludmila; Shane, Tania; Koide, Akiko; Koide, Shohei; Miller, Christopher; Newstead, Simon",,"Stockbridge, RB; Kolmakova-Partensky, L; Shane, T; Koide, A; Koide, S; Miller, C; Newstead, S",,,,,548,,"[Stockbridge, Randy B.; Kolmakova-Partensky, Ludmila; Shane, Tania; Miller, Christopher] Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Koide, Akiko; Koide, Shohei] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Miller, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Newstead, Simon] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14981,Article,1476-4687,simon.newstead@bioch.ox.ac.uk,+,"Wellcome Trust [102890/Z/13/Z]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1-GM107023, U54-GM087519]; NIH [K99-GM-111767]","We are grateful to J.

242,242.0,"Macromolecular complexes are essential to conserved biological processes, but their prevalence across animals is unclear. By combining extensive biochemical fractionation with quantitative mass spectrometry, here we directly examined the composition of soluble multiprotein complexes among diverse metazoan models. Using an integrative approach, we generated a draft conservation map consisting of more than one million putative high-confidence co-complex interactions for species with fully sequenced genomes that encompasses functional modules present broadly across all extant animals. Clustering reveals a spectrum of conservation, ranging from ancient eukaryotic assemblies that have probably served cellular housekeeping roles for at least one billion years, ancestral complexes that have accrued contemporary components, and rarer metazoan innovations linked to multicellularity. We validated these projections by independent co-fractionation experiments in evolutionarily distant species, affinity purification and functional analyses. The comprehensiveness, centrality and modularity of these reconstructed interactomes reflect their fundamental mechanistic importance and adaptive value to animal cell systems.","Wan, Cuihong; Borgeson, Blake; Phanse, Sadhna; Tu, Fan; Drew, Kevin; Clark, Greg; Xiong, Xuejian; Kagan, Olga; Kwan, Julian; Bezginov, Alexandr; Chessman, Kyle; Pal, Swati; Cromar, Graham; Papoulas, Ophelia; Ni, Zuyao; Boutz, Daniel R.; Stoilova, Snejana; Havugimana, Pierre C.; Guo, Xinghua; Malty, Ramy H.; Sarov, Mihail; Greenblatt, Jack; Babu, Mohan; Derry, W.

261,261.0,"Resonance fluorescence arises from the interaction of an optical field with a two-level system, and has played a fundamental role in the development of quantum optics and its applications. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it entails a wide range of intriguing phenomena, such as the Mollow-triplet emission spectrum(1), photon antibunching(2) and coherent photon emission(3). One fundamental aspect of resonance fluorescence-squeezing in the form of reduced quantum fluctuations in the single photon stream from an atom in free space-was predicted more than 30 years ago(4). However, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime, together with the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low collection efficiencies, has continued to necessitate stringent experimental conditions for the observation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent these issues had to sacrifice antibunching, owing to either stimulated forward scattering from atomic ensembles(5,6) or multi-photon transitions inside optical cavities(7,8). Here, we use an artificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling 100-fold improvement of the photon detection rate over the natural atom counterpart(9) and reach the necessary conditions for the observation of quadrature squeezing in single resonance-fluorescence photons. By implementing phase-dependent homodyne intensity-correlation detection(9-11), we demonstrate that the electric field quadrature variance of resonance fluorescence is three per cent below the fundamental limit set by vacuum fluctuations, while the photon statistics remain antibunched. The presence of squeezing and antibunching simultaneously is a fully non-classical outcome of the wave-particle duality of photons.","Schulte, Carsten H.

268,268.0,"Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids(1), cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances(2). Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells(3). Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells.

278,278.0,"Metamaterials, man-made composite media structured on a scale much smaller than a wavelength, offer surprising possibilities for engineering the propagation of waves(1-6). One of the most interesting of these is the ability to achieve superlensing-that is, to focus or image beyond the diffraction limit(7). This originates from the left-handed behaviour-the property of refracting waves negatively-that is typical of negative index metamaterials(8-10). Yet reaching this goal requires the design of 'double negative' metamaterials, which act simultaneously on the permittivity and permeability in electromagnetics(11,12), or on the density and compressibility in acoustics; this generally implies the use of two different kinds of building blocks(13,14) or specific particles presenting multiple overlapping resonances(15-17). Such a requirement limits the applicability of double negative metamaterials, and has, for example, hampered any demonstration of subwavelength focusing using left-handed acoustic metamaterials(18). Here we show that these strict conditions can be largely relaxed by relying on media that consist of only one type of single resonant unit cell. Specifically, we show with a simple yet general semi-analytical model that judiciously breaking the symmetry of a single negative metamaterial is sufficient to turn it into a double negative one. We then demonstrate that this occurs solely because of multiple scattering of waves off the metamaterial resonant elements, a phenomenon often disregarded in these media owing to their subwavelength patterning. We apply our approach to acoustics and verify through numerical simulations that it allows the realization of negative index acoustic metamaterials based on Helmholtz resonators only. Finally, we demonstrate the operation of a negative index acoustic superlens, achieving subwavelength focusing and imaging with spot width and resolution 7 and 3.5 times better than the diffraction limit, respectively. Our findings have profound implications for the physics of metamaterials, highlighting the role of their subwavelength crystalline structure, and hence entering the realm of metamaterial crystals. This widens the scope of possibilities for designing composite media with novel properties in a much simpler way than has been possible so far.","Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy",,"Kaina, N; Lemoult, F; Fink, M; Lerosey, G",,,,,77,,"[Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14678,Article,1476-4687,geoffroy.lerosey@espci.fr,+,"LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"") [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JS09-0001-01]; French ""Direction Generale de l'Armement""","We thank A.

279,279.0,"DNA origami is a robust assembly technique that folds a single-stranded DNA template into a target structure by annealing it with hundreds of short 'staple' strands(1-4.) Its guiding design principle is that the target structure is the single most stable configuration(5). The folding transition is cooperative(4,6,7) and, as in the case of proteins, is governed by information encoded in the polymer sequence(8-11). A typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield(2). Although adjusting assembly conditions(2,12) or following empirical design rules(12,13) can improve yield, well-folded origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures(2,3,14-16). The problem could in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures. Expanding the rational design process to include the assembly pathway should thus enable more reproducible synthesis, particularly when targeting more complex structures. We anticipate that this expansion will be essential if DNA origami is to continue its rapid development(1-3,17-19) and become a reliable manufacturing technology(20).","Dunn, Katherine E.; Dannenberg, Frits; Ouldridge, Thomas E.; Kwiatkowska, Marta; Turberfield, Andrew J.; Bath, Jonathan",,"Dunn, KE; Dannenberg, F; Ouldridge, TE; Kwiatkowska, M; Turberfield, AJ; Bath, J",,,,,82,,"[Dunn, Katherine E.; Dannenberg, Frits; Turberfield, Andrew J.; Bath, Jonathan] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Dannenberg, Frits; Kwiatkowska, Marta] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 3QD, England; [Ouldridge, Thomas E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Rudolf Peierls Ctr Theoret Phys, Oxford OX1 3NP, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14860,Article,1476-4687,a.turberfield@physics.ox.ac.uk; j.bath@physics.ox.ac.uk,+,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G037930/1, EP/P504287/1]; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0030/2013]; Microsoft Research PhD Scholarship; ERC Advanced Grant VERIWARE; Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award","We thank K.V.

283,283.0,"All around the globe, humans have greatly altered the abiotic and biotic environment with ever-increasing speed. One defining feature of the Anthropocene epoch(1,2) is the erosion of biogeographical barriers by human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions, where they can naturalize and cause ecological, economic and social damage(3). So far, no comprehensive analysis of the global accumulation and exchange of alien plant species between continents has been performed, primarily because of a lack of data. Here we bridge this knowledge gap by using a unique global database on the occurrences of naturalized alien plant species in 481 mainland and 362 island regions. In total, 13,168 plant species, corresponding to 3.9% of the extant global vascular flora, or approximately the size of the native European flora, have become naturalized somewhere on the globe as a result of human activity. North America has accumulated the largest number of naturalized species, whereas the Pacific Islands show the fastest increase in species numbers with respect to their land area. Continents in the Northern Hemisphere have been the major donors of naturalized alien species to all other continents. Our results quantify for the first time the extent of plant naturalizations worldwide, and illustrate the urgent need for globally integrated efforts to control, manage and understand the spread of alien species.","van Kleunen, Mark;

284,284.0,"Genetic studies have consistently indicated a single common origin of Native American groups from Central and South America(1-4). However, some morphological studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian affinities of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology seen in some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with present-day Australasians (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island Southeast Asia)(5-8). Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in a similar to 12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.","Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Bortolini, Maria Catira; Chennagiri, Niru; Huenemeier, Tabita; Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza; Salzano, Francisco Mauro; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David",,"Skoglund, P; Mallick, S; Bortolini, MC; Chennagiri, N; Hunemeier, T; Petzl-Erler, ML; Salzano, FM; Patterson, N; Reich, D",,,,,104,,"[Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bortolini, Maria Catira; Salzano, Francisco Mauro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Huenemeier, Tabita] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Genet Biol Evolut, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Genet, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14895,Article,1476-4687,skoglund@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Brazil); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Brazil); Wenner-Gren foundation; Swedish Research Council (VR) [2014-453]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Simons Foundation [280376]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We are grateful to the Native American volunteers who contributed the DNA samples used to generate the new data reported in this study and to the Fundacao Nacional do Indio (FUNAI, Brazil) for logistical support in sample collection.

The impact of transforming events on fate conversion in cancer cells of origin and thus their contribution to tumour heterogeneity remains largely elusive. Using in situ genetic lineage tracing and limiting dilution transplantation, we have unravelled the potential of PIK3CA(H1047R), one of the most frequent mutations occurring in human breast cancer(5), to induce multipotency during tumorigenesis in the mammary gland. Here we show that expression of PIK3CA(H1047R) in lineage-committed basal Lgr5-positive and luminal keratin-8-positive cells of the adult mouse mammary gland evokes cell dedifferentiation into a multipotent stem-like state, suggesting this to be a mechanism involved in the formation of heterogeneous, multi-lineage mammary tumours. Moreover, we show that the tumour cell of origin influences the frequency of malignant mammary tumours. Our results define a key effect of PIK3CA(H1047R) on mammary cell fate in the pre-neoplastic mammary gland and show that the cell of origin of PIK3CA(H1047R) tumours dictates their malignancy, thus revealing a mechanism underlying tumour heterogeneity and aggressiveness.","Koren, Shany; Reavie, Linsey; Couto, Joana Pinto; De Silva, Duvini; Stadler, Michael B.; Roloff, Tim; Britschgi, Adrian; Eichlisberger, Tobias; Kohler, Hubertus; Aina, Olulanu; Cardiff, Robert D.; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed",,"Koren, S; Reavie, L; Couto, JP; De Silva, D; Stadler, MB; Roloff, T; Britschgi, A; Eichlisberger, T; Kohler, H; Aina, O; Cardiff, RD; Bentires-Alj, M",,,,,114,,"[Koren, Shany; Reavie, Linsey; Couto, Joana Pinto; De Silva, Duvini; Stadler, Michael B.; Roloff, Tim; Britschgi, Adrian; Eichlisberger, Tobias; Kohler, Hubertus; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res FMI, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Stadler, Michael B.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Aina, Olulanu; Cardiff, Robert D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pathol, Ctr Comparat Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14669,Article,1476-4687,Bentires@fmi.ch,+,National Cancer Institute [U01 CA141582]; Novartis Research Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [243211-PTPsBDC]; Swiss Cancer League; Swiss National Foundation; Krebsliga Beider Basel,"The authors thank R.

291,291.0,"Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) require large quantities of copper for the membrane-bound (particulate) methane monooxygenase(1,2). Certain methanotrophs are also able to switch to using the iron-containing soluble methane monooxygenase to catalyse methane oxidation, with this switchover regulated by copper(3,4). Methane monooxygenases are nature's primary biological mechanism for suppressing atmospheric levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Furthermore, methanotrophs and methane monooxygenases have enormous potential in bioremediation and for biotransformations producing bulk and fine chemicals, and in bioenergy, particularly considering increased methane availability from renewable sources and hydraulic fracturing of shale rock(5,6). Here we discover and characterize a novel copper storage protein (Csp1) from the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b that is exported from the cytosol, and stores copper for particulate methane monooxygenase. Csp1 is a tetramer of four-helix bundles with each monomer binding up to 13 Cu(I) ions in a previously unseen manner via mainly Cys residues that point into the core of the bundle. Csp1 is the first example of a protein that stores a metal within an established protein-folding motif. This work provides a detailed insight into how methanotrophs accumulate copper for the oxidation of methane. Understanding this process is essential if the wide-ranging biotechnological applications of methanotrophs are to be realized. Cytosolic homologues of Csp1 are present in diverse bacteria, thus challenging the dogma that such organisms do not use copper in this location.","Vita, Nicolas; Platsaki, Semeli; Basle, Arnaud; Allen, Stephen J.; Paterson, Neil G.; Crombie, Andrew T.; Murrell, J.

295,295.0,"Most exoplanetary systems in binary stars are of S-type, and consist of one or more planets orbiting a primary star with a wide binary stellar companion(1,2). Planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations can be large(3,4), perhaps forced gravitationally by the binary companion(4-6). Earlier work on single planet systems(5,7-10) appealed to the Kozai-Lidov instability(11,12) wherein a sufficiently inclined binary orbit excites large-amplitude oscillations in the planet's eccentricity and inclination. The instability, however, can be quenched by many agents that induce fast orbital precession, including mutual gravitational forces in a multiplanet system(5,13). Here we report that orbital precession, which inhibits Kozai-Lidov cycling in a multiplanet system, can become fast enough to resonate with the orbital motion of a distant binary companion. Resonant binary forcing results in dramatic outcomes ranging from the excitation of large planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations to total disruption. Processes such as planetary migration(14,15) can bring an initially non-resonant system into resonance. As it does not require special physical or initial conditions, binary resonant driving is generic and may have altered the architecture of many multiplanet systems. It can also weaken the multiplanet occurrence rate in wide binaries, and affect planet formation in close binaries.","Touma, Jihad R.; Sridhar, S.",,"Touma, JR; Sridhar, S",,,,,439,,"[Touma, Jihad R.] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Phys, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Sridhar, S.] Raman Res Inst, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14873,Article,1476-4687,jihad.touma@aub.edu.lb,441,,,CP7LN,,,,,STELLAR MULTIPLICITY; PLANETARY SYSTEM; PERTURBATIONS; MIGRATION; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; ECCENTRICITY; COMPANIONS; BODIES; STARS,7566.0,NATURE,Nature,English,,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Aug,3.0,LONDON,26310763.0,,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,"Sridhar, S/D-4895-2012","Touma, JR (reprint author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Phys, POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,0028-0836,NATURE,,,5.0,The disruption of multiplanet systems through resonance with a binary orbit,1.0,9.0,WOS:000360069300031,524,Multidisciplinary Sciences,5,s.,sridhar,9065,1,female,1,kDuCdb4AAAAJ,50489393,1
301,301.0,"The sudden appearance of the neural crest and neurogenic placodes in early branching vertebrates has puzzled biologists for over a century(1). These embryonic tissues contribute to the development of the cranium and associated sensory organs, which were crucial for the evolution of the vertebrate ""new head""(2,3). Aprevious study suggests that rudimentary neural crest cells existed in ancestral chordates(4). However, the evolutionary origins of neurogenic placodes have remained obscure owing to a paucity of embryonic data from tunicates, the closest living relatives to those early vertebrates(5). Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis exhibits a proto-placodal ectoderm (PPE) that requires inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and expresses the key regulatory determinant Six1/ 2 and its co-factor Eya, a developmental process conserved across vertebrates. The Ciona PPE is shown to produce ciliated neurons that express genes for gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), a G-protein-coupled receptor for relaxin-3 (RXFP3) and a functional cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA), which suggests dual chemosensory and neurosecretory activities. These observations provide evidence that Ciona has a neurogenic proto-placode, which forms neurons that appear to be related to those derived from the olfactory placode and hypothalamic neurons of vertebrates. We discuss the possibility that the PPE-derived GnRH neurons of Ciona resemble an ancestral cell type, a progenitor to the complex neuronal circuit that integrates sensory information and neuroendocrine functions in vertebrates.","Abitua, Philip Barron; Gainous, T.

304,304.0,"Cell-cell intercalation is used in several developmental processes to shape the normal body plan(1). There is no clear evidence that intercalation is involved in pathologies. Here we use the proto-oncogene myc to study a process analogous to early phase of tumour expansion: myc-induced cell competition(2-7). Cell competition is a conserved mechanism(5,6,8,9) driving the elimination of slow-proliferating cells (so-called 'losers') by faster-proliferating neighbours (so-called 'winners') through apoptosis(10) and is important in preventing developmental malformations and maintain tissue fitness(11). Here we show, using long-term live imaging of myc-driven competition in the Drosophila pupal notum and in the wing imaginal disc, that the probability of elimination of loser cells correlates with the surface of contact shared with winners. As such, modifying loser-winner interface morphology can modulate the strength of competition. We further show that elimination of loser clones requires winner-loser cell mixing through cell-cell intercalation. Cell mixing is driven by differential growth and the high tension at winner-winner interfaces relative to winner-loser and loser-loser interfaces, which leads to a preferential stabilization of winner-loser contacts and reduction of clone compactness over time. Differences in tension are generated by a relative difference in F-actin levels between loser and winner junctions, induced by differential levels of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Our results establish the first link between cell-cell intercalation induced by a proto-oncogene and how it promotes invasiveness and destruction of healthy tissues.","Levayer, Romain; Hauert, Barbara; Moreno, Eduardo",,"Levayer, R; Hauert, B; Moreno, E",,,,,476,,"[Levayer, Romain; Hauert, Barbara; Moreno, Eduardo] Univ Bern, Inst Cell Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14684,Article,1476-4687,eduardo.moreno@izb.unibe.ch,+,EMBO [ALTF 366-2012]; Human Frontier post-doctoral fellowship [LT000178/2013]; European Research Council; Swiss National Science Foundation; Josef Steiner Cancer Research Foundation; Swiss Cancer League,"We thank members of the Moreno laboratory for reading this manuscript.

307,307.0,"Cell division requires the precise coordination of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. This coordination is achieved by the recruitment of an actomyosin regulator, Ect2, to overlapping microtubules at the centre of the elongating anaphase spindle(1). Ect2 then signals to the overlying cortex to promote the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin ring between segregating chromosomes(1). Here, by studying division in proliferating Drosophila and human cells, we demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel signalling pathway, which triggers the relaxation of the polar cell cortex at mid anaphase. This is independent of furrow formation, centrosomes and microtubules and, instead, depends on PP1 phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 (refs 2, 3). As separating chromosomes move towards the polar cortex at mid anaphase, kinetochore-localized PP1-Sds22 helps to break cortical symmetry by inducing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins at cell poles. This promotes local softening of the cortex(2,3), facilitating anaphase elongation and orderly cell division. In summary, this identifies a conserved kinetochore-based phosphatase signal and substrate, which function together to link anaphase chromosome movements to cortical polarization, thereby coupling chromosome segregation to cell division.","Rodrigues, Nelio T.

315,315.0,"Nearly three-quarters of the growth in global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China(1,2). Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3 gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent(1,3-5). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics(6), that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7), and that emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates(1,4). Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/-7.3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories(1,4,8). Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions(1,4). Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 (2.66 gigatonnes of carbon)(9) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6 gigatonnes of carbon)(10).","Liu, Zhu;

318,318.0,"Tropical mountains are hot spots of biodiversity and endemism(1-3), but the evolutionary origins of their unique biotas are poorly understood(4). In varying degrees, local and regional extinction, long-distance colonization, and local recruitment may all contribute to the exceptional character of these communities(5). Also, it is debated whether mountain endemics mostly originate from local lowland taxa, or from lineages that reach the mountain by long-range dispersal from cool localities elsewhere(6). Here we investigate the evolutionary routes to endemism by sampling an entire tropical mountain biota on the 4,095-metre-high Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, East Malaysia. We discover that most of its unique biodiversity is younger than the mountain itself (6 million years), and comprises a mix of immigrant pre-adapted lineages and descendants from local lowland ancestors, although substantial shifts from lower to higher vegetation zones in this latter group were rare. These insights could improve forecasts of the likelihood of extinction and 'evolutionary rescue'(7) in montane biodiversity hot spots under climate change scenarios.","Merckx, Vincent S. F.

319,319.0,"Tissue morphogenesis is orchestrated by cell shape changes. Forces required to power these changes are generated by non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) motor proteins pulling filamentous actin (F-actin). Actomyosin networks undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly (pulses)(1,2) to cause cell deformations alternating with steps of stabilization to result in irreversible shape changes(3-6). Although this ratchet-like behaviour operates in a variety of contexts, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigate the role of MyoII regulation through the conserved Rho1-Rok pathway(7) during Drosophila melanogaster germband extension. This morphogenetic process is powered by cell intercalation, which involves the shrinkage of junctions in the dorsal-ventral axis (vertical junctions) followed by junction extension in the anterior-posterior axis(8). While polarized flows of medial-apical MyoII pulses deform vertical junctions, MyoII enrichment on these junctions (planar polarity) stabilizes them(6). We identify two critical properties of MyoII dynamics that underlie stability and pulsatility: exchange kinetics governed by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles of the MyoII regulatory light chain; and advection due to contraction of the motors on F-actin networks. Spatial control over MyoII exchange kinetics establishes two stable regimes of high and low dissociation rates, resulting in MyoII planar polarity. Pulsatility emerges at intermediate dissociation rates, enabling convergent advection of MyoII and its upstream regulators Rho1 GTP, Rok and MyoII phosphatase. Notably, pulsatility is not an outcome of an upstream Rho1 pacemaker. Rather, it is a self-organized system that involves positive and negative biomechanical feedback between MyoII advection and dissociation rates.","Munjal, Akankshi; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Munro, Edwin; Lecuit, Thomas",,"Munjal, A; Philippe, JM; Munro, E; Lecuit, T",,,,,351,,"[Munjal, Akankshi; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Lecuit, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IBDM UMR7288, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Munro, Edwin] Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14603,Article,1476-4687,thomas.lecuit@univ-amu.fr,+,Labex INFORM [ANR-11-LABX-0054]; ANR Archiplast; ERC (Biomecamorph) [323027]; HFSP; Ministere de l'Education nationale; Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC); France-BioImaging/PICsL infrastructure [ANR-10-INSB-04-01],"We thank M.

323,323.0,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase PARKIN (encoded by PARK2) and the protein kinase PINK1 (encoded by PARK6) are mutated in autosomal-recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) and work together in the disposal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy(1-3). PINK1 is stabilized on the outside of depolarized mitochondria and phosphorylates polyubiquitin(4-8) as well as the PARKIN ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain(9,10). These phosphorylation events lead to PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria, and activation by an unknown allosteric mechanism(4-12). Here we present the crystal structure of Pediculus humanus PARKIN in complex with Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (phosphoUb), revealing the molecular basis for PARKIN recruitment and activation. The phosphoUb binding site on PARKIN comprises a conserved phosphate pocket and harbours residues mutated in patients with AR-JP. PhosphoUb binding leads to straightening of a helix in the RING1 domain, and the resulting conformational changes release the Ubl domain from the PARKIN core; this activates PARKIN. Moreover, phosphoUb-mediated Ubl release enhances Ubl phosphorylation by PINK1, leading to conformational changes within the Ubl domain and stabilization of an open, active conformation of PARKIN. We redefine the role of the Ubl domain not only as an inhibitory(13) but also as an activating element that is restrained in inactive PARKIN and released by phosphoUb. Our work opens up new avenues to identify small-molecule PARKIN activators.","Wauer, Tobias; Simicek, Michal; Schubert, Alexander; Komander, David",,"Wauer, T; Simicek, M; Schubert, A; Komander, D",,,,,370,,"[Wauer, Tobias; Simicek, Michal; Schubert, Alexander; Komander, David] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14879,Article,1476-4687,dk@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,+,Medical Research Council [U105192732]; European Research Council [309756]; Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine; EMBO,"We would like to thank M.

324,324.0,"mu-Opioid receptors (mu ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of the mu OR in inactive(1) and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2) provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event, but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien",,"Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",,,,,375,,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

326,326.0,"The source of new hepatocytes in the uninjured liver has remained an open question. By lineage tracing using the Wnt-responsive gene Axin2 in mice, we identify a population of proliferating and self-renewing cells adjacent to the central vein in the liver lobule. These pericentral cells express the early liver progenitor marker Tbx3, are diploid, and thereby differ from mature hepatocytes, which are mostly polyploid. The descendants of pericentral cells differentiate into Tbx3-negative, polyploid hepatocytes, and can replace all hepatocytes along the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal. Adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide Wnt signals that maintain the pericentral cells, thereby constituting the niche. Thus, we identify a cell population in the liver that subserves homeostatic hepatocyte renewal, characterize its anatomical niche, and identify molecular signals that regulate its activity.","Wang, Bruce; Zhao, Ludan; Fish, Matt; Logan, Catriona Y.; Nusse, Roel",,"Wang, B; Zhao, LD; Fish, M; Logan, CY; Nusse, R",,,,,180,,"[Wang, Bruce; Zhao, Ludan; Fish, Matt; Logan, Catriona Y.; Nusse, Roel] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Dev Biol,Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Bruce] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Bruce] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Liver, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14863,Article,1476-4687,bruce.wang@ucsf.edu; rnusse@stanford.edu,+,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Reed-Stinehart foundation;  [F32DK091005],"These studies were supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a grant from the Reed-Stinehart foundation.

328,328.0,"The specifics of how galaxies form from, and are fuelled by, gas from the intergalactic medium remain uncertain. Hydrodynamic simulations suggest that 'cold accretion flows'-relatively cool (temperatures of the order of 104 kelvin), unshocked gas streaming along filaments of the cosmic web into dark-matter halos(1-3)-are important. These flows are thought to deposit gas and angular momentum into the circumgalactic medium, creating disk-or ring-like structures that eventually coalesce into galaxies that form at filamentary intersections(4,5). Recently, a large and luminous filament, consistent with such a cold accretion flow, was discovered near the quasi-stellar object QSO UM287 at redshift 2.279 using narrow-band imaging(6). Unfortunately, imaging is not sufficient to constrain the physical characteristics of the filament, to determine its kinematics, to explain how it is linked to nearby sources, or to account for its unusual brightness, more than a factor of ten above what is expected for a filament. Here we report a two-dimensional spectroscopic investigation of the emitting structure. We find that the brightest emission region is an extended rotating hydrogen disk with a velocity profile that is characteristic of gas in a darkmatter halo with a mass of 10(13) solar masses. This giant protogalactic disk appears to be connected to a quiescent filament that may extend beyond the virial radius of the halo. The geometry is strongly suggestive of a cold accretion flow.","Martin, D. Christopher; Matuszewski, Mateusz; Morrissey, Patrick; Neill, James D.; Moore, Anna; Cantalupo, Sebastiano; Prochaska, J.

333,333.0,"Flat-slab subduction occurs when the descending plate becomes horizontal at some depth before resuming its descent into the mantle. It is often proposed as a mechanism for the uplifting of deep crustal rocks ('thick-skinned' deformation) far from plate boundaries, and for causing unusual patterns of volcanism, as far back as the Proterozoic eon(1). For example, the formation of the expansive Rocky Mountains and the subsequent voluminous volcanism across much of the western USA has been attributed to a broad region of flat-slab subduction beneath North America that occurred during the Laramide orogeny (80-55 million years ago)(2). Here we study the largest modern flat slab, located in Peru, to better understand the processes controlling the formation and extent of flat slabs. We present new data that indicate that the subducting Nazca Ridge is necessary for the development and continued support of the horizontal plate at a depth of about 90 kilometres. By combining constraints from Rayleigh wave phase velocities with improved earthquake locations, we find that the flat slab is shallowest along the ridge, while to the northwest of the ridge, the slab is sagging, tearing, and re-initiating normal subduction. On the basis of our observations, we propose a conceptual model for the temporal evolution of the Peruvian flat slab in which the flat slab forms because of the combined effects of trench retreat along the Peruvian plate boundary, suction, and ridge subduction. We find that while the ridge is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of the flat slab, its removal is sufficient for the flat slab to fail. This provides new constraints on our understanding of the processes controlling the beginning and end of the Laramide orogeny and other putative episodes of flat-slab subduction.","Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Wagner, Lara S.; Kumar, Abhash; Beck, Susan L.; Long, Maureen D.; Zandt, George; Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal",,"Antonijevic, SK; Wagner, LS; Kumar, A; Beck, SL; Long, MD; Zandt, G; Tavera, H; Condori, C",,,,,212,,"[Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Kumar, Abhash] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wagner, Lara S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Beck, Susan L.; Zandt, George] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Long, Maureen D.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal] Inst Geofis Peru, Lima 15012, Peru",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14648,Article,1476-4687,sknezevi@live.unc.edu,+,"NSF [EAR-0944184, EAR-0943991, EAR-0943962, EAR-0908777, EAR-0907880]","We thank R.

336,336.0,"Patterns of amino acid conservation have served as a tool for understanding protein evolution(1). The same principles have also found broad application in human genomics, driven by the need to interpret the pathogenic potential of variants in patients(2). Here we performed a systematic comparative genomics analysis of human disease-causing missense variants. We found that an appreciable fraction of disease-causing alleles are fixed in the genomes of other species, suggesting a role for genomic context. We developed a model of genetic interactions that predicts most of these to be simple pairwise compensations. Functional testing of this model on two known human disease genes(3,4) revealed discrete cis amino acid residues that, although benign on their own, could rescue the human mutations in vivo. This approach was also applied to ab initio gene discovery to support the identification of a de novo disease driver in BTG2 that is subject to protective cis-modification in more than 50 species. Finally, on the basis of our data and models, we developed a computational tool to predict candidate residues subject to compensation. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of cis-genomic context as a contributor to protein evolution; they provide an insight into the complexity of allele effect on phenotype; and they are likely to assist methods for predicting allele pathogenicity(5,6).","Jordan, Daniel M.; Frangakis, Stephan G.; Golzio, Christelle; Cassa, Christopher A.; Kurtzberg, Joanne; Davis, Erica E.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.; Katsanis, Nicholas",,"Jordan, DM; Frangakis, SG; Golzio, C; Cassa, CA; Kurtzberg, J; Davis, EE; Sunyaev, SR; Katsanis, N",,,,,225,,"[Jordan, Daniel M.; Cassa, Christopher A.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jordan, Daniel M.; Cassa, Christopher A.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Frangakis, Stephan G.; Golzio, Christelle; Davis, Erica E.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Kurtzberg, Joanne] Duke Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Pediat Blood & Marrow Transplantat, Durham, NC 27701 USA",Task Force Neonatal Genomics,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14497,Article,1476-4687,ssunyaev@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; nicholas.katsanis@dm.duke.edu,+,NARSAD;  [R01HD04260];  [R01DK072301];  [R01DK075972];  [R01 GM078598];  [R01 MH101244];  [R01 DK095721];  [U01 HG006500];  [R01EY021872],"We thank Y.

How the same machinery can either completely degrade or precisely trim RNA substrates has long remained unexplained. Here we report the crystal structures of a yeast nuclear exosome containing the 9-subunit core, the 3'-5' RNases Rrp44 and Rrp6, and the obligate Rrp6-binding partner Rrp47 in complex with different RNAs. The combined structural and biochemical data of this 12-subunit complex reveal how a single-stranded RNA can reach the Rrp44 or Rrp6 active sites directly or can bind Rrp6 and be threaded via the central channel towards the distal RNase Rrp44. When a bulky RNA is stalled at the entrance of the channel, Rrp6-Rrp47 swings open. The results suggest how the same molecular machine can coordinate processive degradation and partial trimming in an RNA-dependent manner by a concerted swinging mechanism of the two RNase subunits.","Makino, Debora Lika; Schuch, Benjamin; Stegmann, Elisabeth; Baumgaertner, Marc; Basquin, Claire; Conti, Elena",,"Makino, DL; Schuch, B; Stegmann, E; Baumgartner, M; Basquin, C; Conti, E",,,,,54,,"[Makino, Debora Lika; Schuch, Benjamin; Stegmann, Elisabeth; Baumgaertner, Marc; Basquin, Claire; Conti, Elena] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Struct Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14865,Article,1476-4687,conti@biochem.mpg.de,U89,"Max Planck Gesellschaft; European Commission (ERC Advanced Investigator Grant) [294371]; European Commission (Marie Curie ITN RNPnet); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG SFB646, SFB1035, GRK1721, FOR1680]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (CIPSM); Louis Jeantet Foundation","We would like to thank the MPIB Crystallization Facility and MPIB Core Facility; the beamline scientists at SLS beamlines PXII and PXIII and APS beamline 17-ID-B for assistance with data collection; M.

347,347.0,"Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge(1,2). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C-60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy(3) provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer(4,5). This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7).","Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Teobaldi, Gilberto; Deacon, William; Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus; Lee, Steve; Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.; MacLaren, Donald A.; Flokstra, Machiel; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar",,"Al Ma'Mari, F; Moorsom, T; Teobaldi, G; Deacon, W; Prokscha, T; Luetkens, H; Lee, S; Sterbinsky, GE; Arena, DA; MacLaren, DA; Flokstra, M; Ali, M; Wheeler, MC; Burnell, G; Hickey, BJ; Cespedes, O",,,,,69,,"[Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Deacon, William; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar] Univ Leeds, Sch Phys & Astron, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Teobaldi, Gilberto] Univ Liverpool, Stephenson Inst Renewable Energy, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Muon Spin Spect, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Lee, Steve; Flokstra, Machiel] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland; [Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Photon Sci Directorate, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [MacLaren, Donald A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14621,Article,1476-4687,o.cespedes@leeds.ac.uk,U128,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1, EP/I004483/1]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through grants EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1 and EP/I004483/1.

348,348.0,"The prediction and synthesis of new crystal structures enable the targeted preparation of materials with desired properties. Among porous solids, this has been achieved for metal-organic frameworks(1-3), but not for the more widely applicable zeolites(4,5), where new materials are usually discovered using exploratory synthesis. Although millions of hypothetical zeolite structures have been proposed(6,7), not enough is known about their synthesis mechanism to allow any given structure to be prepared. Here we present an approach that combines structure solution with structure prediction, and inspires the targeted synthesis of new super-complex zeolites. We used electron diffraction to identify a family of related structures and to discover the structural 'coding' within them. This allowed us to determine the complex, and previously unknown, structure of zeolite ZSM-25 (ref. 8), which has the largest unit-cell volume of all known zeolites (91,554 cubic angstroms) and demonstrates selective CO2 adsorption. By extending our method, we were able to predict other members of a family of increasingly complex, but structurally related, zeolites and to synthesize two more-complex zeolites in the family, PST-20 and PST-25, with much larger cell volumes (166,988 and 275,178 cubic angstroms, respectively) and similar selective adsorption properties. Members of this family have the same symmetry, but an expanding unit cell, and are related by hitherto unrecognized structural principles; we call these family members embedded isoreticular zeolite structures.","Guo, Peng; Shin, Jiho; Greenaway, Alex G.; Min, Jung Gi; Su, Jie; Choi, Hyun June; Liu, Leifeng; Cox, Paul A.; Hong, Suk Bong; Wright, Paul A.; Zou, Xiaodong",,"Guo, P; Shin, J; Greenaway, AG; Min, JG; Su, J; Choi, HJ; Liu, LF; Cox, PA; Hong, SB; Wright, PA; Zou, XD",,,,,74,,"[Guo, Peng; Su, Jie; Liu, Leifeng; Zou, Xiaodong] Stockholm Univ, Inorgan & Struct Chem, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Guo, Peng; Su, Jie; Liu, Leifeng; Zou, Xiaodong] Stockholm Univ, Berzelii Ctr EXSELENT Porous Mat, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Shin, Jiho; Min, Jung Gi; Choi, Hyun June; Hong, Suk Bong] POSTECH, Ctr Ordered Nanoporous Mat Synth, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Greenaway, Alex G.; Wright, Paul A.] Univ St Andrews, EaStCHEM Sch Chem, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland; [Cox, Paul A.] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Pharm & Biomed Sci, Portsmouth PO1 2DT, Hants, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14575,Article,1476-4687,sbhong@postech.ac.kr; paw2@st-andrews.ac.uk; xzou@mmk.su.se,U143,Swedish Research Council (VR); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA); Rontgen-Angstrom Cluster through the project grant MATsynCELL; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the project grant 3DEM-NATUR; NCRI [2012R1A3A-2048833]; BK 21-plus programmes through the National Research Foundation of Korea; UK EPSRC [EP/J02077X/1]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,"We acknowledge financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VR), the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA), the Rontgen-Angstrom Cluster through the project grant MATsynCELL, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the project grant 3DEM-NATUR, the NCRI (2012R1A3A-2048833) and BK 21-plus programmes through the National Research Foundation of Korea, and the UK EPSRC (EP/J02077X/1).

350,350.0,"Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere(1-3). Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.","Hilton, Robert G.; Galy, Valier; Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bryant, Charlotte; O'Regan, Matt; Groecke, Darren R.; Coxall, Helen; Bouchez, Julien; Calmels, Damien",,"Hilton, RG; Galy, V; Gaillardet, J; Dellinger, M; Bryant, C; O'Regan, M; Grocke, DR; Coxall, H; Bouchez, J; Calmels, D",,,,,84,,"[Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Galy, Valier] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bouchez, Julien] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bryant, Charlotte] NERC Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 OQF, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Regan, Matt; Coxall, Helen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groecke, Darren R.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Calmels, Damien] Univ Paris 11, Lab GEOPS, UMR CNRS 8148, F-91405 Orsay, France",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14653,Article,1476-4687,r.g.hilton@durham.ac.uk,U162,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK [1611.0312]; CNRS (OXYMORE); CNRS (CANNIBALT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Arctic Research Initiative; Early Career Research Grant by the British Society for Geomorphology; US National Science Foundation [OCE-0928582]; Royal Society University Fellowship","Radiocarbon measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK (Allocation 1611.0312) to R.G.H and C.B.

353,353.0,"West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded(1-3). Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.","Carroll, Miles W.; Matthews, David A.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Elmore, Michael J.; Pollakis, Georgios; Rambaut, Andrew; Hewson, Roger; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Bore, Joseph Akoi; Koundouno, Raymond; Abdellati, Said; Afrough, Babak; Aiyepada, John; Akhilomen, Patience; Asogun, Danny; Atkinson, Barry; Badusche, Marlis; Bah, Amadou; Bate, Simon; Baumann, Jan; Becker, Dirk; Becker-Ziaja, Beate; Bocquin, Anne; Borremans, Benny; Bosworth, Andrew; Boettcher, Jan Peter; Cannas, Angela; Carletti, Fabrizio; Castilletti, Concetta; Clark, Simon; Colavita, Francesca; Diederich, Sandra; Donatus, Adomeh; Duraffour, Sophie; Ehichioya, Deborah; Ellerbrok, Heinz; Fernandez-Garcia, Maria Dolores; Fizet, Alexandra; Fleischmann, Erna; Gryseels, Sophie; Hermelink, Antje; Hinzmann, Julia; Hopf-Guevara, Ute; Ighodalo, Yemisi; Jameson, Lisa; Kelterbaum, Anne; Kis, Zoltan; Kloth, Stefan; Kohl, Claudia; Korva, Misa; Kraus, Annette; Kuisma, Eeva; Kurth, Andreas; Liedigk, Britta; Logue, Christopher H.; Luedtke, Anja; Maes, Piet; McCowen, James; Mely, Stephane; Mertens, Marc; Meschi, Silvia; Meyer, Benjamin; Michel, Janine; Molkenthin, Peter; Munoz-Fontela, Cesar; Muth, Doreen; Newman, Edmund N.

EMLab worked with WHO, MSF and the Guinean authorities to tackle the outbreak in the Gueckedou area where the samples from this study were collected. We thank those who helped make this possible and the Guinean authorities for their decision to release the diagnostic samples to EMLab for shipment to Europe to undergo further analysis, including sequencing. We acknowledge Air France, Brussels Airlines and Virgin Airlines for transporting EMLab personnel and equipment in and out of West Africa during the outbreak period; World Courier for shipping our EBOV-positive samples out of Guinea to Europe; and the logistics support units and pilots and drivers of WHO/United Nations in West Africa for transporting our people and equipment throughout the region, and especially the drivers who made the 28h round trip journey from Conakry to enable the EMLab unit to be established and resupplied in Gueckedou. We appreciate the work of the numerous European Embassies operating in West Africa who provided emergency support to our personnel at times of need. We thank M. Bull, J. Lewis, P. Payne and S. Leach from the Microbial Risk Assessment and Behavioural Science Team, Emergency Response Department, Public Health England; J. Tree from Public Health England for help with GenBank submission; and S. Price and I. Stewart for helping with the running of our software on BlueCrystal, University of Bristol. We thank the people of West Africa for their gratitude and optimism, and for their positive attitude to our presence that we encountered on the daily journey to the Ebola Treatment Centre in Gueckedou. We acknowledge the efforts of the late Dr Lamine Ouendeno, who was one of the first healthcare workers to die during the current EBVD outbreak.

355,355.0,"Ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms are collectively responsible for the aerobic oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate and have essential roles in the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. The physiology of nitrifiers has been intensively studied, and urea and ammonia are the only recognized energy sources that promote the aerobic growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. Here we report the aerobic growth of a pure culture of the ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeote Nitrososphaera gargensis(1) using cyanate as the sole source of energy and reductant; to our knowledge, the first organism known to do so. Cyanate, a potentially important source of reduced nitrogen in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems(2), is converted to ammonium and carbon dioxide in Nitrososphaera gargensis by a cyanase enzyme that is induced upon addition of this compound. Within the cyanase gene family, this cyanase is a member of a distinct clade also containing cyanases of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira. We demonstrate by co-culture experiments that these nitrite oxidizers supply cyanase-lacking ammonia oxidizers with ammonium from cyanate, which is fully nitrified by this microbial consortium through reciprocal feeding. By screening a comprehensive set of more than 3,000 publically available metagenomes from environmental samples, we reveal that cyanase-encoding genes clustering with the cyanases of these nitrifiers are widespread in the environment. Our results demonstrate an unexpected metabolic versatility of nitri-fying microorganisms, and suggest a previously unrecognized importance of cyanate in cycling of nitrogen compounds in the environment.","Palatinszky, Marton; Herbold, Craig; Jehmlich, Nico; Pogoda, Mario; Han, Ping; von Bergen, Martin; Lagkouvardos, Ilias; Karst, Soren M.; Galushko, Alexander; Koch, Hanna; Berry, David; Daims, Holger; Wagner, Michael",,"Palatinszky, M; Herbold, C; Jehmlich, N; Pogoda, M; Han, P; von Bergen, M; Lagkouvardos, I; Karst, SM; Galushko, A; Koch, H; Berry, D; Daims, H; Wagner, M",,,,,105,,"[Palatinszky, Marton; Herbold, Craig; Pogoda, Mario; Han, Ping; Lagkouvardos, Ilias; Galushko, Alexander; Koch, Hanna; Berry, David; Daims, Holger; Wagner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Div Microbial Ecol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Jehmlich, Nico; von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Prote, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Metabol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin; Karst, Soren M.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Fac Engn & Sci, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Lagkouvardos, Ilias] Tech Univ Munich, ZIEL Res Ctr Nutr & Food Sci, Gregor Mendel Str 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Galushko, Alexander] Agrophys Res Inst, 14 Grazhdanskiy Pr, St Petersburg 195220, Russia",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14856,Article,1476-4687,wagner@microbial-ecology.net,+,"European Research Council [294343]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P25231-B21, P26127-B20]; European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association; Collaborative Research Centre AquaDiva of the German Research Foundation","We thank E.

365,365.0,"Dielectric materials, which store energy electrostatically, are ubiquitous in advanced electronics and electric power systems(1-8). Compared to their ceramic counterparts, polymer dielectrics have higher breakdown strengths and greater reliability(1-3,9), are scalable, lightweight and can be shaped into intricate configurations, and are therefore an ideal choice for many power electronics, power conditioning, and pulsed power applications(1,9,10). However, polymer dielectrics are limited to relatively low working temperatures, and thus fail to meet the rising demand for electricity under the extreme conditions present in applications such as hybrid and electric vehicles, aerospace power electronics, and underground oil and gas exploration(11-13). Here we describe crosslinked polymer nanocomposites that contain boron nitride nanosheets, the dielectric properties of which are stable over a broad temperature and frequency range. The nanocomposites have outstanding high-voltage capacitive energy storage capabilities at record temperatures (a Weibull breakdown strength of 403 megavolts per metre and a discharged energy density of 1.8 joules per cubic centimetre at 250 degrees Celsius). Their electrical conduction is several orders of magnitude lower than that of existing polymers and their high operating temperatures are attributed to greatly improved thermal conductivity, owing to the presence of the boron nitride nanosheets, which improve heat dissipation compared to pristine polymers (which are inherently susceptible to thermal runaway). Moreover, the polymer nanocomposites are lightweight, photopatternable and mechanically flexible, and have been demonstrated to preserve excellent dielectric and capacitive performance after intensive bending cycles. These findings enable broader applications of organic materials in high-temperature electronics and energy storage devices.","Li, Qi; Chen, Lei; Gadinski, Matthew R.; Zhang, Shihai; Zhang, Guangzu; Li, Haoyu; Haque, Aman; Chen, Long-Qing; Jackson, Thomas N.; Wang, Qing",,"Li, Q; Chen, L; Gadinski, MR; Zhang, SH; Zhang, GZ; Li, HY; Haque, A; Chen, LQ; Jackson, TN; Wang, Q",,,,,576,,"[Li, Qi; Chen, Lei; Gadinski, Matthew R.; Zhang, Guangzu; Chen, Long-Qing; Wang, Qing] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Shihai] PolyK Technol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Li, Haoyu; Jackson, Thomas N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Haque, Aman] Penn State Univ, Dept Mech & Nucl Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14647,Article,1476-4687,wang@matse.psu.edu,+,US Office of Naval Research [N00014-11-1-0342]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0264]; Dow Chemical Corporation,Q.W. acknowledges financial support from the US Office of Naval Research under grant number N00014-11-1-0342.

368,368.0,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most frequently encountered forms ofmental illness and a leading cause of disability worldwide(1), poses a major challenge to genetic analysis. To date, no robustly replicated genetic loci have been identified(2), despite analysis of more than 9,000 cases(3). Here, using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 5,303 Chinese women with recurrent MDD selected to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity, and 5,337 controls screened to exclude MDD, we identified, and subsequently replicated in an independent sample, two loci contributing to risk of MDD on chromosome 10: one near the SIRT1 gene (P = 2.53 x 10(-10)), the other in an intron of the LHPP gene (P = 6.45 x10(-12)). Analysis of 4,509 cases with a severe subtype of MDD, melancholia, yielded an increased genetic signal at the SIRT1 locus. We attribute our success to the recruitment of relatively homogeneous cases with severe illness.","Cai, Na; Bigdeli, Tim B.; Kretzschmar, Warren; Li, Yihan; Liang, Jieqin; Song, Li; Hu, Jingchu; Li, Qibin;

371,371.0,"Atmospheric methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, and is responsible for about 20% of the global warming effect since pre-industrial times(1,2). Rice paddies are the largest anthropogenic methane source and produce 7-17% of atmospheric methane(2,3). Warm waterlogged soil and exuded nutrients from rice roots provide ideal conditions for methanogenesis in paddies with annual methane emissions of 25-100-million tonnes(3,4). This scenario will be exacerbated by an expansion in rice cultivation needed to meet the escalating demand for food in the coming decades(4). There is an urgent need to establish sustainable technologies for increasing rice production while reducing methane fluxes from rice paddies. However, ongoing efforts for methane mitigation in rice paddies are mainly based on farming practices and measures that are difficult to implement(5). Despite proposed strategies to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions(4,6), no high-starch low-methane-emission rice has been developed. Here we show that the addition of a single transcription factor gene, barley SUSIBA2 (refs 7, 8), conferred a shift of carbon flux to SUSIBA2 rice, favouring the allocation of photo-synthates to aboveground biomass over allocation to roots. The altered allocation resulted in an increased biomass and starch content in the seeds and stems, and suppressed methanogenesis, possibly through a reduction in root exudates. Three-year field trials in China demonstrated that the cultivation of SUSIBA2 rice was associated with a significant reduction in methane emissions and a decrease in rhizospheric methanogen levels. SUSIBA2 rice offers a sustainable means of providing increased starch content for food production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation. Approaches to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions as seen in SUSIBA2 rice may be particularly beneficial in a future climate with rising temperatures resulting in increased methane emissions from paddies(9,10).","Su, J.; Hu, C.; Yan, X.; Jin, Y.; Chen, Z.; Guan, Q.; Wang, Y.; Zhong, D.; Jansson, C.; Wang, F.; Schnurer, A.; Sun, C.",,"Su, J; Hu, C; Yan, X; Jin, Y; Chen, Z; Guan, Q; Wang, Y; Zhong, D; Jansson, C; Wang, F; Schnurer, A; Sun, C",,,,,602,,"[Su, J.; Hu, C.; Chen, Z.; Guan, Q.; Wang, Y.; Zhong, D.; Wang, F.] Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Inst Biotechnol, Fuzhou 350003, Peoples R China; [Su, J.; Hu, C.; Yan, X.; Jin, Y.; Sun, C.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Linnean Ctr Plant Biol, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Plant Biol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Jin, Y.] Hunan Agr Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Crop Germplasm Innovat & Utili, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jansson, C.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Environm Mol Sci Lab EMSL, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Schnurer, A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Microbiol, Uppsala BioCtr, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14673,Article,1476-4687,wf@fjage.org; Chuanxin.Sun@slu.se,+,"Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) [219-2014-1172]; Formas/Sida [220-2009-2069]; SLU Larosatesansokan Programme (TC4F) for Team 4 - Vinnova; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) under the Strategic Research Area for the TCBB Programme; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30771298, 31370389]; SLU programme BarleyFunFood; Carl Trygger Foundation [CTS 11: 450]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Special thanks to S.

380,380.0,"It was suggested(1) more than thirty years ago that Watson-Crick base pairing might be used for the rational design of nanometre-scale structures from nucleic acids. Since then, and especially since the introduction of the origami technique(2), DNA nanotechnology has enabled increasingly more complex structures(3-18). But although general approaches for creating DNA origami polygonal meshes and design software are available(14,16,17,19-21), there are still important constraints arising from DNA geometry and sense/antisense pairing, necessitating some manual adjustment during the design process. Here we present a general method of folding arbitrary polygonal digital meshes in DNA that readily produces structures that would be very difficult to realize using previous approaches. The design process is highly automated, using a routeing algorithm based on graph theory and a relaxation simulation that traces scaffold strands through the target structures. Moreover, unlike conventional origami designs built from close-packed helices, our structures have a more open conformation with one helix per edge and are therefore stable under the ionic conditions usually used in biological assays.","Benson, Erik; Mohammed, Abdulmelik; Gardell, Johan; Masich, Sergej; Czeizler, Eugen; Orponen, Pekka; Hogberg, Bjorn",,"Benson, E; Mohammed, A; Gardell, J; Masich, S; Czeizler, E; Orponen, P; Hogberg, B",,,,,441,,"[Benson, Erik; Gardell, Johan; Hogberg, Bjorn] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Benson, Erik; Gardell, Johan; Hogberg, Bjorn] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Mohammed, Abdulmelik; Czeizler, Eugen; Orponen, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Masich, Sergej] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14586,Article,1476-4687,bjorn.hogberg@ki.se,U139,"Swedish Research Council [2010-5060, 2013-5883]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research [FFL12-0219]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation [KAW2014.0241]; Wallenberg Scholars grant; Helsinki Doctoral Education Network on Information and Communications Technology","This work was funded through grants from the Swedish Research Council (grants 2010-5060 and 2013-5883 to B.H.), the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (grant FFL12-0219 to B.H.) and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation (Academy Fellow grant KAW2014.0241 to B.H.).

383,383.0,"Kennewick Man, referred to as the Ancient One by Native Americans, is a male human skeleton discovered in Washington state (USA) in 1996 and initially radiocarbon dated to 8,340-9,200 calibrated years before present (BP)(1). His population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted(2). Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans(2). In order to resolve Kennewick Man's ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to similar to 1x coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man. We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genome-wide comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans over at least the last eight millennia.","Rasmussen, Morten; Sikora, Martin; Albrechtsen, Anders; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand; Moreno-Mayar, J.

388,388.0,"Recent studies into the global causes of severe diarrhoea in young children have identified the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium as the second most important diarrhoeal pathogen after rotavirus(1-3). Diarrhoeal disease is estimated to be responsible for 10.5% of overall child mortality(4). Cryptosporidium is also an opportunistic pathogen in the contexts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-caused AIDS and organ transplantation(5,6). There is no vaccine and only a single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger: malnourished children and immunocompromised patients(7,8). Cryptosporidiosisdrug and vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which includes a lack of systems for continuous culture, facile animal models, and molecular genetic tools(3,9). Here we describe an experimental framework to genetically modify this important human pathogen. We established and optimized transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable transgenics we developed a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into the intestine, aCryptosporidium clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside resistance. We derived reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug screening, and we evaluated the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knockout. We anticipate that the ability to genetically engineer this parasite will be transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection, and the role of parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation.","Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris",,"Vinayak, S; Pawlowic, MC; Sateriale, A; Brooks, CF; Studstill, CJ; Bar-Peled, Y; Cipriano, MJ; Striepen, B",,,,,477,,"[Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14651,Article,1476-4687,striepen@uga.edu,U232,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI112427]; Centers for Disease Control; University of Georgia Research Foundation;  [NIH T32AI060546],"We thank L.

398,398.0,"Gram-negative bacteria inhabit a broad range of ecological niches. For Escherichia coli, this includes river water as well as humans and animals, where it can be both a commensal and a pathogen(1-3). Intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure that bacteria have the right complement of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to enable adaptation to a particular habitat(4,5). Yet no mechanism is known for replacing OMPs in the outer membrane, an issue that is further confounded by the lack of an energy source and the high stability(6) and abundance of OMPs(5). Here we uncover the process underpinning OMP turnover in Escherichia coli and show it to be passive and binary in nature, in which old OMPs are displaced to the poles of growing cells as new OMPs take their place. Using fluorescent colicins as OMP-specific probes, in combination with ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo and in vitro, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, we established the mechanism for binary OMP partitioning. OMPs clustered to form 0.5-mu m diameter islands, where their diffusion is restricted by promiscuous interactions with other OMPs. OMP islands were distributed throughout the cell and contained the Bam complex, which catalyses the insertion of OMPs in the outer membrane(7,8). However, OMP biogenesis occurred as a gradient that was highest at mid-cell but largely absent at cell poles. The cumulative effect is to push old OMP islands towards the poles of growing cells, leading to a binary distribution when cells divide. Hence, the outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium is a spatially and temporally organized structure, and this organization lies at the heart of how OMPs are turned over in the membrane.","Rassam, Patrice; Copeland, Nikki A.; Birkholz, Oliver; Toth, Csaba; Chavent, Matthieu; Duncan, Anna L.; Cross, Stephen J.; Housden, Nicholas G.; Kaminska, Renata; Seger, Urban; Quinn, Diana M.; Garrod, Tamsin J.; Sansom, Mark S.

399,399.0,"One of the characteristics of the central nervous system is the lack of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment(1-3), the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood(4-6). In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.","Louveau, Antoine; Smirnov, Igor; Keyes, Timothy J.; Eccles, Jacob D.; Rouhani, Sherin J.; Peske, J.

400,400.0,"Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress(1,2). Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle(3), the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P(1) suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P(1) signalling in vivo(4). Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis5, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P(1) signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.","Blaho, Victoria A.; Galvani, Sylvain; Engelbrecht, Eric; Liu, Catherine; Swendeman, Steven L.; Kono, Mari; Proia, Richard L.; Steinman, Lawrence; Han, May H.; Hla, Timothy",,"Blaho, VA; Galvani, S; Engelbrecht, E; Liu, C; Swendeman, SL; Kono, M; Proia, RL; Steinman, L; Han, MH; Hla, T",,,,,342,,"[Blaho, Victoria A.; Galvani, Sylvain; Engelbrecht, Eric; Liu, Catherine; Swendeman, Steven L.; Hla, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Ctr Vasc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Blaho, Victoria A.; Hla, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Brain & Mind Res Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kono, Mari; Proia, Richard L.] NIDDK, Genet Dev & Dis Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Steinman, Lawrence; Han, May H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14462,Article,1476-4687,tih2002@med.cornell.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32 CA14211]; New York Stem Cell Foundation [C026878]; NIH, Fondation Leducq [HL67330, HL70694, HL89934]; Intramural program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH; Fondation Leducq; Lipidomics Shared Resource, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina [P30 CA138313]; Lipidomics Core in the SC Lipidomics and Pathobiology COBRE [P20 RR017677]","The authors thank C.

403,403.0,"During bacterial growth, a cell approximately doubles in size before division, after which it splits into two daughter cells. This process is subjected to the inherent perturbations of cellular noise(1,2) and thus requires regulation for cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying the control and dynamics of cell size remain poorly understood owing to the difficulty in sizing individual bacteria over long periods of time in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure and analyse long-term, single-cell growth and division across different Escherichia coli strains and growth conditions(3). We show that a subset of cells in a population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals that a simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear map-explains the origins of these cell-size oscillations across all strains. This noisy linear map implements a negative feedback on cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends to divide earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later. Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental data, we demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient oscillations, not just in cell size, but also in constitutive gene expression. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of bacterial cell-size regulation with implications for the physiological processes involved.","Tanouchi, Yu; Pai, Anand; Park, Heungwon; Huang, Shuqiang; Stamatov, Rumen; Buchler, Nicolas E.; You, Lingchong",,"Tanouchi, Y; Pai, A; Park, H; Huang, SQ; Stamatov, R; Buchler, NE; You, LC",,,,,357,,"[Tanouchi, Yu; Pai, Anand; Huang, Shuqiang; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Park, Heungwon; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Park, Heungwon; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stamatov, Rumen] Duke Univ, Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Buchler, Nicolas E.; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14562,Article,1476-4687,you@duke.edu,+,"National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01GM098642, R01GM110494]; DuPont Young Professorship; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; DARPA Biochronicity Grant [DARPA-BAA-11-66]; NIH [DP2 OD008654-01]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund [BWF 1005769.01]","We thank S.

405,405.0,"Retroviral integration is catalysed by a tetramer of integrase (IN) assembled on viral DNA ends in a stable complex, known as the intasome(1,2). How the intasome interfaces with chromosomal DNA, which exists in the form of nucleosomal arrays, is currently unknown. Here we show that the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome is proficient at stable capture of nucleosomes as targets for integration. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals a multivalent intasome-nucleosome interface involving both gyres of nucleosomal DNA and one H2A-H2B heterodimer. While the histone octamer remains intact, the DNA is lifted from the surface of the H2A-H2B heterodimer to allow integration at strongly preferred superhelix location +/- 3.5 positions. Amino acid substitutions disrupting these contacts impinge on the ability of the intasome to engage nucleosomes in vitro and redistribute viral integration sites on the genomic scale. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis for nucleosome capture by the viral DNA recombination machinery and the underlying nucleosome plasticity that allows integration.","Maskell, Daniel P.; Renault, Ludovic; Serrao, Erik; Lesbats, Paul; Matadeen, Rishi; Hare, Stephen; Lindemann, Dirk; Engelman, Alan N.; Costa, Alessandro; Cherepanov, Peter",,"Maskell, DP; Renault, L; Serrao, E; Lesbats, P; Matadeen, R; Hare, S; Lindemann, D; Engelman, AN; Costa, A; Cherepanov, P",,,,,366,,"[Maskell, Daniel P.; Lesbats, Paul; Cherepanov, Peter] Francis Crick Inst, Chromatin Struct & Mobile DNA, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic; Costa, Alessandro] Francis Crick Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Architecture & Dynam Macromol Machines, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic] Natl Inst Biol Stand & Control Microscopy & Imagi, S Mimms EN6 3QG, Herts, England; [Serrao, Erik; Engelman, Alan N.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Matadeen, Rishi] Gorlaeus Lab, NeCEN, NL-2333 Leiden, Netherlands; [Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Lindemann, Dirk] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Virol, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14495,Article,1476-4687,alessandro.costa@crick.ac.uk; peter.cherepanov@crick.ac.uk,+,European Union [305137]; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM082251-06]; US National Institutes of Health [AI070042-08]; Netherlands Centre for Electron Nanoscopy (NeCEN); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [175.010.2009.001]; European Union's Regional Development Fund through 'Kansen voor West' [21Z.014],"This work was supported by the European Union FP7 HIVINNOV consortium grant 305137 (to P.C.), the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences P50 grant GM082251-06 (to P.C.) and the US National Institutes of Health R01 grant AI070042-08 (to A.N.E.).

411,411.0,"Hydrothermal venting along mid-ocean ridges exerts an important control on the chemical composition of sea water by serving as a major source or sink for a number of trace elements in the ocean(1-3). Of these, iron has received considerable attention because of its role as an essential and often limiting nutrient for primary production in regions of the ocean that are of critical importance for the global carbon cycle(4). It has been thought that most of the dissolved iron discharged by hydrothermal vents is lost from solution close to ridge-axis sources(2,5) and is thus of limited importance for ocean biogeochemistry(6). This long-standing view is challenged by recent studies which suggest that stabilization of hydrothermal dissolved iron may facilitate its longrange oceanic transport(7-10). Such transport has been subsequently inferred from spatially limited oceanographic observations(11-13). Here we report data from the US GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) that demonstrate lateral transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron, manganese, and aluminium from the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR) several thousand kilometres westward across the South Pacific Ocean. Dissolved iron exhibits nearly conservative (that is, no loss from solution during transport and mixing) behaviour in this hydrothermal plume, implying a greater longevity in the deep ocean than previously assumed(6,14). Based on our observations, we estimate a global hydrothermal dissolved iron input of three to four gigamoles per year to the ocean interior, which is more than fourfold higher than previous estimates(7,11,14). Complementary simulations with a global-scale ocean biogeochemical model suggest that the observed transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron requires some means of physicochemical stabilization and indicate that hydrothermally derived iron sustains a large fraction of Southern Ocean export production.","Resing, Joseph A.; Sedwick, Peter N.; German, Christopher R.; Jenkins, William J.; Moffett, James W.; Sohst, Bettina M.; Tagliabue, Alessandro",,"Resing, JA; Sedwick, PN; German, CR; Jenkins, WJ; Moffett, JW; Sohst, BM; Tagliabue, A",,,,,200,,"[Resing, Joseph A.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Resing, Joseph A.] NOAA, PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Sedwick, Peter N.; Sohst, Bettina M.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [German, Christopher R.; Jenkins, William J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Moffett, James W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Tagliabue, Alessandro] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14577,Article,1476-4687,resing@uw.edu; a.tagliabue@liverpool.ac.uk,U140,"US National Science Foundation [OCE-1237011, OCE-1237034, OCE-1232991, OCE-1130870, OCE-1131731, OCE-1260273]; N8 consortium; EPSRC [EP/K000225/1]; Humboldt Research Award; JISAO by the PMEL-Earth Oceans Interactions programme","We thank the captain and crew of the RV Thomas G.

423,423.0,"Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized intra-cluster medium. Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks(1), while residual transonic (near-sonic) flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades(2,3). Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium(4) and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action(5-8). However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation(3,9). The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology(10-13), while its structure, consistent with current data(14-18), encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.","Miniati, Francesco; Beresnyak, Andrey",,"Miniati, F; Beresnyak, A",,,,,59,,"[Miniati, Francesco] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beresnyak, Andrey] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Nordita, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beresnyak, Andrey] Stockholm Univ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14552,Article,1476-4687,fm@phys.ethz.ch,+,"Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) [S419, S506]",This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) under project IDs S419 and S506.,CL7RN,,,,,LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; SEED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; TURBULENT MOTIONS; ROTATION MEASURES; POWER SPECTRUM; ADAPTIVE MESH; SHOCK-WAVES; REFINEMENT; GENERATION; STATISTICS,7558.0,NATURE,Nature,English,,36.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Jul,7.0,LONDON,26135447.0,,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Miniati, F (reprint author), ETH, Dept Phys, Wolfgang Pauli Str 27, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,0028-0836,NATURE,,,18.0,Self-similar energetics in large clusters of galaxies,2.0,19.0,WOS:000357169500030,523,Multidisciplinary Sciences,18,andrey,beresnyak,1503,147,male,0.99,RTuSgmUAAAAJ,na,0
426,426.0,"The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the major source of variability in winter atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, with large impacts on temperature, precipitation and storm tracks(1), and therefore also on strategic sectors such as insurance(2), renewable energy production(3), crop yields(4) and water management(5). Recent developments in dynamical methods offer promise to improve seasonal NAO predictions(6), but assessing potential predictability on multi-annual timescales requires documentation of past low-frequency variability in the NAO. A recent bi-proxy NAO reconstruction(7) spanning the past millennium suggested that long-lasting positive NAO conditions were established during medieval times, explaining the particularly warm conditions in Europe during this period; however, these conclusions are debated. Here, we present a yearly NAO reconstruction for the past millennium, based on an initial selection of 48 annually resolved proxy records distributed around the Atlantic Ocean and built through an ensemble of multivariate regressions. We validate the approach in six past-millenniumclimate simulations, and show that our reconstruction outperforms the bi-proxy index. The final reconstruction shows no persistent positive NAO during the medieval period, but suggests that positive phases were dominant during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The reconstruction also reveals that a positive NAO emerges two years after strong volcanic eruptions, consistent with results obtained from models and satellite observations for the Mt Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines(8,9).","Ortega, Pablo; Lehner, Flavio; Swingedouw, Didier; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Raible, Christoph C.; Casado, Mathieu; Yiou, Pascal",,"Ortega, P; Lehner, F; Swingedouw, D; Masson-Delmotte, V; Raible, CC; Casado, M; Yiou, P",,,,,71,,"[Ortega, Pablo; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Casado, Mathieu; Yiou, Pascal] CEA Saclay, UMR CEA CNRS UVSQ 8212, LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lehner, Flavio; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Lehner, Flavio; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux 1, EPOC, F-33615 Pessac, France",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14518,Article,1476-4687,pablo.ortega@lsce.ipsl.fr,+,French ANR CEPS project Green Greenland [ANR-10-CEPL-0008]; NCCR-Climate - Swiss National Science Foundation [200020 147174]; Swedish Research Council [C0629701],"The work of P.O., D.S., V.M.-D. and M.C. has been financially supported by the French ANR CEPS project Green Greenland (ANR-10-CEPL-0008).

These disparate phyla are united by their means of moulting, but otherwise share few morphological characters-none of which has a meaningful fossilization potential.

We document an elongate head with a pair of simple eyes, a terminal buccal chamber containing a radial array of sclerotized elements, and a differentiated foregut that is lined with acicular teeth. The radial elements and pharyngeal teeth resemble the sclerotized circumoral elements and pharyngeal teeth expressed in tardigrades(7-9), stem-group euarthropods(10-12) and cycloneuralian worms(13).

428,428.0,"Sex determination in animals is amazingly plastic. Vertebrates display contrasting strategies ranging from complete genetic control of sex (genotypic sex determination) to environmentally determined sex (for example, temperature-dependent sex determination)(1). Phylogenetic analyses suggest frequent evolutionary transitions between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination in environmentally sensitive lineages, including reptiles(2). These transitions are thought to involve a genotypic system becoming sensitive to temperature, with sex determined by gene-environment interactions(3). Most mechanistic models of transitions invoke a role for sex reversal(3-5). Sex reversal has not yet been demonstrated in nature for any amniote, although it occurs in fish(6) and rarely in amphibians(7,8). Here we make the first report of reptile sex reversal in the wild, in the Australian bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and use sex-reversed animals to experimentally induce a rapid transition from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination. Controlled mating of normal males to sex-reversed females produces viable and fertile offspring whose phenotypic sex is determined solely by temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination). The W sex chromosome is eliminated from this lineage in the first generation. The instantaneous creation of a lineage of ZZ temperature-sensitive animals reveals a novel, climate-induced pathway for the rapid transition between genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination, and adds to concern about adaptation to rapid global climate change.","Holleley, Clare E.; O'Meally, Denis; Sarre, Stephen D.; Graves, Jennifer A.

429,429.0,"Synapse formation is a process tightly controlled in space and time. How gene regulatory mechanisms specify spatial and temporal aspects of synapse formation is not well understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two subtypes of the D-type inhibitory motor neuron (MN) classes, the dorsal D (DD) and ventral D (VD) neurons, extend axons along both the dorsal and ventral nerve cords(1). The embryonically generated DD motor neurons initially innervate ventral muscles in the first (L1) larval stage and receive their synaptic input from cholinergic motor neurons in the dorsal cord. They rewire by the end of the L1 moult to innervate dorsal muscles and to be innervated by newly formed ventral cholinergic motor neurons(1). VD motor neurons develop after the L1 moult; they take over the innervation of ventral muscles and receive their synaptic input from dorsal cholinergic motor neurons. We show here that the spatiotemporal control of synaptic wiring of the D-type neurons is controlled by an intersectional transcriptional strategy in which the UNC-30 Pitx-type homeodomain transcription factor acts together, in embryonic and early larval stages, with the temporally controlled LIN-14 transcription factor to prevent premature synapse rewiring of the DD motor neurons and, together with the UNC-55 nuclear hormone receptor, to prevent aberrant VD synaptic wiring in later larval and adult stages. A key effector of this intersectional transcription factor combination is a novel synaptic organizer molecule, the single immunoglobulin domain protein OIG-1. OIG-1 is perisynaptically localized along the synaptic outputs of the D-type motor neurons in a temporally controlled manner and is required for appropriate selection of both pre-and post-synaptic partners.","Howell, Kelly; White, John G.; Hobert, Oliver",,"Howell, K; White, JG; Hobert, O",,,,,83,,"[Howell, Kelly; Hobert, Oliver] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [White, John G.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14545,Article,1476-4687,kh2512@columbia.edu; or38@columbia.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [R01NS039996-05, R01NS050266-03]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; UK Medical Research Council","We thank the TransgeneOme project, the CGC, J.

430,430.0,"Cells sense the context in which they grow to adapt their phenotype and allow multicellular patterning by mechanisms of autocrine and paracrine signalling(1,2). However, patterns also form in cell populations exposed to the same signalling molecules and substratum, which often correlate with specific features of the population context of single cells, such as local cell crowding(3). Here we reveal a cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism that allows multicellular patterning without requiring specific communication between cells. It acts by sensing the local crowding of a single cell through its ability to spread and activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2), resulting in adaptation of genes controlling membrane homeostasis. In cells experiencing low crowding, FAK suppresses transcription of the ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) by inhibiting FOXO3 and TAL1. Agent-based computational modelling and experimental confirmation identified membrane-based signalling and feedback control as crucial for the emergence of population patterns of ABCA1 expression, which adapts membrane lipid composition to cell crowding and affects multiple signalling activities, including the suppression of ABCA1 expression itself. The simple design of this cell-intrinsic system and its broad impact on the signalling state of mammalian single cells suggests a fundamental role for a tunable membrane lipid composition in collective cell behaviour.","Frechin, Mathieu; Stoeger, Thomas; Daetwyler, Stephan; Gehin, Charlotte; Battich, Nico; Damm, Eva-Maria; Stergiou, Lilli; Riezman, Howard; Pelkmans, Lucas",,"Frechin, M; Stoeger, T; Daetwyler, S; Gehin, C; Battich, N; Damm, EM; Stergiou, L; Riezman, H; Pelkmans, L",,,,,88,,"[Frechin, Mathieu; Stoeger, Thomas; Daetwyler, Stephan; Battich, Nico; Pelkmans, Lucas] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stoeger, Thomas; Battich, Nico] ETH, Life Sci Zurich Grad Sch, PhD Program Syst Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stoeger, Thomas; Battich, Nico] Univ Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gehin, Charlotte; Riezman, Howard] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Damm, Eva-Maria; Stergiou, Lilli] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14429,Article,1476-4687,lucas.pelkmans@imls.uzh.ch,+,EMBO; Marie Curie fellowship [301650]; Oncosuisse fellowship; Bonizzi Theler fellowship; University of Zurich; SystemsX.ch RTD Project LipidX,"We thank B.

431,431.0,"The tumour microenvironment may contribute to tumorigenesis owing to mechanical forces such as fibrotic stiffness or mechanical pressure caused by the expansion of hyper-proliferative cells(1,2). Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, which is associated with increased Ret and beta-catenin signalling. We thus developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes, stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of 1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of beta-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens junctions, and which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation after 15 days. As a consequence, increased expression of beta-catenin-target genes was observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic beta-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.","Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Brulle, Laura; Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas; Rio-Frio, Thomas; Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane; Housset, Chantal; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael; Menager, Christine; Fre, Silvia; Robine, Sylvie; Farge, Emmanuel",,"Fernandez-Sanchez, ME; Barbier, S; Whitehead, J; Bealle, G; Michel, A; Latorre-Ossa, H; Rey, C; Fouassier, L; Claperon, A; Brulle, L; Girard, E; Servant, N; Rio-Frio, T; Marie, H; Lesieur, S; Housset, C; Gennisson, JL; Tanter, M; Menager, C; Fre, S; Robine, S; Farge, E",,,,,92,,"[Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Farge, Emmanuel] PSL Res Univ, Fdn Pierre Gilles Gennes, CNRS UMR Physicochim Curie Mech & Genet Embryon &, Inst Curie,Ctr Rech,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Menager, Christine] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, Lab PHENIX Physicochim Electrolytes & Nanosyst In, CNRS UMR 8234, F-75005 Paris, France; [Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, Waves & Images ESPCI ParisTech, Langevin Inst, CNRS UMR7587,Inserm U979, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, F-75012 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] INSERM, UMR S 938, CDR St Antoine, F-75012 Paris, France; [Brulle, Laura] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS UMR3666, INSERM Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery U, F-75005 Paris, France; [Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas] Inst Curie, MINES ParisTech, Bioinformat Platform, U900, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rio-Frio, Thomas] Inst Curie, Next Generat Sequencing Platform, F-75005 Paris, France; [Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane] Univ Paris 11, Lab Physicochim Syst Polyphases, Fac Pharm, CNRS UMR 8612,Inst Galien Paris Sud,LabEx LERMIT, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Fre, Silvia] Inst Curie, Unite Genet & Biol Dev, Notch Signaling Stem Cells & Tumors, CNRS UMR 3215,INSERM U934,Ctr Rech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Robine, Sylvie] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS Compartimentat & Dynam Cellulaires Morphogen, F-75005 Paris, France",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14329,Article,1476-4687,efarge@curie.fr,+,"CNRS; INSERM; ARC [5030, 29324]; ANR [09PIRI0013-01, 11 BSV5014-01]; Labex CelTisPhyBio [11-LBX-0038]; Fonds CSP; Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes; Fondation de France; Inca [PLBIO13-172]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (investissements d'avenir) [ANR-10-EQPX-03, ANR10-INBS-09-08]; Canceropole Ile-de-France","This research was funded by the CNRS, INSERM, ARC (grant no.s 5030 and 29324), ANR (grant no.s 09PIRI0013-01 and 11 BSV5014-01), the Labex CelTisPhyBio (grant no. 11-LBX-0038), Fonds CSP, Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes, Fondation de France and the Inca (grant no.

437,437.0,"Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) activation of SF3B1 and SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of SF3B1 orgenetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.","Mirtschink, Peter; Krishnan, Jaya; Grimm, Fiona; Sarre, Alexandre; Hoerl, Manuel; Kayikci, Melis; Fankhauser, Niklaus; Christinat, Yann; Cortijo, Cedric; Feehan, Owen; Vukolic, Ana; Sossalla, Samuel; Stehr, Sebastian N.; Ule, Jernej; Zamboni, Nicola; Pedrazzini, Thierry; Krek, Wilhelm",,"Mirtschink, P; Krishnan, J; Grimm, F; Sarre, A; Horl, M; Kayikci, M; Fankhauser, N; Christinat, Y; Cortijo, C; Feehan, O; Vukolic, A; Sossalla, S; Stehr, SN; Ule, J; Zamboni, N; Pedrazzini, T; Krek, W",,,,,444,,"[Mirtschink, Peter; Krishnan, Jaya; Grimm, Fiona; Fankhauser, Niklaus; Christinat, Yann; Cortijo, Cedric; Feehan, Owen; Vukolic, Ana; Krek, Wilhelm] ETH, Inst Mol Hlth Sci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sarre, Alexandre; Pedrazzini, Thierry] Univ Lausanne, Dept Med, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hoerl, Manuel; Zamboni, Nicola] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kayikci, Melis; Ule, Jernej] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Sossalla, Samuel] Univ Med Gottingen, Klin Kardiol & Pneumol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Sossalla, Samuel] DZHK German Ctr Cardiovasc Res, Partner Site Gottingen, Hamburg, Germany; [Stehr, Sebastian N.] Univ Hosp Jena, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, D-07747 Jena, Germany",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14508,Article,1476-4687,wilhelm.krek@biol.ethz.ch,+,Sinergia (Swiss National Science Foundation); Swiss Heart Foundation,"We thank S.

438,438.0,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is a multimeric RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls chromosome segregation and mitotic exit. Its regulation by coactivator subunits, phosphorylation, the mitotic checkpoint complex and interphase early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) ensures the correct order and timing of distinct cell-cycle transitions. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine atomic structures of APC/C-coactivator complexes with either Emi1 or a UbcH10-ubiquitin conjugate. These structures define the architecture of all APC/C subunits, the position of the catalytic module and explain how Emi1 mediates inhibition of the two E2s UbcH10 and Ube2S. Definition of Cdh1 interactions with the APC/C indicates how they are antagonized by Cdh1 phosphorylation. The structure of the APC/C with UbcH10-ubiquitin reveals insights into the initiating ubiquitination reaction.

449,449.0,"The bacterial ubiD and ubiX or the homologous fungal fdc1 and pad1 genes have been implicated in the non-oxidative reversible decarboxylation of aromatic substrates, and play a pivotal role in bacterial ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) biosynthesis(1-3) or microbial biodegradation of aromatic compounds(4-6), respectively. Despite biochemical studies on individual gene products, the composition and cofactor requirement of the enzyme responsible for in vivo decarboxylase activity remained unclear(7-9). Here we show that Fdc1 is solely responsible for the reversible decarboxylase activity, and that it requires a new type of cofactor: a prenylated flavin synthesized by the associated UbiX/Pad1(10). Atomic resolution crystal structures reveal that two distinct isomers of the oxidized cofactor can be observed, an isoalloxazine N5-iminium adduct and a N5 secondary ketimine species with markedly altered ring structure, both having azomethine ylide character. Substrate binding positions the dipolarophile enoic acid group directly above the azomethine ylide group. The structure of a covalent inhibitor-cofactor adduct suggests that 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry supports reversible decarboxylation in these enzymes. Although 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is commonly used in organic chemistry(11,12), we propose that this presents the first example, to our knowledge, of an enzymatic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Our model for Fdc1/UbiD catalysis offers new routes in alkene hydrocarbon production or aryl (de) carboxylation.","Payne, Karl A.

450,450.0,"Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is a ubiquitous lipid-soluble redox cofactor that is an essential component of electron transfer chains(1). Eleven genes have been implicated in bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis, including ubiX and ubiD, which are responsible for decarboxylation of the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate precursor(2). Despite structural and biochemical characterization of UbiX as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein, no decarboxylase activity has been detected(3,4). Here we report that UbiX produces a novel flavin-derived cofactor required for the decarboxylase activity of UbiD(5). UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase, linking a dimethylallyl moiety to the flavin N5 and C6 atoms. This adds a fourth non-aromatic ring to the flavin isoalloxazine group. In contrast to other prenyltransferases(6,7), UbiX is metal-independent and requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate as substrate. Kinetic crystallography reveals that the prenyltransferase mechanism of UbiX resembles that of the terpene synthases(8). The active site environment is dominated by pi systems, which assist phosphate-C1' bond breakage following FMN reduction, leading to formation of the N5-C1' bond. UbiX then acts as a chaperone for adduct reorientation, via transient carbocation species, leading ultimately to formation of the dimethylallyl C3'-C6 bond. Our findings establish the mechanism for formation of a new flavin-derived cofactor, extending both flavin and terpenoid biochemical repertoires.","White, Mark D.; Payne, Karl A.

455,455.0,"The ability of an atom or molecular fragment to bind multiple carbon monoxide (CO) molecules to form multicarbonyl adducts is a fundamental trait of transition metals. Transition-metal carbonyl complexes are vital to industry, appear naturally in the active sites of a number of enzymes (such as hydrogenases), are promising therapeutic agents(1), and have even been observed in interstellar dust clouds(2). Despite the wealth of established transition-metal multicarbonyl complexes(3), no elements outside groups 4 to 12 of the periodic table have yet been shown to react directly with two or more CO units to form stable multicarbonyl adducts. Here we present the synthesis of a borylene dicarbonyl complex, the first multicarbonyl complex of a main-group element prepared using CO. The compound is additionally stable towards ambient air and moisture. The synthetic strategy used-liberation of a borylene ligand from a transition metal using donor ligands-is broadly applicable, leading to a number of unprecedented monovalent boron species with different Lewis basic groups. The similarity of these compounds to conventional transition-metal carbonyl complexes is demonstrated by photolytic liberation of CO and subsequent intramolecular carbon-carbon bond activation.","Braunschweig, Holger; Dewhurst, Rian D.; Hupp, Florian; Nutz, Marco; Radacki, Krzysztof; Tate, Christopher W.; Vargas, Alfredo; Ye, Qing",,"Braunschweig, H; Dewhurst, RD; Hupp, F; Nutz, M; Radacki, K; Tate, CW; Vargas, A; Ye, Q",,,,,327,,"[Braunschweig, Holger; Dewhurst, Rian D.; Hupp, Florian; Nutz, Marco; Radacki, Krzysztof; Tate, Christopher W.; Ye, Qing] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Vargas, Alfredo] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Dept Chem, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14489,Article,1476-4687,h.braunschweig@uni-wuerzburg.de,330,European Research Council,This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant to H.B.,CK7PU,,Y,,N,BORON TRIPLE BOND; DATIVE BONDS; SOLID-STATE; ACTIVATION; REACTIVITY; COMPOUND; CARBENES; CARBONYL; ARROWS; ADDUCT,7556.0,NATURE,Nature,English,,30.0,No,"Vargas, Alfredo/0000-0001-7491-791X; Braunschweig, Holger/0000-0001-9264-1726; Dewhurst, Rian/0000-0001-5978-811X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-Jun,4.0,LONDON,26085273.0,,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,"Ye, Qing/J-2736-2014; Vargas, Alfredo/N-6711-2015","Braunschweig, H (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,0028-0836,NATURE,,,70.0,Multiple complexation of CO and related ligands to a main-group element,9.0,76.0,WOS:000356425400050,522,Multidisciplinary Sciences,70,qing,ye,4503,27,female,1,kyw15pIAAAAJ,51548610,1
456,456.0,"Theropod dinosaurs were the dominant predators inmost Mesozoic era terrestrial ecosystems(1). Early theropod evolution is currently interpreted as the diversification of various carnivorous and cursorial taxa, whereas the acquisition of herbivorism, together with the secondary loss of cursorial adaptations, occurred much later among advanced coelurosaurian theropods(1,2). A new, bizarre herbivorous basal tetanuran from the Upper Jurassic of Chile challenges this conception. The new dinosaur was discovered at Aysen, a fossil locality in the Upper Jurassic Toqui Formation of southern Chile (General Carrera Lake)(3,4). The site yielded abundant and exquisitely preserved three-dimensional skeletons of small archosaurs.

460,460.0,"Mutations or amplification of the MET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several tumours(1-4), which rely on the constitutive engagement of this pathway for their growth and survival(1,5). However, MET is expressed not only by cancer cells but also by tumour-associated stromal cells, although its precise role in this compartment is not well characterized(6-11). Here we show that MET is required for neutrophil chemoattraction and cytotoxicity in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Met deletion in mouse neutrophils enhances tumour growth and metastasis. This phenotype correlates with reduced neutrophil infiltration to both the primary tumour and metastatic sites. Similarly, Met is necessary for neutrophil transudation during colitis, skin rash or peritonitis. Mechanistically, Met is induced by tumour-derived tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or other inflammatory stimuli in both mouse and human neutrophils. This induction is instrumental for neutrophil transmigration across an activated endothelium and for inducible nitric oxide synthase production upon HGF stimulation. Consequently, HGF/MET-dependent nitric oxide release by neutrophils promotes cancer cell killing, which abates tumour growth and metastasis. After systemic administration of a MET kinase inhibitor, we prove that the therapeutic benefit of MET targeting in cancer cells is partly countered by the pro-tumoural effect arising from MET blockade in neutrophils.

463,463.0,"About half of human genes use alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (ApA) to generate messenger RNA transcripts that differ in the length of their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) while producing the same protein(1-3). Here we show in human cell lines that alternative 3' UTRs differentially regulate the localization of membrane proteins. The long 3' UTR of CD47 enables efficient cell surface expression of CD47 protein, whereas the short 3' UTR primarily localizes CD47 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. CD47 protein localization occurs post-translationally and independently of RNA localization. In our model of 3' UTR-dependent protein localization, the long 3' UTR of CD47 acts as a scaffold to recruit a protein complex containing the RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAVL1) and SET4 to the site of translation. This facilitates interaction of SET with the newly translated cytoplasmic domains of CD47 and results in subsequent translocation of CD47 to the plasma membrane via activated RAC1 (ref. 5). We also show that CD47 protein has different functions depending on whether it was generated by the short or long 3' UTR isoforms. Thus, ApA contributes to the functional diversity of the proteome without changing the amino acid sequence. 3' UTR-dependent protein localization has the potential to be a widespread trafficking mechanism for membrane proteins because HuR binds to thousands of mRNAs(6-9), and we show that the long 3' UTRs of CD44, ITGA1 and TNFRSF13C, which are bound by HuR, increase surface protein expression compared to their corresponding short 3' UTRs. We propose that during translation the scaffold function of 3' UTRs facilitates binding of proteins to nascent proteins to direct their transport or function-and this role of 3' UTRs can be regulated by ApA.","Berkovits, Binyamin D.; Mayr, Christine",,"Berkovits, BD; Mayr, C",,,,,363,,"[Berkovits, Binyamin D.; Mayr, Christine] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14321,Article,1476-4687,mayrc@mskcc.org,+,Damon Runyon-Rachleff Cancer Foundation; Island Outreach Foundation [DRR-24-13]; National Institutes of Health [U01-CA164190];  [P30 CA008748],"This work was funded by the Innovator Award of the Damon Runyon-Rachleff Cancer Foundation and the Island Outreach Foundation (DRR-24-13) and National Institutes of Health grant U01-CA164190.

465,465.0,"The Bronze Age of Eurasia (around 3000-1000 BC) was a period of major cultural changes. However, there is debate about whether these changes resulted from the circulation of ideas or from human migrations, potentially also facilitating the spread of languages and certain phenotypic traits. We investigated this by using new, improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacements, responsible for shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized spread of Indo-European languages during the Early Bronze Age. We also demonstrate that light skin pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency in the Bronze Age, but not lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive selection on lactose tolerance than previously thought.","Allentoft, Morten E.; Sikora, Martin; Sjogren, Karl-Goran; Rasmussen, Simon; Rasmussen, Morten; Stenderup, Jesper; Damgaard, Peter B.; Schroeder, Hannes; Ahlstrom, Torbjorn; Vinner, Lasse; Malaspinas, Anna-Sapfo; Margaryan, Ashot; Higham, Tom; Chivall, David; Lynnerup, Niels; Harvig, Lise; Baron, Justyna; Della Casa, Philippe; Dabrowski, Pawel; Duffy, Paul R.; Ebel, Alexander V.; Epimakhov, Andrey; Frei, Karin; Furmanek, Miroslaw; Gralak, Tomasz; Gromov, Andrey; Gronkiewicz, Stanislaw; Grupe, Gisela; Hajdu, Tamas; Jarysz, Radoslaw; Khartanovich, Valeri; Khokhlov, Alexandr; Kiss, Viktoria; Kolar, Jan; Kriiska, Aivar; Lasak, Irena; Longhi, Cristina; McGlynn, George; Merkevicius, Algimantas; Merkyte, Inga; Metspalu, Mait; Mkrtchyan, Ruzan; Moiseyev, Vyacheslav; Paja, Laszlo; Palfi, Gyoergy; Pokutta, Dalia; Pospieszny, Lukasz; Price, T.

473,473.0,"We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies(1-8) and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, similar to 8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a similar to 24,000-year-old Siberian(6). By similar to 6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact similar to 4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced similar to 75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least similar to 3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin(9) of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","Haak, Wolfgang; Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Llamas, Bastien; Brandt, Guido; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Mittnik, Alissa; Banffy, Eszter; Economou, Christos; Francken, Michael; Friederich, Susanne; Pena, Rafael Garrido; Hallgren, Fredrik; Khartanovich, Valery; Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kunst, Michael; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Meller, Harald; Mochalov, Oleg; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav; Nicklisch, Nicole; Pichler, Sandra L.; Risch, Roberto; Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Wahl, Joachim; Meyer, Matthias; Krause, Johannes; Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David; Cooper, Alan; Alt, Kurt Werner; Reich, David",,"Haak, W; Lazaridis, I; Patterson, N; Rohland, N; Mallick, S; Llamas, B; Brandt, G; Nordenfelt, S; Harney, E; Stewardson, K; Fu, QM; Mittnik, A; Banffy, E; Economou, C; Francken, M; Friederich, S; Pena, RG; Hallgren, F; Khartanovich, V; Khokhlov, A; Kunst, M; Kuznetsov, P; Meller, H; Mochalov, O; Moiseyev, V; Nicklisch, N; Pichler, SL; Risch, R; Guerra, MAR; Roth, C; Szecsenyi-Nagy, A; Wahl, J; Meyer, M; Krause, J; Brown, D; Anthony, D; Cooper, A; Alt, KW; Reich, D",,,,,207,,"[Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brandt, Guido; Nicklisch, Nicole; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Alt, Kurt Werner] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei; Meyer, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei] Chinese Acad Sci, IVPP, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mittnik, Alissa; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Banffy, Eszter; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol, Res Ctr Humanities, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Banffy, Eszter] RGK, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Economou, Christos] Stockholm Univ, Archaeol Res Lab, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Paleoanthropol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Archaeogenet, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Friederich, Susanne; Meller, Harald; Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Saxony Anhalt & State Museum Prehist, State Off Heritage Management & Archaeol, D-06114 Halle, Germany; [Pena, Rafael Garrido] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Hallgren, Fredrik] Cultural Heritage Fdn, S-72212 Vasteras, Sweden; [Khartanovich, Valery; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav] Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Mochalov, Oleg] Volga State Acad Social Sci & Humanities, Samara 443099, Russia; [Kunst, Michael] Deutsch Archaeol Inst, Abt Madrid, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Danube Private Univ, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Pichler, Sandra L.; Alt, Kurt Werner] Univ Basel, Inst Prehist & Archaeol Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Risch, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, D-78467 Constance, Germany; [Krause, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David] Hartwick Coll, Dept Anthropol, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14317,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,"Australian Research Council [DP130102158]; German Research Foundation [Al 287/7-1, 7-3, Al 287/10-1, Al 287/14-1, Me 3245/1-1, 1-3]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID grant [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank P.

476,476.0,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections, and comprise nearly 8% of the human genome(1). The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor(2,3). Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins(4). However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection(5-7). Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development.","Grow, Edward J.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Chavez, Shawn L.; Bayless, Nicholas L.; Wossidlo, Mark; Wesche, Daniel J.; Martin, Lance; Ware, Carol B.; Blish, Catherine A.; Chang, Howard Y.; Pera, Renee A.

478,478.0,"At the onset of metazoan cell division the nuclear envelope breaks down to enable capture of chromosomes by the microtubule-containing spindle apparatus(1). During anaphase, when chromosomes have separated, the nuclear envelope is reassembled around the forming daughter nuclei(1,2). How the nuclear envelope is sealed, and how this is coordinated with spindle disassembly, is largely unknown. Here we show that endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III, previously found to promote membrane constriction and sealing during receptor sorting, virus budding, cytokinesis and plasma membrane repair(3-6), is transiently recruited to the reassembling nuclear envelope during late anaphase. ESCRT-III and its regulatory AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase VPS4 are specifically recruited by the ESCRT-III-like protein CHMP7 to sites where the reforming nuclear envelope engulfs spindle microtubules. Subsequent association of another ESCRT-III-like protein, IST1, directly recruits the AAA ATPase spastin to sever microtubules. Disrupting spastin function impairs spindle disassembly and results in extended localization of ESCRT-III at the nuclear envelope. Interference with ESCRT-III functions in anaphase is accompanied by delayed microtubule disassembly, compromised nuclear integrity and the appearance of DNA damage foci in subsequent interphase. We propose that ESCRT-III, VPS4 and spastin cooperate to coordinate nuclear envelope sealing and spindle disassembly at nuclear envelope-microtubule intersection sites during mitotic exit to ensure nuclear integrity and genome safeguarding, with a striking mechanistic parallel to cytokinetic abscission(7).","Vietri, Marina; Schink, Kay O.; Campsteijn, Coen; Wegner, Catherine Sem; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Christ, Liliane; Thoresen, Sigrid B.; Brech, Andreas; Raiborg, Camilla; Stenmark, Harald",,"Vietri, M; Schink, KO; Campsteijn, C; Wegner, CS; Schultz, SW; Christ, L; Thoresen, SB; Brech, A; Raiborg, C; Stenmark, H",,,,,231,,"[Vietri, Marina; Schink, Kay O.; Campsteijn, Coen; Wegner, Catherine Sem; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Christ, Liliane; Thoresen, Sigrid B.; Brech, Andreas; Raiborg, Camilla; Stenmark, Harald] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Ctr Canc Biomed, N-0379 Oslo, Norway; [Vietri, Marina; Schink, Kay O.; Campsteijn, Coen; Wegner, Catherine Sem; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Christ, Liliane; Thoresen, Sigrid B.; Brech, Andreas; Raiborg, Camilla; Stenmark, Harald] Oslo Univ Hosp, Inst Canc Res, Dept Mol Cell Biol, N-0379 Oslo, Norway; [Stenmark, Harald] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Ctr Mol Inflammat Res, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14408,Article,1476-4687,coen.campsteijn@rr-research.no; stenmark@ulrik.uio.no,+,European Research Council; Research Council of Norway through Centres of Excellence [179571],"We thank T.

492,491.0,"Tissue homeostasis is achieved through a balance of cell production (growth) and elimination (regression)(1,2). In contrast to tissue growth, the cells and molecular signals required for tissue regression remain unknown. To investigate physiological tissue regression, we use the mouse hair follicle, which cycles stereotypically between phases of growth and regression while maintaining a pool of stem cells to perpetuate tissue regeneration(3). Here we show by intravital microscopy in live mice(4-6) that the regression phase eliminates the majority of the epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms: terminal differentiation of suprabasal cells and a spatial gradient of apoptosis of basal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to clear dying epithelial neighbours. Through cellular and genetic ablation we show that epithelial cell death is extrinsically induced through transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta activation and mesenchymal crosstalk. Strikingly, our data show that regression acts to reduce the stem cell pool, as inhibition of regression results in excess basal epithelial cells with regenerative abilities. This study identifies the cellular behaviours and molecular mechanisms of regression that counterbalance growth to maintain tissue homeostasis.","Mesa, Kailin R.; Rompolas, Panteleimon; Zito, Giovanni; Myung, Peggy; Sun, Thomas Y.; Brown, Samara; Gonzalez, David G.; Blagoev, Krastan B.; Haberman, Ann M.; Greco, Valentina",,"Mesa, KR; Rompolas, P; Zito, G; Myung, P; Sun, TY; Brown, S; Gonzalez, DG; Blagoev, KB; Haberman, AM; Greco, V",,,,,94,,"[Mesa, Kailin R.; Rompolas, Panteleimon; Myung, Peggy; Sun, Thomas Y.; Brown, Samara; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Zito, Giovanni] Univ Palermo, Dept Biopathol & Med Biotechnol, I-90100 Palermo, Italy; [Myung, Peggy; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Gonzalez, David G.; Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Blagoev, Krastan B.] Natl Sci Fdn, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Blagoev, Krastan B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, AA Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging,Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14306,Article,1476-4687,valentina.greco@yale.edu,U236,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5T32 GM007223]; American Cancer Society [RSG-12-059-02]; National Cancer Institute, NIH [2P50CA121974]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), NIH [1R01AR063663-01]; New York Stem Cell Foundation; NIAMS Rheumatic Diseases Research Core Centers [5 P30 AR053495-07]; NSF","We thank E.

497,496.0,"Jets of highly energized plasma with relativistic velocities are associated with black holes ranging in mass from a few times that of the Sun to the billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of galaxies(1). A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady(2). Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields(3). This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects(4-7), with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets(8,9). Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries(10,11), apparent superluminal motions(12,13), and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies(14,15). Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. Abright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 +/- 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 +/- 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots-as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging.","Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos; Sparks, William B.; Perlman, Eric; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco",,"Meyer, ET; Georganopoulos, M; Sparks, WB; Perlman, E; van der Marel, RP; Anderson, J; Sohn, ST; Biretta, J; Norman, C; Chiaberge, M",,,,,495,,"[Meyer, Eileen T.; Sparks, William B.; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Georganopoulos, Markos] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Perlman, Eric] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chiaberge, Marco] Ist Radio Astron, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",,,,,,,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14481,Article,1476-4687,eileen.meyer@gmail.com,+,HST [GO-13327],E.T.M. acknowledges HST grant GO-13327.,DF8BN,,,,,GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; M87 JET; 3C 264; EMISSION; MOTION; MODEL,7553.0,NATURE,Nature,English,,28.0,No,"van der Marel, Roeland/0000-0001-7827-7825; Norman, Colin/0000-0002-5222-5717","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-May,13.0,LONDON,26017450.0,,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Meyer, ET (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,0028-0836,NATURE,,,6.0,A kiloparsec-scale internal shock collision in the jet of a nearby radio galaxy,2.0,5.0,WOS:000371582000002,521,Multidisciplinary Sciences,6,marco,chiaberge,4640,2493,male,0.99,_UA9uSEAAAAJ,na,0
