Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall(1), European summer precipitation(2), Atlantic hurricanes(3) and variations in global temperatures(4). It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content(5). However, there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from another source(6). Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres-the intergyre region(7). These circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is declining(8) and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures(4), but in the coupled system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the northeast coast of the United States(9,10).","[McCarthy, Gerard D.; Hirschi, Joel J. -M.; Grist, Jeremy P.; Smeed, David A.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Haigh, Ivan D.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","McCarthy, GD (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",gerard.mccarthy@noc.ac.uk,"Jeremy, Grist/B-4517-2012",,UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) RAPID-WATCH programme; UK NERC consortium project iGlass [NE/I009906/1]; NERC,G.D.M. and D.A.S. are supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) RAPID-WATCH programme.

In cortex, however, these patterns lie in a space of lower dimension(1-4), as if individual neurons were ""obedientmembers of a huge orchestra''(5). Here we use recordings from the visual cortex of mouse (Mus musculus) and monkey (Macaca mulatta) to investigate the relationship between individual neurons and the population, and to establish the underlying circuit mechanisms. We show that neighbouring neurons can differ in their coupling to the overall firing of the population, ranging from strongly coupled 'choristers' to weakly coupled 'soloists'. Population coupling is largely independent of sensory preferences, and it is a fixed cellular attribute, invariant to stimulus conditions. Neurons with high population coupling are more strongly affected by non-sensory behavioural variables such as motor intention. Population coupling reflects a causal relationship, predicting the response of a neuron to optogenetically driven increases in local activity. Moreover, population coupling indicates synaptic connectivity; the population coupling of a neuron, measured in vivo, predicted subsequent in vitro estimates of the number of synapses received from its neighbours. Finally, population coupling provides a compact summary of population activity; knowledge of the population couplings of n neurons predicts a substantial portion of their n(2) pairwise correlations. Population coupling therefore represents a novel, simple measure that characterizes the relationship of each neuron to a larger population, explaining seemingly complex network firing patterns in terms of basic circuit variables.","[Okun, Michael; Steinmetz, Nicholas A.; Harris, Kenneth D.] UCL, UCL Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Okun, Michael; Steinmetz, Nicholas A.; Cossell, Lee; Iacaruso, M.

While cyclic 'rock-paper-scissors' interactions can stabilize communities in spatial environments(9-11), coexistence in unstructured environments remains unexplained(12,16). Here, using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed environments. Coexistence depends on three-way interactions in which an antibiotic-degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two other species. These interactions enable coexistence that is robust to substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by 'cheating' species that cease to produce or degrade antibiotics. At least two antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamic behaviours ranging from stable fixed points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both spatially structured and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin production and degradation for microbial biodiversity.","[Kelsic, Eric D.; Zhao, Jeffrey; Kishony, Roy] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vetsigian, Kalin] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bacteriol, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Vetsigian, Kalin] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Inst Discovery, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Kishony, Roy] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biol, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Kishony, Roy] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel","Vetsigian, K (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bacteriol, Madison, WI 53715 USA.",kalin@discovery.wisc.edu; rkishony@technion.ac.il,,"Kelsic, Eric/0000-0002-5331-5204","Department of Defense, Office of Naval Research, National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship [32 CFR 168a]; Research Science Institute at MIT; University of Wisconsin-Madison; James S.

Agenetic contributionis strongly suggested by the association of CHD with chromosome abnormalities and high recurrence risk(4). Here we report findings from a recessive forward genetic screen in fetal mice, showing that cilia and ciliatransduced cell signalling have important roles in the pathogenesis of CHD. The cilium is an evolutionarily conserved organelle projecting from the cell surface with essential roles in diverse cellular processes. Using echocardiography, we ultrasound scanned 87,355 chemically mutagenized C57BL/6J fetal mice and recovered 218 CHD mouse models. Whole-exome sequencing identified 91 recessive CHD mutations in 61 genes. This included 34 cilia-related genes, 16 genes involved in cilia-transduced cell signalling, and 10 genes regulating vesicular trafficking, a pathway important for ciliogenesis and cell signalling. Surprisingly, many CHD genes encoded interacting proteins, suggesting that an interactome protein network may provide a larger genomic context for CHD pathogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the potential Mendelian genetic contribution to CHD in the fetal population, a segment of the human population not well studied. We note that the pathways identified show overlap with CHD candidate genes recovered in CHD patients(5), suggesting that they may have relevance to the more complex genetics of CHD overall. These CHD mouse models and >8,000 incidental mutations have been sperm archived, creating a rich public resource for human disease modelling.","[Li, You; Klena, Nikolai T.; Gabriel, George C.; Liu, Xiaoqin; Kim, Andrew J.; Lemke, Kristi; Chen, Yu; Chatterjee, Bishwanath; Damerla, Rama Rao; Chang, Chienfu; Yagi, Hisato; Anderton, Shane; Lawhead, Caroline; Vescovi, Anita; Francis, Richard; Tobita, Kimimasa; Lo, Cecilia W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA; [Devine, William] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [San Agustin, Jovenal T.; Pazour, Gregory J.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Thahir, Mohamed; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Pittsburgh, PA 15206 USA; [Thahir, Mohamed; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Arts & Sci, Intelligent Syst Program, Pittsburgh, PA 16260 USA; [Pratt, Herbert; Morgan, Judy; Haynes, Leslie; Smith, Cynthia L.; Eppig, Janan T.; Reinholdt, Laura] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Leatherbury, Linda] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Ctr Heart, Washington, DC 20010 USA","Lo, CW (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA.",cel36@pitt.edu,"Francis, Richard/P-2524-2015; Smith, Cynthia/A-5646-2009","Smith, Cynthia/0000-0003-3691-0324; Pratt, Herb/0000-0002-4964-8292; Damerla, Rama Rao/0000-0001-6815-0097; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi/0000-0002-3825-0924; Pazour, Gregory/0000-0002-6285-8796","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [U01HL098180, U01HL098188]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH094564]; National Human Genome Research Institute [HG000330]; University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine","We thank R.

How mitochondrial biogenesis coordinates with the removal of damaged or superfluous mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis is not well understood. Here we show that mitophagy, a selective type of autophagy targeting mitochondria for degradation, interfaces with mitochondrial biogenesis to regulate mitochondrial content and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that DCT-1 is a key mediator of mitophagy and longevity assurance under conditions of stress in C. elegans. Impairment of mitophagy compromises stress resistance and triggers mitochondrial retrograde signalling through the SKN-1 transcription factor that regulates both mitochondrial biogenesis genes and mitophagy by enhancing DCT-1 expression. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback loop that integrates metabolic signals to coordinate the biogenesis and turnover of mitochondria. Uncoupling of these two processes during ageing contributes to overproliferation of damaged mitochondria and decline of cellular function.","[Palikaras, Konstantinos; Lionaki, Eirini; Tavernarakis, Nektarios] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 70013, Crete, Greece; [Palikaras, Konstantinos] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion 70013, Crete, Greece; [Tavernarakis, Nektarios] Univ Crete, Fac Med, Dept Basic Sci, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece","Tavernarakis, N (reprint author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Nikolaou Plastira 100, Iraklion 70013, Crete, Greece.",tavernarakis@imbb.forth.gr,"Tavernarakis, Nektarios/B-9684-2013","Tavernarakis, Nektarios/0000-0002-5253-1466",National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health; National Bioresource Project in Japan; European Research Council; European Commission; Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology,"We thank A.

Anterograde transport through the Golgi has been explained by the movement of Golgi cisternae, known as cisternal maturation(3-5). Because this explanation is now appreciated to be incomplete(6), interest has developed in understanding tubules that connect the Golgi cisternae(7-9). Here we show that the coat protein (COPI) complex sorts anterograde cargoes into these tubules in human cells. Moreover, the small GTPase CDC42 regulates bidirectional Golgi transport by targeting the dual functions of COPI in cargo sorting and carrier formation. CDC42 also directly imparts membrane curvature to promote COPI tubule formation. Our findings further reveal that COPI tubular transport complements cisternal maturation in explaining how anterograde Golgi transport is achieved, and that bidirectional COPI transport is modulated by environmental cues through CDC42.","[Park, Seung-Yeol; Yang, Jia-Shu; Hsu, Victor W.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Seung-Yeol; Yang, Jia-Shu; Schmider, Angela B.; Soberman, Roy J.; Hsu, Victor W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schmider, Angela B.; Soberman, Roy J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Nephrol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Schmider, Angela B.; Soberman, Roy J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Soberman, Roy J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mol Imaging Core, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA","Hsu, VW (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",vhsu@research.bwh.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM058615, R01AI068871, R01AR065538, 1S10RR027931-01, K01DK089145]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2014R1A6A3A03056673]","We thank J.

Here we reconstitute RISC assembly using only Ago2, Dicer-2, R2D2, Hsc70, Hsp90, Hop, Droj2 (an Hsp40 homologue) and p23. By following the assembly of single RISC molecules, we find that, in the absence of the chaperone machinery, an siRNA bound to Dicer-2-R2D2 associates with Ago2 only transiently. The chaperone machinery extends the dwell time of the Dicer-2-R2D2-siRNA complex on Ago2, in a manner dependent on recognition of the 59-phosphate on the siRNA guide strand.

By fuelling the generation of genetic alterations and by compromising cell viability, genomic instability is a driving force in cancer and ageing(1,2). Here we identify MAD2L2 (also known as MAD2B or REV7) through functional genetic screening as a novel factor controlling DNA repair activities at mammalian telomeres. We show that MAD2L2 accumulates at uncapped telomeres and promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated fusion of deprotected chromosome ends and genomic instability. MAD2L2 depletion causes elongated 39 telomeric overhangs, indicating that MAD2L2 inhibits 59 end resection. End resection blocks NHEJ while committing to homology-directed repair, and is under the control of 53BP1, RIF1 and PTIP3. Consistent with MAD2L2 promoting NHEJ-mediated telomere fusion by inhibiting 5' end resection, knockdown of the nucleases CTIP or EXO1 partially restores telomere-driven genomic instability in MAD2L2-depleted cells. Control of DNA repair by MAD2L2 is not limited to telomeres. MAD2L2 also accumulates and inhibits end resection at irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and promotes end-joining of DNA double-strand breaks in several settings, including during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. These activities of MAD2L2 depend on ATM kinase activity, RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 and RIF1, but not on PTIP, REV1 and REV3, the latter two acting with MAD2L2 in translesion synthesis(4). Together, our data establish MAD2L2 as a crucial contributor to the control of DNA repair activity by 53BP1 that promotes NHEJ by inhibiting 5' end resection downstream of RIF1.","[Boersma, Vera; Moatti, Nathalie; Segura-Bayona, Sandra; Peuscher, Marieke H.; van der Torre, Jaco; Wevers, Brigitte A.; Jacobs, Jacqueline J.

In the absence of BRCA1-mediated HR, the administration of PARP inhibitors induces synthetic lethality of tumour cells of patients with breast or ovarian cancers(2,3). Despite the benefit of this tailored therapy, drug resistance can occur by HR restoration(4). Genetic reversion of BRCA1-inactivating mutations can be the underlying mechanism of drug resistance, but this does not explain resistance in all cases(5). In particular, little is known about BRCA1-independent restoration of HR. Here we show that loss of REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) in mouse and human cell lines re-establishes CTIP-dependent endresection of DSBs in BRCA1 deficient cells, leading to HR restoration and PARP inhibitor resistance, which is reversed by ATM kinase inhibition. REV7 is recruited to DSBs in a manner dependent on the H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1 chromatin pathway, and seems to block HR and promote end joining in addition to its regulatory role in DNA damage tolerance(6). Finally, we establish that REV7 blocks DSB resection to promote non-homologous end-joining during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Our results reveal an unexpected crucial function of REV7 downstream of 53BP1 in coordinating pathological DSB repair pathway choices in BRCA1-deficient cells.","[Xu, Guotai; Gogola, Ewa; Barazas, Marco; Jaspers, Janneke E.; Kersbergen, Ariena; Sol, Wendy; Borst, Piet; Rottenberg, Sven] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Oncol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chapman, J.

Protective antigen forms oligomeric prepores that undergo conversion to membrane-spanning pores by endosomal acidification, and these pores translocate the enzymes lethal factor and oedema factor into the cytosol of target cells(1). Protective antigen is not only a vaccine component and therapeutic target for anthrax infections but also an excellent model system for understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. On the basis of biochemical and electrophysiological results, researchers have proposed that a phi (Phi)-clamp composed of phenylalanine (Phe)427 residues of protective antigen catalyses protein translocation via a charge-state-dependent Brownian ratchet(2-9). Although atomic structures of protective antigen prepores are available(10-14), how protective antigen senses low pH, converts to active pore, and translocates lethal factor and oedema factor are not well defined without an atomic model of its pore. Here, by cryoelectron microscopy with direct electron counting, we determine the protective antigen pore structure at 2.9-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the long-sought-after catalytic Phi-clamp and the membrane-spanning translocation channel, and supports the Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation. Comparisons of four structures reveal conformational changes in prepore to pore conversion that support a multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the membrane-spanning channel is formed.","[Jiang, Jiansen; Zhou, Z.

New fieldwork in West Turkana, Kenya, has identified evidence of much earlier hominin technological behaviour. We report the discovery of Lomekwi 3, a 3.3-million-year-old archaeological site where in situ stone artefacts occur in spatio-temporal association with Pliocene hominin fossils in a wooded palaeoenvironment. The Lomekwi 3 knappers, with a developing understanding of stone's fracture properties, combined core reduction with battering activities. Given the implications of the Lomekwi 3 assemblage for models aiming to converge environmental change, hominin evolution and technological origins, we propose for it the name 'Lomekwian', which predates the Oldowan by 700,000 years and marks a new beginning to the known archaeological record.","[Harmand, Sonia; Lewis, Jason E.; Leakey, Louise] SUNY Stony Brook, Turkana Basin Inst, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Harmand, Sonia; Arroyo, Adrian; Taylor, Nicholas; Roche, Helene] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, CNRS, UMR Prehist & Technol 7055, F-92023 Nanterre, France; [Harmand, Sonia; Lewis, Jason E.; Feibel, Craig S.; Lepre, Christopher J.; Prat, Sandrine; Lenoble, Arnaud; Boes, Xavier; Quinn, Rhonda L.; Taylor, Nicholas; Clement, Sophie; Brugal, Jean-Philip; Lokorodi, Sammy; Kirwa, Christopher; Roche, Helene] West Turkana Archaeol Project, Nairobi, Kenya; [Lewis, Jason E.; Feibel, Craig S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Lewis, Jason E.; Feibel, Craig S.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Human Evolutionary Studies, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Feibel, Craig S.; Lepre, Christopher J.; Quinn, Rhonda L.; Mortlock, Richard A.; Wright, James D.; Kent, Dennis V.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Lepre, Christopher J.; Kent, Dennis V.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Prat, Sandrine; Boes, Xavier] CNRS, UPR 2147, Dynam Evolut Humaine, F-75014 Paris, France; [Lenoble, Arnaud; Brenet, Michel] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR PACEA 5199, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Quinn, Rhonda L.] Seton Hall Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Brenet, Michel] Ctr Mixte Rech Archeol, Inrap, F-24620 Campagne, France; [Clement, Sophie] Inrap, F-93120 La Courneuve, France; [Daver, Guillaume] Univ Poitiers, Inst Paleoprimatol Paleontol Humaine Evolut & Pal, CNRS, UMR 7262, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France; [Brugal, Jean-Philip] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, MCC, UMR 7269,LAMPEA, F-13094 Aix En Provence 2, France; [Kirwa, Christopher] Natl Museums Kenya, Dept Earth Sci, Archaeol Sect, Nairobi, Kenya","Harmand, S (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Turkana Basin Inst, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",sonia.harmand@stonybrook.edu; jason.lewis@stonybrook.edu,,"Lewis, Jason/0000-0001-8325-1128; Kent, Dennis/0000-0002-7677-2993","French Ministry of Foreign Affairs [681/DGM/ATT/RECH, 986/DGM/DPR/PRG]; French National Research Agency [ANR-12-CULT-0006]; Fondation Fyssen; National Geographic Society (Expeditions Council) [EC0569-12]; Rutgers University Research Council; Center for Human Evolutionary Studies; INTM Indigo Group France","We thank the office of the President of Kenya, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the National Council for Science and Technology (NCST/RCD/12B/012/25) and the National Museums of Kenya for permission to conduct research.

Transitory pluripotent cells can be captured at different time points during embryogenesis and maintained as embryonic stem cells or epiblast stem cells in culture. Since ontogenesis is a dynamic process in both space and time, it seems counterintuitive that these two temporal states represent the full spectrum of organismal pluripotency. Here we show that by modulating culture parameters, a stem-cell type with unique spatial characteristics and distinct molecular and functional features, designated as region-selective pluripotent stem cells (rsPSCs), can be efficiently obtained from mouse embryos and primate pluripotent stem cells, including humans. The ease of culturing and editing the genome of human rsPSCs offers advantages for regenerative medicine applications. The unique ability of human rsPSCs to generate post-implantation interspecies chimaeric embryos may facilitate our understanding of early human development and evolution.","[Wu, Jun; Okamura, Daiji; Li, Mo; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Ma, Li; Li, Zhongwei; Tamura, Isao; Krause, Marie N.; Hishida, Tomoaki; Takahashi, Yuta; Aizawa, Emi; Kim, Na Young; Esteban, Concepcion Rodriguez; Belmonte, Juan Carlos Izpisua] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Luo, Chongyuan; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Luo, Chongyuan; He, Yupeng; Nery, Joseph R.; Zhang, Zhuzhu; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Benner, Chris] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Integrated Genom, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Du, Tingting; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hishida, Tomoaki] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba Adv Res Alliance, Life Sci Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Lajara, Jeronimo; Guillen, Pedro] Univ Catolica, Med, Guadalupe 30107, Spain; [Guillen, Pedro] Fdn Pedro Guillen, Clin Cemtro, Madrid 28035, Spain; [Campistol, Josep M.] Hosp Clin Barcelona, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Ross, Pablo J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Saghatelian, Alan] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",belmonte@salk.edu,"Ecker, Joseph/B-9144-2008","Ecker, Joseph/0000-0001-5799-5895; Wu, Jun/0000-0001-9863-1668; Lajara Blesa, Jeronimo/0000-0003-1859-8998",California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Training Grant; UCAM; Fundacion Pedro Guillen; G.

Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances(4-6), the nature of their progenitors remains mysterious(3). One of the leading progenitor models, called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion(3,7,8). Here we report observations with the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the supernova and a companion star(9), and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel.","[Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, S.

Models predict(2) that the interaction of supernova ejecta with a companion star or circumstellar debris lead to a sudden brightening lasting from hours to days. Here we present data for three supernovae that are likely to be type Ia observed during the Kepler mission(3) with a time resolution of 30 minutes.

For mechanical oscillators these have primarily been realized using coherent wavepackets, for which the distinguishability arises as a result of the spatial separation of the superposed states(3-5). Here we demonstrate superpositions composed of squeezed wavepackets, which we generate by applying an internal-state-dependent force to a single trapped ion initialized in a squeezed vacuum state with nine decibel reduction in the quadrature variance. This allows us to characterize the initial squeezed wavepacket by monitoring the onset of spin-motion entanglement, and to verify the evolution of the number states of the oscillator as a function of the duration of the force. In both cases we observe clear differences between displacements aligned with the squeezed and anti-squeezed axes. We observe coherent revivals when inverting the state-dependent force after separating the wavepackets by more than 19 times the ground-state root mean squared extent, which corresponds to 56 times the root mean squared extent of the squeezed wavepacket along the displacement direction. Aside from their fundamental nature, these states may be useful for quantum metrology(6) or quantum information processing with continuous variables(7-9).","[Lo, Hsiang-Yu; Kienzler, Daniel; de Clercq, Ludwig; Marinelli, Matteo; Negnevitsky, Vlad; Keitch, Ben C.; Home, Jonathan P.] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Lo, HY (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, Otto Stern Weg 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",hylo@phys.ethz.ch; jhome@phys.ethz.ch,,"Home, Jonathan/0000-0002-4093-1550",Swiss National Science Foundation [200021 134776]; National Centre of Competence in Research for Quantum Science and Technology (QSIT),"We thank J.

The hallmark of Joulian magnetostriction is volume conservation(2), which is a broader definition applicable to self-accommodation of ferromagnetic, ferroelectric or ferroelastic domains in all functional materials(3-10). Here we report the discovery of 'giant' non-volume-conserving or non-Joulian magnetostriction (NJM). Whereas Joulian strain is caused by magnetization rotation, NJM is caused by facile (low-field) reorientation of magnetoelastically and magnetostatically autarkic (self-sufficient) rigid micro-'cells', which define the adaptive structure, the origin of which is proposed to be elastic gradients ultimately caused by charge/spin density waves(11-13). The equilibrium adaptive cellular structure is responsible for long-sought non-dissipative (hysteresis-free), linearly reversible and isotropic magnetization curves along all directions within a single crystal. Recently discovered Fe-based high magnetostriction alloys(14,15) with special thermal history are identified as the first members of this newly discovered magnetic class. The NJM paradigm provides consistent interpretations of seemingly confounding properties of Fe-based alloys, offers recipes to develop new highly magnetostrictive materials, and permits simultaneously large actuation in longitudinal and transverse directions without the need for stacked composites.","[Chopra, Harsh Deep] Temple Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Quantum Mat & Devices, Mat Genom Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Chopra, Harsh Deep] Temple Univ, Temple Mat Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Wuttig, Manfred] Univ Maryland, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Chopra, HD (reprint author), Temple Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Quantum Mat & Devices, Mat Genom Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",chopra@temple.edu; wuttig@umd.edu,,,"National Science Foundation DMR-Metals grant [1206397]; National Science Foundation DMR-Condensed Matter Physics grants [1541236, 0964830]","The authors appreciate the donation of single crystals by T.

In the absence of selection, polymorphisms are expected to be a randomsubset of new mutations; thus, comparing the effects of polymorphisms and new mutations provides a test for selection(1-4). When evidence of selection exists, such comparisons can identify properties of mutations that are most likely to persist in natural populations(2). Here we investigate how mutation and selection have shaped variation in a cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression by empirically determining the effects of polymorphisms segregating in the TDH3 promoter among 85 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comparing their effects to a distribution of mutational effects defined by 236 point mutations in the same promoter. Surprisingly, we find that selection on expression noise (that is, variability in expression among genetically identical cells(5)) appears to have had a greater impact on sequence variation in the TDH3 promoter than selection on mean expression level. This is not necessarily because variation in expression noise impacts fitness more than variation in mean expression level, but rather because of differences in the distributions of mutational effects for these two phenotypes. This study shows how systematically examining the effects of new mutations can enrich our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. It also provides rare empirical evidence of selection acting on expression noise.","[Metzger, Brian P.

Projections from the auditory cortex to the auditory striatum carry information that drives decisions in an auditory frequency discrimination task(1). To assess the role of these projections in learning, we developed a channelrhodopsin-2-based assay to probe selectively for synaptic plasticity associated with corticostriatal neurons representing different frequencies. Here we report that learning this auditory discrimination preferentially potentiates corticostriatal synapses from neurons representing either high or low frequencies, depending on reward contingencies. We observe frequency-dependent corticostriatal potentiation in vivo over the course of training, and in vitro in striatal brain slices. Our findings suggest a model in which the corticostriatal synapses made by neurons tuned to different features of the sound are selectively potentiated to enable the learned transformation of sound into action.","[Xiong, Qiaojie; Znamenskiy, Petr; Zador, Anthony M.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Znamenskiy, Petr] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Zador, AM (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",zador@cshl.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01DC012565, R01NS088649]; Swartz Foundation","We thank B.

Despite recent reports claiming substantially increased reprogramming efficiencies using genetically modified donor cells(12,13), prospectively isolating distinct reprogramming intermediates remains an important goal to decipher reprogramming mechanisms. Previous attempts to identify surface markers of intermediate cell populations were based on the assumption that, during reprogramming, cells progressively lose donor cell identity and gradually acquire iPS cell properties(1,2,7,8,10). Here we report that iPS cell and epithelial markers, such as SSEA1 and EpCAM, respectively, are not predictive of reprogramming during early phases. Instead, in a systematic functional surface marker screen, we find that early reprogramming-prone cells express a unique set of surface markers, including CD73, CD49d and CD200, that are absent in both fibroblasts and iPS cells. Single-cell mass cytometry and prospective isolation show that these distinct intermediates are transient and bridge the gap between donor cell silencing and pluripotency marker acquisition during the early, presumably stochastic, reprogramming phase(2). Expression profiling reveals early upregulation of the transcriptional regulators Nr0b1 and Etv5 in this reprogramming state, preceding activation of key pluripotency regulators such asRex1 (also known as Zfp42), Dppa2, Nanog and Sox2. Both factors are required for the generation of the early intermediate state and fully reprogrammed iPS cells, and thus represent some of the earliest known regulators of iPS cell induction. Our study deconvolutes the first steps in a hierarchical series of events that lead to pluripotency acquisition.","[Lujan, Ernesto; Ng, Yi Han; Goronzy, Isabel N.; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lujan, Ernesto] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lujan, Ernesto; Ng, Yi Han; Goronzy, Isabel N.; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zunder, Eli R.; Nolan, Garry P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baxter Lab Stem Cell Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ng, Yi Han] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wernig, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wernig@stanford.edu,,,California Institute of Regenerative Medicine [RB2-01592]; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford; New York Stem Cell Foundation-Robertson Investigator Award; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Predoctoral Fellowship [TG2-01159]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-114747]; National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award [F32 GM093508-01],"We thank P.

In similar to 25% of cases, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells carry the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase (Philadelphia chromosome positive), which mimics constitutively active pre-BCR signalling(4,5). Current therapeutic approaches are largely focused on the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to suppress oncogenic signalling below a minimum threshold for survival(6). We tested the hypothesis that targeted hyperactivation-above a maximum threshold-will engage a deletional checkpoint for removal of self-reactive B cells and selectively kill ALL cells. Here we find, by testing various components of proximal pre-BCR signalling in mouse BCR-ABL1 cells, that an incremental increase of Syk tyrosine kinase activity was required and sufficient to induce cell death. Hyperactive Syk was functionally equivalent to acute activation of a self-reactive BCR on ALL cells. Despite oncogenic transformation, this basic mechanism of negative selection was still functional in ALL cells. Unlike normal pre-B cells, patient-derived ALL cells express the inhibitory receptors PECAM1, CD300A and LAIR1 at high levels. Genetic studies revealed that Pecam1, Cd300a and Lair1 are critical to calibrate oncogenic signalling strength through recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatases Ptpn6 (ref. 7) and Inpp5d (ref. 8). Using a novel small-molecule inhibitor of INPP5D (also known as SHIP1)(9), we demonstrated that pharmacological hyperactivation of SYK and engagement of negative B-cell selection represents a promising new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.","[Chen, Zhengshan; Shojaee, Seyedmehdi; Buchner, Maike; Geng, Huimin; Lee, JaeWoong; Klemm, Lars; Park, Eugene; Lowell, Clifford A.; Mueschen, Markus] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Titz, Boern; Graeber, Thomas G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Crump Inst Mol Imaging, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tan, Ying Xim; Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med,Div Rheumatol, Rosalind Russell Ephraim P Engleman Med Res Ctr A, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Satterthwaite, Anne] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Paietta, Elisabeth] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Bronx, NY 10466 USA; [Hunger, Stephen P.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Pediat Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hunger, Stephen P.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Childhood Canc Res, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Willman, Cheryl L.] Univ New Mexico, Ctr Canc, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA; [Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Loh, Mignon L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Pediat Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Jung, Jae U.] Univ So Calif, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Coligan, John E.] NIAID, Receptor Cell Biol Sect, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Bolland, Silvia] NIAID, Autoimmun & Funct Genom Sect, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Mak, Tak W.] Univ Hlth Network, Campbell Family Inst Breast Canc Res, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Limnander, Andre] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Clin Ulm, Inst Immunol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, BIOSS Ctr Biol Signalling Studies, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Reth, Michael] MPI Immunbiol & Epigenet, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Muschen, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",markus.muschen@ucsf.edu,"Titz, Bjoern/G-6317-2017","Titz, Bjoern/0000-0003-4414-4105; Graeber, Thomas/0000-0001-8574-9181","National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute [R01CA137060, R01CA139032, R01CA169458, R01CA172558, R01CA157644]; ECOG-ACRIN [CA180820, CA180794]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [TR02-1816]; William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; DFG [EXC294, TRR130, SFB746]","We thank R.

Following injury, culture or transplantation, stem cells outside their niche often display fate flexibility(1-4). Here we show that super-enhancers(5) underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. Using hair follicle as a model, we map the global chromatin domains of hair follicle stem cells and their committed progenitors in their native microenvironments. We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. We further show that when outside their niche, either in vitro or in wound-repair, hair follicle stem cells dynamically remodel super-enhancers in response to changes in their microenvironment. Intriguingly, some key super-enhancers shift epicentres, enabling their genes to remain active and maintain a transitional state in an ever-changing transcriptional landscape. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.","[Adam, Rene C.; Yang, Hanseul; Larsen, Samantha B.; Nikolova, Maria; Oristian, Daniel S.; Polak, Lisa; Kadaja, Meelis; Asare, Amma; Fuchs, Elaine] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mammalian Cell Biol & Dev, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rockowitz, Shira; Zheng, Deyou] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Genet, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zheng, Deyou] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zheng, Deyou] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Fuchs, E (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mammalian Cell Biol & Dev, New York, NY 10065 USA.",fuchslb@rockefeller.edu,,"Zheng, Deyou/0000-0003-4354-5337","Anderson Cancer Center Graduate Student Fellowship; National Institutes of Health [R01-AR31737, R21MH099452]","We thank S.

However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing(1,2). The extent to which recursive splicing occurs in other species and its mechanistic basis have not been examined. Here we identify highly conserved RS-sites in genes expressed in the mammalian brain that encode proteins functioning in neuronal development. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates. We find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of an 'RS-exon' that follows the RS-site. The RS-exon is then excluded from the dominant mRNA isoform owing to competition with a reconstituted 59 splice site formed at the RS-site after the first splicing step. Conversely, the RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic promoters or exons that fail to reconstitute an efficient 59 splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon such that their inclusion can decrease mRNA stability. Thus, by establishing a binary splicing switch, RS-sites demarcate different mRNA isoforms emerging from long genes by coupling cryptic elements with inclusion of RS-exons.","[Sibley, Christopher R.; Blazquez, Lorea; Haberman, Nejc; Trabzuni, Daniah; Ryten, Mina; Hardy, John; Ule, Jernej] UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Mol Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Sibley, Christopher R.; Briese, Michael; Modic, Miha; Ule, Jernej] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Emmett, Warren; Plagnol, Vincent] UCL, Genet Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Faro, Ana; Wilson, Stephen W.] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Briese, Michael] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Clin Neurobiol, D-97078 Wurzburg, Germany; [Trabzuni, Daniah] King Faisal Specialist Hosp & Res Ctr, Dept Genet, Riyadh 11211, Saudi Arabia; [Ryten, Mina; Weale, Michael E.] Kings Coll London, Guys Hosp, Dept Med & Mol Genet, London SE1 9RT, England; [Modic, Miha] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Stem Cell Res, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Curk, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Ule, J (reprint author), UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Mol Neurosci, Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",v.plagnol@ucl.ac.uk; j.ule@ucl.ac.uk,"Hardy, John/C-2451-2009; Zebrafish, UCL/A-3125-2009; Wilson, Stephen/B-9404-2008; Weale, Michael/F-2587-2010; Ule, Jernej/C-6315-2013","Wilson, Stephen/0000-0002-8557-5940; Sibley, Christopher/0000-0002-8286-4683; Blazquez Garcia, Lorea/0000-0003-2885-3286; Weale, Michael/0000-0003-4593-1186; Ule, Jernej/0000-0002-2452-4277; Modic, Miha/0000-0002-2894-7218; Plagnol, Vincent/0000-0002-5597-9215","European Research Council [206726-CLIP, 617837-Translate]; Marie Curie Post-doctoral Research Fellowship (627783-NeuroCRYSP); Slovenian Research Agency [J7-5460]; UK NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital; UCL Institute of Ophthalmology; Wellcome Trust; UK Medical Research Council (MRC) [U105185858]; MRC [G0901254, G0802462]; MRC Sudden Death Brain Bank","We thank S.

Here we identify 197 zero nucleotide exon ratchet points in 130 introns of 115 Drosophila genes from total RNA sequencing data generated from developmental time points, dissected tissues and cultured cells. The sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet points. We also show that recursive splicing is a constitutive process, that depletion of U2AF inhibits recursive splicing, and that the sequence and function of ratchet points are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila. Finally, we identify four recursively spliced human genes, one of which is also recursively spliced in Drosophila.

Our results provide strong support for hypotheses in which the eukaryotic host evolved from a bona fide archaeon, and demonstrate that many components that underpin eukaryote-specific features were already present in that ancestor.

We examined motivational characteristics of two separate neuron populations that regulate energy and fluid homeostasis by using cell-type-specific activity manipulations in mice. We found that starvation-sensitive AGRP neurons exhibit properties consistent with a negative-valence teaching signal. Mice avoided activation of AGRP neurons, indicating that AGRP neuron activity has negative valence. AGRP neuron inhibition conditioned preference for flavours and places. Correspondingly, deep-brain calcium imaging revealed that AGRP neuron activity rapidly reduced in response to food-related cues. Complementary experiments activating thirst-promoting neurons also conditioned avoidance. Therefore, these need-sensing neurons condition preference for environmental cues associated with nutrient or water ingestion, which is learned through reduction of negative-valence signals during restoration of homeostasis.","[Betley, J.

In mammalian brains, head direction cells integrate these two streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory.

The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows(1-6) or stripping(7-9) is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called ""strangulation''(10-14), in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10(11) solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10(11) solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.","[Peng, Y.; Maiolino, R.; Cochrane, R.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Peng, Y.; Maiolino, R.] Univ Cambridge, Kavli Inst Cosmol, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Cochrane, R.] Royal Observ, Inst Astron, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, Midlothian, Scotland","Peng, Y (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, 19 JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",yp244@mrao.cam.ac.uk,,"Cochrane, Rachel/0000-0001-8855-6107",,,,41,88.0,89,1.0,9.0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-May,2015.0,521.0,7551.0,,,,,192,+,,10.1038/nature14439,,11.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CH9SY,WOS:000354377800052,25971510.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,r.,cochrane,na,na,na,na,na

It exhibits an extremely low carrier density threshold for superconductivity(2), and possesses a phase diagram similar to that of high-temperature superconductors(3,4)-two factors that suggest an unconventional pairing mechanism. Despite sustained interest for 50 years, direct experimental insight into the nature of electron pairing in SrTiO3 has remained elusive. Here we perform transport experiments with nanowire-based single-electron transistors at the interface between SrTiO3 and a thin layer of lanthanum aluminate, LaAlO3. Electrostatic gating reveals a series of two-electron conductance resonances-paired electron states-that bifurcate above a critical pairing field B-p of about 1-4 tesla, an order of magnitude larger than the superconducting critical magnetic field. For magnetic fields below B-p, these resonances are insensitive to the applied magnetic field; for fields in excess of B-p, the resonances exhibit a linear Zeeman-like energy splitting. Electron pairing is stable at temperatures as high as 900 millikelvin, well above the superconducting transition temperature (about 300 millikelvin). These experiments demonstrate the existence of a robust electronic phase in which electrons pair without forming a superconducting state. Key experimental signatures are captured by a model involving an attractive Hubbard interaction that describes real-space electron pairing as a precursor to superconductivity.","[Cheng, Guanglei; Tomczyk, Michelle; Lu, Shicheng; Veazey, Joshua P.; Huang, Mengchen; Irvin, Patrick; Levy, Jeremy] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Phys & Astron, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Cheng, Guanglei; Tomczyk, Michelle; Lu, Shicheng; Huang, Mengchen; Irvin, Patrick; Levy, Jeremy] Pittsburgh Quantum Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Ryu, Sangwoo; Lee, Hyungwoo; Eom, Chang-Beom] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hellberg, C.

The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography(2,3). In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical nearfields(4-9) to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multi-level quantum ladder is obtained(10), representing the observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk'(5) coherently reshaping electron density in momentum space(11). We note that, after the interaction, the optically generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers.","[Feist, Armin; Echternkamp, Katharina E.; Schauss, Jakob; Yalunin, Sergey V.; Schaefer, Sascha; Ropers, Claus] Univ Gottingen, Inst Phys 4, Solids & Nanostruct, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Schafer, S (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Phys 4, Solids & Nanostruct, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",schaefer@ph4.physik.uni-goettingen.de; cropers@gwdg.de,"Ropers, Claus/D-4843-2015; Feist, Armin/K-3050-2017","Ropers, Claus/0000-0002-9539-3817; Feist, Armin/0000-0003-1434-8895; Priebe, Katharina/0000-0002-1808-3188",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG-SFB 1073]; VolkswagenStiftung; Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture,"We thank M.

On geological timescales, the balance between sequestration of POC from the terrestrial biosphere and oxidation of rock-derived (petrogenic) organic carbon sets the magnitude of the atmospheric carbon and oxygen reservoirs(6,7). Over shorter timescales, variations in the rate of exchange between carbon reservoirs, such as soils and marine sediments, also modulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels(1). The respective fluxes of biospheric and petrogenic organic carbon are poorly constrained, however, and mechanisms controlling POC export have remained elusive, limiting our ability to predict POC fluxes quantitatively as a result of climatic or tectonic changes. Here we estimate biospheric and petrogenic POC fluxes for a suite of river systems representative of the natural variability in catchment properties. We show that export yields of both biospheric and petrogenic POC are positively related to the yield of suspended sediment, revealing that POC export is mostly controlled by physical erosion. Using a global compilation of gauged suspended sediment flux, we derive separate estimates of global biospheric and petrogenic POC fluxes of 157(-50)(+74) and 43(-25)(+61) megatonnes of carbon per year, respectively. We find that biospheric POC export is primarily controlled by the capacity of rivers to mobilize and transport POC, and is largely insensitive to the magnitude of terrestrial primary production. Globally, physical erosion rates affect the rate of biospheric POC burial in marine sediments more strongly than carbon sequestration through silicate weathering. We conclude that burial of biospheric POC in marine sediments becomes the dominant long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide sink under enhanced physical erosion.","[Galy, Valier; Peucker-Ehrenbrink, Bernhard; Eglinton, Timothy] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Eglinton, Timothy] ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Galy, V (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, 360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",vgaly@whoi.edu,"galy, valier/I-6185-2012","Peucker-Ehrenbrink, Bernhard/0000-0002-3819-992X",US National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0851015]; NSF [OCE-0928582]; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_140850],"We thank Y.

This process is largely dependent on microbial responses, but we know little about microbial activity in intact, let alone in thawing, permafrost. Molecular approaches have recently revealed the identities and functional gene composition of microorganismsin some permafrost soils(2-4) and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw experiments(3). However, the fate of permafrost carbon depends on climatic, hydrological and microbial responses to thaw at decadal scales(5,6). Here we use the combination of several molecular 'omics' approaches to determine the phylogenetic composition of the microbial communities, including several draft genomes of novel species, their functional potential and activity in soils representing different states of thaw: intact permafrost, seasonally thawed active layer and thermokarst bog. The multi-omics strategy reveals a good correlation of process rates to omics data for dominant processes, such as methanogenesis in the bog, as well as novel survival strategies for potentially active microbes in permafrost.","[Hultman, Jenni; David, Maude M.; Jansson, Janet K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Waldrop, Mark P.; McFarland, Jack; Blazewicz, Steven J.; Harden, Jennifer] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Mackelprang, Rachel] Calif State Univ Northridge, Biol Dept, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Mackelprang, Rachel; Mavrommatis, Kostas; Jansson, Janet K.] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Turetsky, Merritt R.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [McGuire, A.

In plants, however, the molecular mechanisms of how signal perception is transduced to MAPK activation remain elusive(1). Here we report that pathogen-secreted proteases activate a previously unknown signalling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana involving the G alpha, G beta, and G gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G-protein complexes, which function upstream of an MAPK cascade. In this pathway, receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) functions as a novel scaffold that binds to the G beta subunit as well as to all three tiers of the MAPK cascade, thereby linking upstream G-protein signalling to downstream activation of an MAPK cascade. The protease-G-protein-RACK1-MAPK cascade modules identified in these studies are distinct from previously described plant immune signalling pathways such as that elicited by bacterial flagellin, in which G proteins function downstream of or in parallel to an MAPK cascade without the involvement of the RACK1 scaffolding protein. The discovery of the new protease-mediated immune signalling pathway described here was facilitated by the use of the broad host range, opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ability of P. aeruginosa to infect both plants and animals makes it an excellent model to identify novel immunoregulatory strategies that account for its niche adaptation to diverse host tissues and immune systems.","[Cheng, Zhenyu; Li, Jian-Feng; Niu, Yajie; Zhang, Xue-Cheng; Xiong, Yan; Djonovic, Slavica; Millet, Yves; Bush, Jenifer; Sheen, Jen; Ausubel, Frederick M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Cheng, Zhenyu; Li, Jian-Feng; Niu, Yajie; Zhang, Xue-Cheng; Xiong, Yan; Djonovic, Slavica; Millet, Yves; Bush, Jenifer; Sheen, Jen; Ausubel, Frederick M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Woody, Owen Z.; McConkey, Brendan J.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Ausubel, FM (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ausubel@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships; National Science Foundation [MCB-0519898, IOS-0929226, IOS-0618292]; National Institutes of Health [R37-GM48707, P30 DK040561, R01-GM70567]","We thank G.

For example, vision requires the lens to be centred in the eye cup which must in turn be correctly positioned in the head(1). Tissue morphogenesis depends on force generation, force transmission through the tissue, and response of tissues and extracellular matrix to force(2,3). Although a century ago D'Arcy Thompson postulated that terrestrial animal body shapes are conditioned by gravity(4), there has been no animal model directly demonstrating how the aforementioned mechano-morphogenetic processes are coordinated to generate a body shape that withstands gravity. Here we report a unique medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) mutant, hirame (hir), which is sensitive to deformation by gravity. hir embryos display a markedly flattened body caused by mutation of YAP, a nuclear executor of Hippo signalling that regulates organ size. We show that actomyosin-mediated tissue tension is reduced in hir embryos, leading to tissue flattening and tissue misalignment, both of which contribute to body flattening. By analysing YAP function in 3D spheroids of human cells, we identify the Rho GTPase activating protein ARHGAP18 as an effector of YAP in controlling tissue tension. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognised function of YAP in regulating tissue shape and alignment required for proper 3D body shape.

The discovery that psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease has led to more targeted, effective therapies; recent advances have focused on the interleukin (IL)-12/23p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23. Evidence suggests that specific inhibition of IL-23 would result in improvement in psoriasis. Here we evaluate tildrakizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-23p19 subunit, in a three-part, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential, rising multiple-dose phase I study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to provide clinical proof that specific targeting of IL-23p19 results in symptomatic improvement of disease severity in human subjects. A 75% reduction in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score (PASI75) was achieved by all subjects in parts 1 and 3 (pooled) in the 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) groups by day 196. In part 2, 10 out of 15 subjects in the 3 mg kg(-1) group and 13 out of 14 subjects in the 10 mg kg(-1) group achieved a PASI75 by day 112.

However, the reason why the virus selects only certain genes among all transcriptionally active regions in a target cell remains largely unknown. Here we show that HIV-1 integration occurs in the outer shell of the nucleus in close correspondence with the nuclear pore. This region contains a series of cellular genes, which are preferentially targeted by the virus, and characterized by the presence of active transcription chromatin marks before viral infection. In contrast, the virus strongly disfavours the heterochromatic regions in the nuclear lamin-associated domains(5) and other transcriptionally active regions located centrally in the nucleus. Functional viral integrase and the presence of the cellular Nup153 and LEDGF/p75 integration cofactors are indispensable for the peripheral integration of the virus. Once integrated at the nuclear pore, the HIV-1 DNA makes contact with various nucleoporins; this association takes part in the transcriptional regulation of the viral genome. These results indicate that nuclear topography is an essential determinant of the HIV-1 life cycle.","[Marini, Bruna; Ali, Hashim; Lucic, Bojana; Lisek, Kamil; Manganaro, Lara; Giacca, Mauro; Lusic, Marina] Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Kertesz-Farkas, Attila; Pongor, Sandor] Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Prot Struct & Bioinformat Grp, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Luzzati, Roberto] Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Malattie Infett, I-34134 Trieste, Italy; [Luzzati, Roberto; Giacca, Mauro] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Surg & Hlth Sci, I-34129 Trieste, Italy; [Recchia, Alessandra; Mavilio, Fulvio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Life Sci, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Mavilio, Fulvio] Genethon, F-91002 Evry, France","Giacca, M (reprint author), Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy.",giacca@icgeb.org; marina.lusic@med.uni-heidelberg.de,"Giacca, Mauro/J-9287-2016","Giacca, Mauro/0000-0003-2927-7225; Lisek, Kamil/0000-0002-2406-8830; Manganaro, Lara/0000-0003-2743-2658","Italian National Research Programme on AIDS of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Italy; Italian Ministry of Health [RF2007-16]","This work was supported by grants from the Italian National Research Programme on AIDS of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Italy, to M.G. and M.L. and from the Young Investigator Grant RF2007-16 of the Italian Ministry of Health to M.L.

One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome during development in female mammals(3,4). Despite extensive efforts to define the mechanism of Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins required for this role(3). The main challenge is that there are currently no methods to comprehensively define the proteins that directly interact with a lncRNA in the cell(5). Here we develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify ten proteins that specifically associate with Xist, three of these proteins-SHARP, SAF-A and LBR-are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing. We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor(6) that activates HDAC3(7), is not only essential for silencing, but is also required for the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and HDAC3 are also required for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to silencing transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the X chromosome. Our results suggest that Xist silences transcription by directly interacting with SHARP, recruiting SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude Pol II across the X chromosome.","[McHugh, Colleen A.; Chen, Chun-Kan; Chow, Amy; Surka, Christine F.; Tran, Christina; Blanco, Mario; Burghard, Christina; Shishkin, Alexander A.; Su, Julia; Guttman, Mitchell] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [McDonel, Patrick; Lander, Eric S.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pandya-Jones, Amy; Plath, Kathrin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Biol Chem, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Pandya-Jones, Amy; Plath, Kathrin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Moradian, Annie; Sweredoski, Michael J.; Hess, Sonja] CALTECH, Beckman Inst, Proteome Explorat Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Guttman, M (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",mguttman@caltech.edu,,"Plath, Kathrin/0000-0001-7796-3372","Caltech; NIH NRSA [T32GM07616]; Caltech Beckman Institute; Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF775]; Beckman Institute; NIH [1S10RR029591-01A1, DP5OD012190]; Rose Hills Foundation; Edward Mallinckrodt Foundation; Sontag Foundation; Searle Scholars Program; California Institute of Technology","We thank J.

F-type ATP synthases use the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate ATP by rotary catalysis. Protons moving across the membrane drive a rotor ring composed of 8-15 c-subunits(1). A central stalk transmits the rotation of the c-ring to the catalytic F-1 head, where a series of conformational changes results in ATP synthesis(2). A key unresolved question in this fundamental process is how protons pass through the membrane to drive ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthases form V-shaped homodimers in cristae membranes(3). Here we report the structure of a native and active mitochondrial ATP synthase dimer, determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at 6.2 angstrom resolution. Our structure shows four long, horizontal membrane-intrinsic alpha-helices in the a-subunit, arranged in two hairpins at an angle of approximately 70 degrees relative to the c-ring helices. It has been proposed that a strictly conserved membrane-embedded arginine in the a-subunit couples proton translocation to c-ring rotation(4). A fit of the conserved carboxy-terminal a-subunit sequence places the conserved arginine next to a proton-binding c-subunit glutamate. The map shows a slanting solvent-accessible channel that extends from the mitochondrial matrix to the conserved arginine. Another hydrophilic cavity on the lumenal membrane surface defines a direct route for the protons to an essential histidine-glutamate pair(5). Our results provide unique new insights into the structure and function of rotary ATP synthases and explain how ATP production is coupled to proton translocation.","[Allegretti, Matteo; Klusch, Niklas; Mills, Deryck J.; Vonck, Janet; Kuehlbrandt, Werner; Davies, Karen M.] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Struct Biol, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Kuhlbrandt, W (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Struct Biol, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",werner.kuehlbrandt@biophys.mpg.de; karen.davies@biophys.mpg.de,"Allegretti, Matteo/B-7030-2016","Allegretti, Matteo/0000-0002-9542-7482; Kuhlbrandt, Werner/0000-0002-2013-4810",Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence Frankfurt 'Macromolecular Complexes',"We thank T.

ATP hydrolysis in the soluble catalytic region of the enzyme is coupled to proton translocation through the membrane-bound region by rotation of a central rotor subcomplex, with peripheral stalks preventing the entire membrane-bound region from turning with the rotor. The eukaryotic V-ATPase is the most complex rotary ATPase: it has three peripheral stalks, a hetero-oligomeric proton-conducting proteolipid ring, several subunits not found in other rotary ATPases, and is regulated by reversible dissociation of its catalytic and proton-conducting regions(1,2). Studies of ATP synthases, V-ATPases, and bacterial/archaeal V/A-ATPases have suggested that flexibility is necessary for the catalytic mechanism of rotary ATPases(3-5), but the structures of different rotational states have never been observed experimentally. Here we use electron cryomicroscopy to obtain structures for three rotational states of the V-ATPase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting series of structures shows ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, setting the ATP: H+ ratio for proton pumping by the V-ATPase at 3: 10, and reveals long and highly tilted transmembrane alpha-helices in the a-subunit that interact with the c-ring. The three different maps reveal the conformational changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble catalytic region to the membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of the subunits of the enzyme undergo conformational changes during the transitions between these three rotational states. The structures of these states provide direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth transmission of power through rotary ATPases.","[Zhao, Jianhua; Benlekbir, Samir; Rubinstein, John L.] Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Mol Struct & Funct Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Zhao, Jianhua; Rubinstein, John L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, MaRS Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Rubinstein, John L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Rubinstein, JL (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Mol Struct & Funct Program, 686 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.",john.rubinstein@utoronto.ca,,"Rubinstein, John/0000-0003-0566-2209; Zhao, Jianhua/0000-0002-4997-766X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Mary Gertrude l'Anson Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 81294],"We thank P.

Mutant organoids can be selected by removing individual growth factors from the culture medium. Quadruple mutants grow independently of all stem-cell-niche factors and tolerate the presence of the P53 stabilizer nutlin-3. Upon xenotransplantation into mice, quadruple mutants grow as tumours with features of invasive carcinoma.

Since the positively charged Schiff base proton, located within the ion-conducting pathway of all light-driven ion pumps, was thought to prohibit the transport of a non-proton cation, the discovery of KR2 raised the question of how it achieves Na+ transport. Here we present crystal structures of KR2 under neutral and acidic conditions, which represent the resting and M-like intermediate states, respectively. Structural and spectroscopic analyses revealed the gating mechanism, whereby the flipping of Asp116 sequesters the Schiff base proton from the conducting pathway to facilitate Na+ transport. Together with the structure-based engineering of the first light-driven K1 pumps, electrophysiological assays in mammalian neurons and behavioural assays in a nematode, our studies reveal the molecular basis for light-driven non-proton cation pumps and thus provide a framework that may advance the development of next-generation optogenetics.","[Kato, Hideaki E.; Kunitomo, Hirofumi; Takemoto, Mizuki; Nishizawa, Tomohiro; Taniguchi, Reiya; Iino, Yuichi; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Inoue, Keiichi; Abe-Yoshizumi, Rei; Kato, Yoshitaka; Ono, Hikaru; Konno, Masae; Kandori, Hideki] Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Frontier Mat, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Inoue, Keiichi; Kandori, Hideki] Nagoya Inst Technol, OptoBioTechnol Res Ctr, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Inoue, Keiichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Hososhima, Shoko; Ishizuka, Toru; Hoque, Mohammad Razuanul; Yawo, Hiromu] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Dev Biol & Neurosci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Hososhima, Shoko; Ishizuka, Toru; Hoque, Mohammad Razuanul; Iino, Yuichi; Yawo, Hiromu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ito, Jumpei] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Dept Bioengn Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yoshizawa, Susumu; Kogure, Kazuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Yamashita, Keitaro] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",kandori@nitech.ac.jp; nureki@bs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yawo, Hiromu/I-4871-2015; IINO, YUICHI/G-4962-2014; Ishizuka, Toru/L-8191-2017","Yawo, Hiromu/0000-0002-4299-3288; Ishizuka, Toru/0000-0003-4405-8792; Ito, Jumpei/0000-0001-5149-9962; Kato, Hideaki/0000-0002-1941-5535; yoshizawa, susumu/0000-0001-9667-6010; Takemoto, Mizuki/0000-0002-6339-6431","Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics and Structural Life Science, of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); JSPS KAKENHI [11J06643, 24115508, 24655009, 25104009, 24681003, 24227004, 25291011]; FIRST program, PRESTO, CREST, JST","We thank M.

However, a clump formation event has not yet been observed, and it is debated whether clumps can survive energetic feedback from young stars, and afterwards migrate inwards to form galaxy bulges(9-12). Here we report the spatially resolved spectroscopy of a bright off-nuclear emission line region in a galaxy at z = 1.987. Although this region dominates star formation in the galaxy disk, its stellar continuum remains undetected in deep imaging, revealing an extremely young (less than ten million years old) massive clump, forming through the gravitational collapse of more than one billion solarmasses of gas. Gas consumption in this young clump is more than tenfold faster than in the host galaxy, displaying high star-formation efficiency during this phase, in agreement with our hydrodynamic simulations. The frequency of older clumps with similar masses(13), coupled with our initial estimate of their formation rate (about 2.5 per billion years), supports long lifetimes (about 500 million years), favouring models in which clumps survive feedback and grow the bulges of present-day galaxies.","[Zanella, A.; Daddi, E.; Le Floc'h, E.; Bournaud, F.; Gobat, R.; Valentino, F.; Strazzullo, V.; Cibinel, A.; Renaud, F.] CEA DSM CNRS Univ Paris Diderot, Lab AIM Paris Saclay, Irfu Serv Astrophys, CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gobat, R.] Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Phys, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Strazzullo, V.] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Cibinel, A.] Univ Sussex, Dept Phys & Astron, Ctr Astron, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Onodera, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Astron, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Perret, V.] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LAM, F-13388 Marseille, France; [Renaud, F.] Univ Surrey, Dept Phys, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Vignali, C.] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Fis & Astron, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Vignali, C.] INAF Osservatorio Astron Bologna, I-40127 Bologna, Italy","Zanella, A (reprint author), CEA DSM CNRS Univ Paris Diderot, Lab AIM Paris Saclay, Irfu Serv Astrophys, CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",anita.zanella@cea.fr,"Vignali, Cristian/J-4974-2012; Daddi, Emanuele/D-1649-2012","Vignali, Cristian/0000-0002-8853-9611; Daddi, Emanuele/0000-0002-3331-9590; Cibinel, Anna/0000-0003-4578-514X","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-12-JS05-0008-01]; European Commission through European Research Council [StG-257720, StG-240039]","We thank S.

These fractures have been shown to be the sources of the observed jets of water vapour and icy particles(1-4) and to exhibit higher temperatures than the surrounding terrain(5,6). Subsequent observations have focused on obtaining close-up imaging of this region to better characterize these emissions. Recent work(7) examined those newer data sets and used triangulation of discrete jets3 to produce maps of jetting activity at various times. Here we show that much of the eruptive activity can be explained by broad, curtain-like eruptions. Optical illusions in the curtain eruptions resulting from a combination of viewing direction and local fracture geometry produce image features that were probably misinterpreted previously as discrete jets. We present maps of the total emission along the fractures, rather than just the jet-like component, for five times during an approximately one-year period in 2009 and 2010.

To provide comparable complexity while operating much faster and with manageable power dissipation, networks(2) based on circuits(3,4) combining complementary metaloxide-semiconductors (CMOSs) and adjustable two-terminal resistive devices (memristors) have been developed. In such circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one(3) or several(4) crossbar layers, with memristors at each crosspoint. There have recently been notable improvements in the fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS circuits(5-12), including first demonstrations(5,6,12) of their vertical integration. Separately, discrete memristors have been used as artificial synapses in neuromorphic networks(13-18). Very recently, such experiments have been extended(19) to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The adjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each crosspoint, and hence these devices are much harder to scale than metal-oxide memristors(11,20,21), whose nonlinear current-voltage curves enable transistor-free operation. Here we report the experimental implementation of transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbars, with device variability sufficiently low to allow operation of integrated neural networks, in a simple network: a single-layer perceptron (an algorithm for linear classification). The network can be taught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta rule algorithm(22) to perform the perfect classification of 3 3 3-pixel black/white images into three classes (representing letters). This demonstration is an important step towards much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic networks.","[Prezioso, M.; Merrikh-Bayat, F.; Hoskins, B. D.; Adam, G. C.; Strukov, D.

Because of their strong vertical and horizontal currents, and the turbulent mixing caused by their breaking, they affect a panoply of ocean processes, such as the supply of nutrients for photosynthesis(1), sediment and pollutant transport(2) and acoustic transmission(3); they also pose hazards for man-made structures in the ocean(4). Generated primarily by the wind and the tides, internal waves can travel thousands of kilometres from their sources before breaking(5), making it challenging to observe them and to include them in numerical climate models, which are sensitive to their effects(6,7). For over a decade, studies(8-11) have targeted the South China Sea, where the oceans' most powerful known internal waves are generated in the Luzon Strait and steepen dramatically as they propagate west. Confusion has persisted regarding their mechanism of generation, variability and energy budget, however, owing to the lack of in situ data from the Luzon Strait, where extreme flow conditions make measurements difficult. Here we use new observations and numerical models to (1) show that the waves begin as sinusoidal disturbances rather than arising from sharp hydraulic phenomena, (2) reveal the existence of >200-metre-high breaking internal waves in the region of generation that give rise to turbulence levels >10,000 times that in the open ocean, (3) determine that the Kuroshio western boundary current noticeably refracts the internal wave field emanating from the Luzon Strait, and (4) demonstrate a factor-of-two agreement between modelled and observed energy fluxes, which allows us to produce an observationally supported energy budget of the region.

Yi is nested phylogenetically among winged theropods but has large stiff filamentous feathers of an unusual type on both the forelimb and hindlimb. However, the filamentous feathers of Yi resemble pinnate feathers in bearing morphologically diverse melanosomes(5). Most surprisingly, Yi has a long rod-like bone extending from each wrist, and patches of membranous tissue preserved between the rod-like bones and the manual digits. Analogous features are unknown in any dinosaur but occur in various flying and gliding tetrapods(6-10), suggesting the intriguing possibility that Yi had membranous aerodynamic surfaces totally different from the archetypal feathered wings of birds and their closest relatives. Documentation of the unique forelimbs of Yi greatly increases the morphological disparity known to exist among dinosaurs, and highlights the extraordinary breadth and richness of the evolutionary experimentation that took place close to the origin of birds.","[Xu, Xing; Zheng, Xiaoting; Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Yan] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276005, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xing; Sullivan, Corwin; O'Connor, Jingmai K.; Zhang, Fucheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaoting; Zhang, Xiaomei] Shandong Tianyu Museum Nat, Pingyi 273300, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Pan, Yanhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Xu, X (reprint author), Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276005, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xingxu@vip.sina.com; ty4291666@163.com,,"Sullivan, Corwin/0000-0002-5488-6797","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41372014, 41472023, 41120124002, 41125008]; Major Basic Research Projects of the Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2012CB821900]","We thank Z.

Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies(1-3). However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants(4). Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure(4,5). Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees' mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.","[Kessler, Sebastien C.; Simcock, Kerry L.; Softley, Samantha; Wright, Geraldine A.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tiedeken, Erin Jo; Stout, Jane C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Derveau, Sophie] Newcastle Univ, Sch Biol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mitchell, Jessica] Univ Oxford, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Oxford OX1 3SR, England","Wright, GA (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",jeri.wright@ncl.ac.uk,"Stout, Jane /B-1631-2010","Stout, Jane /0000-0002-2027-0863",BBSRC; NERC; Wellcome Trust; Defra; Scottish Government under the Insect Pollinators Initiative [BB/I000143/1]; Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2012-708]; Science Foundation Ireland [10/RFP/EOB2842]; US National Science Foundation [2010097514]; Irish Research Council's EMBARK Postgraduate Scholarship Scheme grant [RS/2010/2147],"We thank M.

Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants(5), and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees(6). The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence(7), particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids(8-11). Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes(11-13). Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees(1-3) may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees.","[Rundlof, Maj; Andersson, Georg K.

Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this(2,6-10), but the actual cause is unknown. Here we identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as the basis of this variation. Analysing similar to 17 million single-nucleotide variants from the genomes of 652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to changes in replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating heterochromatin relative to early replicating euchromatin. Thus, differential DNA repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the large-scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome.","[Supek, Fran; Lehner, Ben] CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Supek, Fran; Lehner, Ben] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Supek, Fran] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Elect, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Lehner, Ben] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Lehner, B (reprint author), CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",ben.lehner@crg.eu,"Lehner, Ben/L-3413-2014; Supek, Fran/B-2359-2012","Lehner, Ben/0000-0002-8817-1124; Supek, Fran/0000-0002-7811-6711",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BFU2011-26206]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa) [SEV-2012-0208]; European Research Council Consolidator grant IR-DC [616434]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); EMBO Young Investigator Program; EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; FP7 project 4DCellFate [277899]; FP7 project MAESTRA [ICT-2013-612944]; Marie Curie Actions; ICREA,"This work was supported by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (BFU2011-26206 and 'Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa 2013-2017' SEV-2012-0208), a European Research Council Consolidator grant IR-DC (616434), Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR), the EMBO Young Investigator Program, the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program, FP7 project 4DCellFate (277899), FP7 project MAESTRA (ICT-2013-612944) and by Marie Curie Actions.",,40,61.0,61,6.0,52.0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-May,2015.0,521.0,7550.0,,,,,81,U173,,10.1038/nature14173,,11.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CH4YS,WOS:000354040900037,25707793.0,No,,,11/20/17,ben,lehner,male,0.99,3363,xg8xgV4AAAAJ,5275

Current models postulate that the basal ganglia modulate cerebral cortex indirectly via an inhibitory output to thalamus, bidirectionally controlled by direct-and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively)(2-4). The basal ganglia thalamic output sculpts cortical activity by interacting with signals from sensory and motor systems(5). Here we describe a direct projection from the globus pallidus externus (GP), a central nucleus of the basal ganglia, to frontal regions of the cerebral cortex (FC). Two cell types make up the GP-FC projection, distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, cortical projections and expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a synthetic enzyme for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Despite these differences, ChAT(+) cells, which have been historically identified as an extension of the nucleus basalis, as well asChAT(-) cells, release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (c-aminobutyric acid) and are inhibited by iSPNs and dSPNs of dorsal striatum. Thus, GP-FC cells comprise a direct GABAergic/cholinergic projection under the control of striatum that activates frontal cortex in vivo. Furthermore, iSPN inhibition of GP-FC cells is sensitive to dopamine 2 receptor signalling, revealing a pathway by which drugs that target dopamine receptors for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders can act in the basal ganglia to modulate frontal cortices.","[Saunders, Arpiar; Oldenburg, Ian A.; Berezovskii, Vladimir K.; Johnson, Caroline A.; Sabatini, Bernardo L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kingery, Nathan D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Neurobiol Imaging Facil, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Elliott, Hunter L.; Xie, Tiao] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Image & Data Anal Core, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gerfen, Charles R.] NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Sabatini, BL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bsabatini@hms.harvard.edu,,"Berezovskii, Vladimir/0000-0003-4077-3940","National Institutes of Health [F31 NS074842, F31-MH093026-01A1, P30 EY12196]; NINDS P30 Core Center grant [NS072030]; NIH [R01 NS046579]","The authors thank the Lowell laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for the gift of the DIO-synaptophysin-mCherry and DIO-synaptophysin-GFP rAAVs, R.

In many cases, the microbiota is the presumed cause of the variation. Current solutions to account for phenotypic variability include littermate and maternal controls or defined microbial consortia ingnotobiotic mice(6,7). Inconventionally raised mice, the microbiome is transmitted from the dam(2,8,9). Here we show that microbially driven dichotomous faecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in wild-type mice within the same facility mimic the effects of chromosomal mutations. We observe in multiple facilities that vertically transmissible bacteria in IgA-low mice dominantly lower faecal IgA levels in IgA-high mice after co-housing or faecal transplantation. In response to injury, IgA-low mice show increased damage that is transferable by faecal transplantation and driven by faecal IgA differences. We find that bacteria from IgA-low mice degrade the secretory component of secretory IgA as well as IgA itself. These data indicate that phenotypic comparisons between mice must take into account the non-chromosomal hereditary variation between different breeders. We propose faecal IgA as one marker of microbial variability and conclude that co-housing and/or faecal transplantation enables analysis of progeny from different dams.","[Moon, Clara; Baldridge, Megan T.; Wallace, Meghan A.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.; Virgin, Herbert W.; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Virgin, HW (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",virgin@wustl.edu; stappenb@pathology.wustl.edu,,"Baldridge, Megan/0000-0002-7030-6131","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI08488702, DK7161907]; Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America Genetics Initiative; Rainin Foundation; Helmsley Charitable Trust; NIH [T32AI007163, T32CA009547, P30AR048335, P30DK052574]; W.M.

Recently developed therapeutics that overcome tolerogenic mechanisms activate tumour-directed CTLs and are effective in some human cancers(1). Immune mechanisms also affect treatment outcome, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate cancer-specific immune responses by inducing immunogenic cell death and other effector mechanisms(3,4). Our previous studies revealed that B cells recruited by the chemokine CXCL13 into prostate cancer tumours promote the progression of castrate-resistant prostate cancer by producing lymphotoxin, which activates an IkB kinase a (IKK alpha)-BMI1 module in prostate cancer stem cells(5,6). Because castrate-resistant prostate cancer is refractory to most therapies, we examined B cell involvement in the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance. Here we focus on oxaliplatin, an immunogenic chemotherapeutic agent(3,4) that is effective in aggressive prostate cancer(7). We show that mouse B cells modulate the response to low-dose oxaliplatin, which promotes tumour-directed CTL activation by inducing immunogenic cell death. Three different mouse prostate cancer models were refractory to oxaliplatin unless genetically or pharmacologically depleted of B cells. The crucial immunosuppressive B cells are plasmocytes that express IgA, interleukin (IL)-10 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the appearance of which depends on TGF beta receptor signalling. Elimination of these cells, which also infiltrate human-therapy-resistant prostate cancer, allows CTL-dependent eradication of oxaliplatin-treated tumours.","[Shalapour, Shabnam; Font-Burgada, Joan; Di Caro, Giuseppe; Zhong, Zhenyu; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa; Dhar, Debanjan; Ammirante, Massimo; Strasner, Amy; Karin, Michael] UCSD, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Shalapour, Shabnam; Font-Burgada, Joan; Di Caro, Giuseppe; Zhong, Zhenyu; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa; Dhar, Debanjan; Ammirante, Massimo; Strasner, Amy; Hansel, Donna E.; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Willimsky, Gerald] Charite Campus Buch, Inst Immunol, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Jamieson, Christina; Kane, Christopher J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Urol, Dept Surg, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Klatte, Tobias] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Urol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Birner, Peter; Kenner, Lukas] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Pathol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kenner, Lukas] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Canc Res, Clin Inst Pathol,UPLA, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Karin, M (reprint author), UCSD, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,"Dhar, Debanjan/P-3072-2015; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa/A-7131-2017; Zhong, Zhenyu/A-8339-2017","Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa/0000-0002-4236-1985; Kenner, Lukas/0000-0003-2184-1338","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA127923, AI043477]; DFG; German Cancer Consortium [TR36, DKTK]; Genome Research-Austria project 'Inflammobiota' (FWF) [P26011]; Cure Search Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG) [SH721/1-1]; Irvington-CRI; CIRM [TG2-01154]; FIRC/AIRC","We thank L.

Much like transplanted allogeneic organs, allogeneic tumours are reliably rejected by host T cells, even when the tumour and host share the same major histocompatibility complex alleles, the most potent determinants of transplant rejection(6-10). How such tumour-eradicating immunity is initiated remains unknown, although elucidating this process could provide the basis for inducing similar responses against naturally arising tumours. Here we find that allogeneic tumour rejection is initiated in mice by naturally occurring tumour-binding IgG antibodies, which enable dendritic cells (DCs) to internalize tumour antigens and subsequently activate tumour-reactive T cells. We exploited this mechanism to treat autologous and autochthonous tumours successfully. Either systemic administration of DCs loaded with allogeneic-IgG-coated tumour cells or intratumoral injection of allogeneic IgG in combination with DC stimuli induced potent T-cell-mediated antitumour immune responses, resulting in tumour eradication in mouse models of melanoma, pancreas, lung and breast cancer. Moreover, this strategy led to eradication of distant tumours and metastases, as well as the injected primary tumours. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we studied antibodies and cells from patients with lung cancer. T cells from these patients responded vigorously to autologous tumour antigens after culture with allogeneic-IgG-loaded DCs, recapitulating our findings in mice. These results reveal that tumour-binding allogeneic IgG can induce powerful antitumour immunity that can be exploited for cancer immunotherapy.","[Carmi, Yaron; Spitzer, Matthew H.; Linde, Ian L.; Prestwood, Tyler R.; Perlman, Nicola; Davidson, Matthew G.; Kenkel, Justin A.; Segal, Ehud; Bhattacharya, Nupur; Engleman, Edgar G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Spitzer, Matthew H.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baxter Lab Stem Cell Biol, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA; [Burt, Bryan M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA; [Pusapati, Ganesh V.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA","Engleman, EG (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ycarmi76@stanford.edu; edengleman@stanford.edu,,,"NIH [U01 CA141468, 5T32AI007290-27]; NIH NRSA [F31CA189331]; Smith Stanford Graduate Fellowship",We thank F.

The multiple interactions between catalytic domains within the NRPS machinery are further complemented by additional interactions with external enzymes, particularly focused on the final peptide maturation process. An important class of NRPS metabolites that require extensive external modification of the NRPS-bound peptide are the glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs), which include vancomycin and teicoplanin(2,3). These clinically relevant peptide antibiotics undergo cytochrome P450-catalysed oxidative crosslinking of aromatic side chains to achieve their final, active conformation(4-12). However, the mechanism underlying the recruitment of the cytochrome P450 oxygenases to the NRPS-bound peptide was previously unknown. Here we show, through in vitro studies, that the X-domain(13,14), a conserved domain of unknown function present in the final module of all GPA NRPS machineries, is responsible for the recruitment of oxygenases to theN RPS-bound peptide to perform the essential side-chain crosslinking. X-ray crystallography shows that the X-domain is structurally related to condensation domains, but that its amino acid substitutions render it catalytically inactive. We found that the X-domain recruits cytochrome P450 oxygenases to the NRPS and determined the interface by solving the structure of a P450-X-domain complex. Additionally, we demonstrated that the modification of peptide precursors by oxygenases in vitro-in particular the installation of the second crosslink in GPA biosynthesis-occurs only in the presence of the X-domain. Our results indicate that the presentation of peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound substrates for oxidation in GPA biosynthesis requires the presence of the NRPS X-domain to ensure conversion of the precursor peptide into a mature aglycone, and that the carrier protein domain alone is not always sufficient to generate a competent substrate for external cytochrome P450 oxygenases.","[Haslinger, Kristina; Peschke, Madeleine; Brieke, Clara; Maximowitsch, Egle; Cryle, Max J.] Max Planck Inst Med Res, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Cryle, MJ (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Med Res, Jahnstr 29, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Max.Cryle@mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de,"Cryle, Max/H-7656-2017","Cryle, Max/0000-0002-9739-6157; Haslinger, Kristina/0000-0003-1361-1508",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Emmy-Noether Program) [CR 392/1-1],"The authors thank A.

Combining information from several modalities is essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence and how these patterns contribute to behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy. Here we show that combining rnechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous system, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy, spanning multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy. The wiring diagram revealed a complex multilevel rnultimorlal convergence architecture. Using behavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected circuit nodes that trigger the fastest locomotor mode, and others that facilitate it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration contribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel rnultimoclal convergence architecture may be a general feature of multisensory circuits enabling complex input-output functions and selective tuning to ecologically relevant combinations of cues.","[Ohyama, Tomoko; Schneider-Mizell, Casey M.; Fetter, Richard D.; Aleman, Javier Valdes; Franconville, Romain; Rivera-Alba, Marta; Mensh, Brett D.; Branson, Kristin M.; Simpson, Julie H.; Truman, James W.; Cardona, Albert; Zlatic, Marta] Howard Hughes Med Inst Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Cardona, A (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst Janelia Res Campus, 19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",cardonaa@hhmi.org; zlaticm@hhmi.org,,"Rivera-Alba, Marta/0000-0002-8069-385X; Ohyama, Tomoko/0000-0003-1697-1138; Simpson, Julie/0000-0002-6793-7100; Cardona, Albert/0000-0003-4941-6536; Schneider-Mizell, Casey/0000-0001-9477-3853; Franconville, Romain/0000-0002-4440-7297",Janelia HHMI; Institute of Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich; ETH Zurich; SNSF [31003A_132969]; Universitat Zurich Forschungskredit; HHMI Visiting Scientist program at Janelia,"We thank G.

Previous studies suggest that the population of objects emitting soft X-rays (less than 10 kiloelectronvolts) within the surrounding hundreds of parsecs, as well as the population responsible for unresolved X-ray emission extending along the Galactic plane, is dominated by accreting white dwarf systems'. Observations of diffuse hardX-ray (more than 10 kiloelectronvolts) emission in the inner 10 parsecs, however, have been hampered by the limited spatial resolution of previous instruments. Here we report the presence of a distinct hard-X-ray component within the central 4 X 8 parsecs, as revealed by subarcminute-resolution images in the 20-40 kiloelectronvolt range. This emission is more sharply peaked towards the Galactic Centre than is the surface brightness of the soft-X-ray population'. This could indicate a significantly more massive population of accreting white dwarfs, large populations of lowmass X-ray binaries or millisecond pulsars, or particle outflows interacting with the surrounding radiation field, dense molecular material or magnetic fields. However, all these interpretations pose significant challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution, binary formation, and cosmic-ray production in the Galactic Centre.","[Perez, Kerstin; Hailey, Charles J.; Mori, Kaya; Nynka, Melania; Zhang, Shuo] Columbia Univ, Columbia Astrophys Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Perez, Kerstin] Haverford Coll, Haverford, PA 19041 USA; [Bauer, Franz E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Fis, Inst Astrofis, Santiago 22, Chile; [Bauer, Franz E.] Millennium Inst Astrophys, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Bauer, Franz E.] Space Sci Inst, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Krivonos, Roman A.; Barriere, Nicolas M.; Boggs, Steven E.; Craig, William W.; Tomsick, John A.; Zoglauer, Andreas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Space Sci Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Baganoff, Frederick K.] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Christensen, Finn E.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, DTU Space, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Craig, William W.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Grefenstette, Brian W.; Harrison, Fiona A.; Madsen, Kristin K.] CALTECH, Cahill Ctr Astron & Astrophys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Grindlay, Jonathan E.; Hong, Jaesub] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stern, Daniel] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Wik, Daniel R.; Zhang, William W.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Perez, K (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Columbia Astrophys Lab, 550 West 120th St,Room 1027, New York, NY 10027 USA.",kperez1@haverford.edu,"Boggs, Steven/E-4170-2015","Boggs, Steven/0000-0001-9567-4224; Krivonos, Roman/0000-0003-2737-5673; Bauer, Franz Erik/0000-0002-8686-8737; Madsen, Kristin/0000-0003-1252-4891","NASA [NNG08FD60C]; Basal-CATA [PFB-06/2007]; CONICYT-Chile [FONDECYT 1141218, EMBIGGEN Anillo ACT1101]; Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio del Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo [IC120009]","This work was supported by NASA contract no.

A tunable bandgap can be induced in bilayer graphene by an external electric field', and such gapped bilayer graphene is predicted to be a topological insulating phase protected by no-valley mixing symmetry, featuring quantum valley Hall effects and chiral edge states'. Observation of such chiral edge states, however, is challenging because inter-valley scattering is induced by atomic-scale defects at real bilayer graphene edges"". Recent theoretical work""' has shown that domain walls between AB- and BA-stacked bilayer graphene can support protected chiral edge states of quantum valley Hall insulators. Here we report an experimental observation of ballistic (that is, with no scattering of electrons) conducting channels at bilayer graphene domain walls. We employ near-field infrared nanometre-scale microscopy (nanoscopy)'"" to image in situ bilayer graphene layer-stacking domain walls on device substrates, and we fabricate dual-gated field effect transistors based on the domain walls. Unlike single-domain bilayer graphene, which shows gapped insulating behaviour under a vertical electrical field, bilayer graphene domain walls feature one-dimensional valley-polarized conducting channels with a ballistic length of about 400 nanometres at 4 kelvin. Such topologically protected one-dimensional chiral states at bilayer graphene domain walls open up opportunities for exploring unique topological phases and valley physics in graphene.","[Ju, Long; Shi, Zhiwen; Nair, Nityan; Lv, Yinchuan; Jin, Chenhao; Velasco, Jairo, Jr.; Ojeda-Aristizabal, Claudia; Zettl, Alex; Analytis, James; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bechtel, Hans A.; Martin, Michael C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Analytis, James; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Analytis, James; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Analytis, James; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Wang, F (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fengwang76@berkeley.edu,"Shi, Zhiwen/C-4945-2013; Zettl, Alex/O-4925-2016; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; LBNL, MSD/R-6830-2017","Shi, Zhiwen/0000-0002-3928-2960; Zettl, Alex/0000-0001-6330-136X; Ojeda-Aristizabal, Claudia/0000-0003-0816-9727","Office of Basic Energy Science, Department of Energy [DE-SC0003949, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-13-1-0464]; David and Lucile Packard fellowship; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank Y.

A decrease in film thickness to the ultimate limit of the atomic, sub-nanometre length scale, a difficult limit for traditional semiconductors (such as Si and GaAs), would bring wide benefits for applications in ultrathin and flexible electronics, photovoltaics and display technology'. For this, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which can form stable three-atom-thick monolayers(4), provide ideal semiconducting materials with high electrical carrier mobility'-"", and their largescale growth on insulating substrates would enable the batch fabrication of atomically thin high-performance transistors and photodetectors on a technologically relevant scale without film transfer. In addition, their unique electronic band structures provide novel ways of enhancing the functionalities of such devices, including the large excitonic effect"", bandgap modulation"", indirect-todirect bandgap transition"", piezoelectricity' and valleytronics'. However, the large-scale growth of monolayer TMD films with spatial homogeneity and high electrical performance remains an unsolved challenge. Here we report the preparation of high-mobility 4-inch wafer-scale films of monolayer molybdenum disulphide (Mo52) and tungsten disulphide, grown directly on insulating MO, substrates, with excellent spatial homogeneity over the entire films. They are grown with a newly developed, metal-organic chemical vapour deposition technique, and show high electrical performance, including an electron mobility of 30 cm(2) V-1 s(1) at room temperature and 114 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 90K for Mo52, with little dependence on position or channel length. With the use of these films we successfully demonstrate the wafer-scale batch fabrication of highperformance monolayer Mo52 field-effect transistors with a 99% device yield and the multi-level fabrication of vertically stacked transistor devices for three-dimensional circuitry. Our work is a step towards the realization of atomically thin integrated circuitry.","[Kang, Kibum; Huang, Lujie; Kim, Cheol-Joo; Park, Jiwoong] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Xie, Saien; Han, Yimo; Huang, Pinshane Y.; Muller, David] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Mak, Kin Fai; Muller, David; Park, Jiwoong] Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Mak, Kin Fai] Cornell Univ, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Park, J (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jpark@cornell.edu,,"Kim, Cheol-Joo/0000-0002-4312-3866; Huang, Pinshane/0000-0002-1095-1833; Kang, Kibum/0000-0003-1674-1826","AFOSR [FA2386-13-1-4118, FA9550-11-1-0033]; Nano Material Technology Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning [2012M3A7B4049887]; National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Cornell Center for Materials Research [NSF DMR-1120296]; Samsung Advanced Institute for Technology GRO Program; National Science Foundation [ECS-0335765]","We thank P.

Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa''', suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw(4-6). Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events'. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision''''"". Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 +/- 92 years (2 sigma a) for DansgaardOeschger events, including the Bolling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 +/- 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard-Oeschger dynamics.","[Buizert, Christo; Bauska, Thomas K.; Brook, Edward J.; Edwards, Jon S.; Kalk, Michael L.; Lee, James E.; Marcott, Shaun A.; Mitchell, Logan E.; Rhodes, Rachael H.; Rosen, Julia L.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Adrian, Betty; Bencivengo, Brian B.; Hargreaves, Geoffrey M.; Nunn, Richard M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Ice Core Lab, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Ahn, Jinho] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Albert, Mary; Gregory, Stephanie] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Alley, Richard B.; Fegyveresi, John M.; Sowers, Todd A.; Voigt, Donald E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Baggenstos, Daniel; Orsi, Anais J.; Severinghaus, Jeffrey P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bay, Ryan C.; Price, P.

The evolution of the nitrogenfixing enzyme nitrogenase, which reduces atmospheric Ny to organic NH4, thus represented a major breakthrough in the radiation of life, but its timing is uncertain'''. Here we present nitrogen isotope ratios with a mean of 0.0 1.2%0 from marine and fluvial sedimentary rocks of prehnite-pumpellyite to greenschist metamorphic grade between 3.2 and 2.75 billion years ago. These data cannot readily be explained by abiotic processes and therefore suggest biological nitrogen fixation, most probably using molybdenum-based nitrogenase as opposed to other variants that impart significant negative fractionations'. Our data place a minimum age constraint of 3.2 billion years on the origin of biological nitrogen fixation and suggest that molybdenum was bioavailable in the mid-Archaean ocean long before the Great Oxidation Event.","[Stueeken, Eva E.; Buick, Roger; Koehler, Matthew C.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Stueeken, Eva E.; Buick, Roger; Koehler, Matthew C.] Univ Washington, Astrobiol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Guy, Bradley M.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geol, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa","Stueken, EE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",evast@uw.edu,,"Buick, Roger/0000-0003-0139-1659; Stueeken, Eva/0000-0001-6861-2490",Virtual Planetary Laboratory at the University of Washington; Geological Society of America; Agouron Institute,"This work was funded by the Virtual Planetary Laboratory at the University of Washington, a Geological Society of America graduate student research grant to E.E.S., and by an Agouron Institute grant to R.B.

We validated positive results in additional families and in subjects from the general population. Here we show replicated associations with a meta-analysis false discovery rate less than 10-4 between IgE and low methylation at 36 loci. Genes annotated to these loci encode known eosinophil products, and also implicate phospholipid inflammatory mediators, specific transcription factors and mitochondrial proteins. We confirmed that methylation at these loci differed significantly in isolated eosinophils from subjects with and without asthma and high IgE levels.

Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations'', but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features.

In virusplant interactions, one of the major mechanisms for plant antiviral immunity relies on RNA silencing, which is often suppressed by co-evolving virus suppressors, thus enhancing viral pathogenicity in susceptible hosts'. In addition, plants use the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) domain-containing resistance proteins, which recognize viral effectors to activate effector-triggered immunity in a defence mechanism similar to that employed in nonviral infections'''. Unlike most eukaryotic organisms, plants are not known to activate mechanisms of host global translation suppression to fight viruses'''. Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that the constitutive activation of NIK1, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP)(4-6), leads to global translation suppression and translocation of the downstream component RPL 10 to the nucleus, where it interacts with a newly identified MYB-like protein, Lb-INTERACTING MYB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN (LIMYB), to downregulate translational machinery genes fully. LIMYB overexpression represses ribosomal protein genes at the transcriptional level, resulting in protein synthesis inhibition, decreased viral messenger RNA association with polysome fractions and enhanced tolerance to begomovirus. By contrast, the loss of LIMYB function releases the repression of translation-related genes and increases susceptibility to virus infection. Therefore, LIMYB links immune receptor LRR-RLK activation to global translation suppression as an antiviral immunity strategy in plants.","[Zorzatto, Cristiane; Machado, Joao Paulo B.; Lopes, Kenia V.

Emergence and spread of resistance to them' raises risk of wiping out recent gains achieved in reducing worldwide malaria burden and threatens future malaria control and elimination on a global level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed parasite genetic loci associated with artemisinin resistance'''. However, there is no consensus on biochemical targets of artemisinin. Whether and how these targets interact with genes identified by GWAS, remains unknown. Here we provide biochemical and cellular evidence that artemisinins are potent inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinosito1-3-kinase (PfPI3K), revealing an unexpected mechanism of action. In resistant clinical strains, increased PfPI3K was associated with the C580Y mutation in P. falciparum Kelch13 (PfKelch13), a primary marker of artemisinin resistance. Polyubiquitination of PfPI3K and its binding to PfKelch13 were reduced by the PfKelch13 mutation, which limited proteolysis of PfPI3K and thus increased levels of the kinase, as well as its lipid product phosphatidylinosito1-3-phosphate (PI3P). We find PI3P levels to be predictive of artemisinin resistance in both clinical and engineered laboratory parasites as well as across non-isogenic strains. Elevated PI3P induced artemisinin resistance in absence of PfKelch13 mutations, but remained responsive to regulation by PfKelch13. Evidence is presented for PI3P-dependent signalling in which transgenic expression of an additional kinase confers resistance.

Some members of the genus, including Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), can cause lethal haemorrhagic fever in humans. During 2014 an unprecedented ZEBOV outbreak occurred in West Africa and is still ongoing, resulting in over 10,000 deaths, and causing global concern of uncontrolled disease. To meet this challenge a rapid-acting vaccine is needed. Many vaccine approaches have shown promise in being able to protect nonhuman primates against ZEBOV2. In response to the current ZEBOV outbreak several of these vaccines have been fast tracked for human use. However, it is not known whether any of these vaccines can provide protection against the new outbreak Makona strain of ZEBOV. One of these approaches is a first-generation recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/ZEBOV). To address safety concerns associated with this vector, we developed two candidate, further-attenuated rVSV/ZEBOV vaccines. Both attenuated vaccines produced an approximately tenfold lower vaccine-associated viraemia compared to the first-generation vaccine and both provided complete, single-dose protection of macaques from lethal challenge with the Makona outbreak strain of ZEBOV.","[Mire, Chad E.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Agans, Krystle N.; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Galveston Natl Lab, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Mire, Chad E.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Agans, Krystle N.; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Matassov, Demetrius; Latham, Theresa E.; Clarke, David K.; Eldridge, John H.] Profectus BioSci Inc, Dept Virol & Vaccine Vectors, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Xu, Rong; Ota-Setlik, Ayuko; Egan, Michael A.; Eldridge, John H.] Profectus BioSci Inc, Dept Immunol, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA","Geisbert, TW (reprint author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Galveston Natl Lab, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",twgeisbe@utmb.edu,,,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UTMB; Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health [R01AI09881701]","We thank V.

Their systematic targeting by vaccine approaches, however, has been hampered by the fact that every patient's tumour possesses a unique set of mutations (the mutanome') that must first be identified. Recently, we proposed a personalized immunotherapy approach to target the full spectrum of a patient's individual tumour-specific mutationsl. Here we show in three independent murine tumour models that a considerable fraction of non-synonymous cancer mutations is immunogenic and that, unexpectedly, the majority of the immunogenic mutanome is recognized by Cal+ T cells. Vaccination with such Cal+ immunogenic mutations confers strong antitumour activity. Encouraged by these findings, we established a process by which mutations identified by exome sequencing could be selected as vaccine targets solely through bioinformatic prioritization on the basis of their expression levels and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-binding capacity for rapid production as synthetic poly-neo-epitope messenger RNA vaccines. We show that vaccination with such polytope mRNA vaccines induces potent tumour control and complete rejection of established aggressively growing tumours in mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that Cal+ T cell neo-epitope vaccination reshapes the tumour microenvironment and induces cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against an independent immunodominant antigen in mice, indicating orchestration of antigen spread. Finally, we demonstrate an abundance of mutations predicted to bind to MHC class II in human cancers as well by employing the same predictive algorithm on corresponding human cancer types. Thus, the tailored immunotherapy approach introduced here may be regarded as a universally applicable blueprint for comprehensive exploitation of the substantial neo-epitope target repertoire of cancers, enabling the effective targeting of every patient's tumour with vaccines produced 'just in time'.","[Kreiter, Sebastian; Diken, Mustafa; Loewer, Martin; Diekmann, Jan; Boegel, Sebastian; Schroers, Barbara; Vascotto, Fulvia; Castle, John C.; Tadmor, Arbel D.; Tuereci, Oezlem; Sahin, Ugur] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, TRON Translat Oncol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Vormehr, Mathias; van de Roemer, Niels; Huber, Christoph; Sahin, Ugur] Res Ctr Immunotherapy FZI, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Diekmann, Jan; Sahin, Ugur] Biopharmaceut New Technol BioNTech Corp, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Schoenberger, Stephen P.] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Sahin, U (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, TRON Translat Oncol, Freiligrathstr 12, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.",sahin@uni-mainz.de,"Sahin, Ugur/L-4818-2017","Sahin, Ugur/0000-0003-0363-1564; Vormehr, Mathias/0000-0001-7788-3380; Boegel, Sebastian/0000-0001-5425-8304",CI3 excellence cluster program of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),"We thank M.

A tremendous effort has been made to restore p53 activity in cancer therapies'''. However, no effective p53-based therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment owing to the complexity of p53 signalling. Here we demonstrate that genomic deletion of TP53 frequently encompasses essential neighbouring genes, rendering cancer cells with hemizygous TP53 deletion vulnerable to further suppression of such genes. POLR2A is identified as such a gene that is almost always co-deleted with TP53 in human cancers. It encodes the largest and catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is specifically inhibited by a-amanitin"". Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases reveals that POLR2A expression levels are tightly correlated with its gene copy numbers in human colorectal cancer. Suppression of POLR2A with alpha-amanitin or small interfering RNAs selectively inhibits the proliferation, survival and tumorigenic potential of colorectal cancer cells with hemizygous TP53 loss in a p53-independent manner. Previous clinical applications of a-amanitin have been limited owing to its liver toxicity'. However, we found that alpha-amanitin-based antibody-drug conjugates are highly effective therapeutic agents with reduced toxicity"". Here we show that low doses of alpha-amanitin-conjugated anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody lead to complete tumour regression in mouse models of human colorectal cancer with hemizygous deletion of POLR2A. We anticipate that inhibiting POLR2A will be a new therapeutic approach for human cancers containing such common genomic alterations.","[Liu, Yunhua; Han, Cecil; Wan, Guohui; Sood, Anil K.; Lu, Xiongbin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhang, Xinna; Ivan, Cristina; Jiang, Dahai; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynaecol Oncol & Reprod Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhang, Xinna; Ivan, Cristina; Jiang, Dahai; Rodriguez-Aguayo, Cristian; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.; Lu, Xiongbin] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr RNA Interference & Noncoding RNAs, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Huang, Xingxu] ShanghaiTech Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China; [Rodriguez-Aguayo, Cristian; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Paediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Maru, Dipen M.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Pahl, Andreas; Anderl, Jan] Heidelberg Pharma GmbH, D-68526 Ladenburg, Germany; [He, Xiaoming] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ellis, Lee M.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Lu, XB (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",xlu2@mdanderson.org,"He, Xiaoming/C-5499-2008; Wan, Guohui/G-3904-2011; Liu, Yunhua/I-8149-2015","He, Xiaoming/0000-0003-0125-6086; Wan, Guohui/0000-0001-5170-7282; ","National Institutes of Health (NIH), MD Anderson Moon Shots Program [R01 CA136549]; NIH [U54 CA151668]","We thank F.

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions2. We determined the threedimensional structure of MccA to 2.2 A resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion.

The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem cat a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4 A. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO.

However, little is known about when, where and how oxytocin modulates neural circuits to improve social cognition. Here we show how oxytocin enables pup retrieval behaviour in female mice by enhancing auditory cortical pup call responses. Retrieval behaviour required the left but not right auditory cortex, was accelerated by oxytocin in the left auditory cortex, and oxytocin receptors were preferentially expressed in the left auditory cortex. Neural responses to pup calls were lateralized, with co-tuned and temporally precise excitatory and inhibitory responses in the left cortex of maternal but not pup-naive adults.

In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA.

For those forming low-mass stars (<8 solar masses), the competition between self-gravity and turbulent pressure along the dynamically dominant intercloud magnetic field (10 to 100 parsecs) shapes the clouds to be elongated either perpendicularly(4) or parallel(5) to the fields. A recent study(6) also suggested that on the scales of 0.1 to 0.01 parsecs, such fields are dynamically important within cloud cores forming massive stars (>8 solar masses). But whether the core fieldmorphologies are inherited from the intercloud medium or governed by cloud turbulence is unknown, as is the effect of magnetic fields on cloud fragmentation at scales of 10 to 0.1 parsecs(7-9). Here we report magnetic-field maps inferred from polarimetric observations of NGC6334, a region forming massive stars, on the 100 to 0.01 parsec scale. NGC6334 hosts young star-forming sites(10-12) where fields are not severely affected by stellar feedback, and their directions do not change much over the entire scale range. This means that the fields are dynamically important. The ordered fields lead to a self-similar gas fragmentation: at all scales, there exist elongated gas structures nearly perpendicular to the fields. Many gas elongations have density peaks near the ends, which symmetrically pinch the fields. The field strength is proportional to the 0.4th power of the density, which is an indication of anisotropic gas contractions along the field. We conclude that magnetic fields have a crucial role in the fragmentation of NGC6334.","[Li, Hua-bai; Yuen, Ka Ho; Otto, Frank; Leung, Po Kin] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sridharan, T.

Pioneering photon counting experiments, such as the intensity interferometry performed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss(3) to measure the angular width of visible stars, have played a critical role in our understanding of the full quantum nature of light(4). As with matter at the atomic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics also govern the properties of macroscopic mechanical objects, providing fundamental quantum limits to the sensitivity of mechanical sensors and transducers. Current research in cavity optomechanics seeks to use light to explore the quantum properties of mechanical systems ranging in size from kilogram-mass mirrors to nanoscale membranes(5), as well as to develop technologies for precision sensing(6) and quantum information processing(7,8). Here we use an optical probe and single-photon detection to study the acoustic emission and absorption processes in a silicon nanomechanical resonator, and perform a measurement similar to that used by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure correlations in the emitted phonons as the resonator undergoes a parametric instability formally equivalent to that of a laser(9). Owing to the cavity-enhanced coupling of light with mechanical motion, this effective phonon counting technique has a noise equivalent phonon sensitivity of 0.89 +/- 0.05. With straightforward improvements to this method, a variety of quantum state engineering tasks using mesoscopic mechanical resonators would be enabled(10), including the generation and heralding of single-phonon Fock states(11) and the quantum entanglement of remote mechanical elements(12,13).","[Cohen, Justin D.; Meenehan, Sean M.; MacCabe, Gregory S.; Groeblacher, Simon; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cohen, Justin D.; Meenehan, Sean M.; MacCabe, Gregory S.; Groeblacher, Simon; Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Senior Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Groeblacher, Simon] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol VCQ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.] Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Marsili, Francesco; Shaw, Matthew D.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,,,DARPA; Institute for Quantum Information and Matter; NSF Physics Frontiers Center; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech; NASA; NSERC; Marie Curie International Out-going Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme,"We thank F.

Landscapes tend towards an equilibrium in which rivers attain a stable grade that balances the tectonic production of elevation and with hillslopes that attain a gradient steep enough to transport material to river channels. Equilibrium low-relief surfaces are typically found at low elevations, graded to sea level. However, there are many examples of high-elevation, low-relief surfaces, often referred to as relict landscapes(1,2), or as elevated peneplains(3). These do not grade to sea level and are typically interpreted as uplifted old landscapes, preserving former, more moderate tectonic conditions(4). Here we test this model of landscape evolution through digital topographic analysis of a set of purportedly relict landscapes on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, one of the most geographically complex, climatically varied and biologically diverse regions of the world. We find that, in contrast to theory, the purported surfaces are not consistent with progressive establishment of a new, steeper, river grade, and therefore they cannot necessarily be interpreted as a remnant of an old, low relief surface. We propose an alternative model, supported by numerical experiments, in which tectonic deformation has disrupted the regional river network, leaving remnants of it isolated and starved of drainage area and thus unable to balance tectonic uplift. The implication is that the state of low relief with low erosion rate is developing in situ, rather than preserving past erosional conditions.","[Yang, Rong; Willett, Sean D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Geol Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Goren, Liran] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Geol & Environm Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Yang, R (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Geol Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rong.yang@erdw.ethz.ch,"Willett, Sean/B-1716-2008",,,,,33,40.0,44,13.0,56.0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Apr,2015.0,520.0,7548.0,,,,,526,+,,10.1038/nature14354,,14.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CG5LX,WOS:000353334500039,25903633.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,liran,goren,female,0.5,28,na,na

Uniform, terrestrial-mantle-like W isotopic compositions have been reported(1,2) among crystallization products of the lunar magma ocean. These observations were interpreted to reflect formation of the Moon and crystallization of the lunar magma ocean after Hf-182 was no longer extant-that is, more than about 60 million years after the Solar System formed. Here we present W isotope data for three lunar samples that are more precise by a factor of >= 4 than those previously reported(1,2). The new data reveal that the lunar mantle has a well-resolved W-182 excess of 20.6 +/- 5.1 parts per million (+/- 2 standard deviations), relative to the modern terrestrial mantle. The offset between the mantles of the Moon and the modern Earth is best explained by assuming that the W isotopic compositions of the two bodies were identical immediately following formation of the Moon, and that they then diverged as a result of disproportional late accretion to the Earth and Moon(3,4). One implication of this model is that metal from the core of the Moon-forming impactor must have efficiently stripped the Earth's mantle of highly siderophile elements on its way to merge with the terrestrial core, requiring a substantial, but still poorly defined, level of metal-silicate equilibration.","[Touboul, Mathieu; Puchtel, Igor S.; Walker, Richard J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, Isotope Geochem Lab, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Touboul, M (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, Labex LIO, F-69364 Lyon 7, France.",mathieu.touboul@ens-lyon.fr; ipuchtel@umd.edu; rjwalker@umd.edu,"Walker, Richard/K-6869-2016","Walker, Richard/0000-0003-0348-2407",NASA [NNX13AF83G],This work was supported by NASA Cosmochemistry grant NNX13AF83G.

Core formation should have removed the highly siderophile elements (HSE) from Earth's primitive mantle (that is, the bulk silicate Earth), yet HSE abundances are higher than expected(2). One explanation for this overabundance is that a 'late veneer' of primitive material was added to the bulk silicate Earth after the core formed(2). To test this hypothesis, tungsten isotopes are useful for two reasons: first, because the late veneer material had a different W-182/W-184 ratio to that of the bulk silicate Earth, and second, proportionally more material was added to the Earth than to the Moon(3). Thus, if a late veneer did occur, the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon must have different W-182/W-184 ratios. Moreover, the Moon-forming impact would also have created W-182 differences because the mantle and core material of the impactor with distinct W-182/W-184 would have mixed with the proto-Earth during the giant impact. However the W-182/W-184 of the Moon has not been determined precisely enough to identify signatures of a late veneer or the giant impact. Here, using more-precise measurement techniques, we show that the Moon exhibits a W-182 excess of 27 +/- 4 parts per million over the present-day bulk silicate Earth. This excess is consistent with the expected W-182 difference resulting from a late veneer with a total mass and composition inferred from HSE systematics(2). Thus, our data independently show that HSE abundances in the bulk silicate Earth were established after the giant impact and core formation, as predicted by the late veneer hypothesis. But, unexpectedly, we find that before the late veneer, no W-182 anomaly existed between the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon, even though one should have arisen through the giant impact. The origin of the homogeneous W-182 of the pre-late-veneer bulk silicate Earth and the Moon is enigmatic and constitutes a challenge to current models of lunar origin.","[Kruijer, Thomas S.; Kleine, Thorsten; Fischer-Goedde, Mario; Sprung, Peter] Univ Munster, Inst Planetol, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Kruijer, TS (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Planetol, Wilhelm Klemm Str 10, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",thomas.kruijer@wwu.de,"Kleine, Thorsten/S-2792-2017","Kleine, Thorsten/0000-0003-4657-5961",,,,60,45.0,45,10.0,58.0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Apr,2015.0,520.0,7548.0,,,,,534,+,,10.1038/nature14360,,15.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CG5LX,WOS:000353334500041,25855296.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,peter,sprung,male,1,4373,na,na
